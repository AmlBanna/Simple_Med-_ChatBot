Routes of Drug Administration\nThe route of administration is determined by properties of the drug (for example, water or lipid solubility,\nionization) and by the therapeutic objectives (for example, the need for a rapid onset, the need for long-term\ntreatment, or restriction of delivery to a local site). Major routes of drug administration include enteral, parenteral,\nand topical, among others (Figure 1.2).\nFigure 1.2 Commonly used routes of drug administration. IV = intravenous; IM =\nintramuscular; SC = subcutaneous.\n22\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 23 ---\n\nA.  Enteral\nEnteral administration (administering a drug by mouth) is the most common, convenient, and economical method of\ndrug administration. The drug may be swallowed, allowing oral delivery, or it may be placed under the tongue\n(sublingual) or between the gums and cheek (buccal), facilitating direct absorption into the bloodstream.\n1.  Oral\nOral administration provides many advantages. Oral drugs are easily self-administered, and toxicities and/or\noverdose of oral drugs may be overcome with antidotes, such as activated charcoal. However, the pathways involved\nin oral drug absorption are the most complicated, and the low gastric pH inactivates some drugs. A wide range of\noral preparations is available including enteric-coated and extended-release preparations.\na.  Enteric-coated preparations\nAn enteric coating is a chemical envelope that protects the drug from stomach acid, delivering it instead to the less\nacidic intestine, where the coating dissolves and releases the drug. Enteric coating is useful for certain drugs (for\nexample, omeprazole) that are acid labile, and for drugs that are irritating to the stomach, such as aspirin.\nb.  Extended-release preparations\nExtended-release (abbreviated ER, XR, XL, SR, etc.) medications have special coatings or ingredients that control\ndrug release, thereby allowing for slower absorption and prolonged duration of action. ER formulations can be\ndosed less frequently and may improve patient compliance. In addition, ER formulations may maintain\nconcentrations within the therapeutic range over a longer duration, as opposed to immediate-release dosage forms,\nwhich may result in larger peaks and troughs in plasma concentration. ER formulations are advantageous for drugs\nwith short half-lives. For example, the half-life of oral morphine is 2 to 4 hours, and it must be administered six\ntimes daily to provide continuous pain relief. However, only two doses are needed when extended-release tablets are\nused.\n2.  Sublingual/buccal\nThe sublingual route involves placement of drug under the tongue. The buccal route involves placement of drug\nbetween the cheek and gum. Both the sublingual and buccal routes of absorption have several advantages, including\nease of administration, rapid absorption, bypass of the harsh gastrointestinal (GI) environment, and avoidance of\nfirst-pass metabolism (see discussion of first-pass metabolism below).\n23\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 24 ---\n\nB.  Parenteral\nThe parenteral route introduces drugs directly into the systemic circulation. Parenteral administration is used for\ndrugs that are poorly absorbed from the GI tract (for example, heparin) or unstable in the GI tract (for example,\ninsulin). Parenteral administration is also used for patients unable to take oral medications (unconscious patients)\nand in circumstances that require a rapid onset of action. Parenteral administration provides the most control over\nthe dose of drug delivered to the body. However, this route of administration is irreversible and may cause pain,\nfear, local tissue damage, and infections. The four major parenteral routes are intravascular (intravenous or intra-\narterial), intramuscular, subcutaneous, and intradermal (Figure 1.3).\n24\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 25 ---\n\n25\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 26 ---\n\nFigure 1.3 A. Schematic representation of subcutaneous and intramuscular injection. B.\nPlasma concentrations of midazolam after intravenous and intramuscular injection.\n1.  Intravenous (IV)\nIV injection is the most common parenteral route. It is useful for drugs that are not absorbed orally, such as the\nneuromuscular blocker rocuronium. IV delivery permits a rapid effect and a maximum degree of control over the\namount of drug delivered. When injected as a bolus, the full amount of drug is delivered to the systemic circulation\nalmost immediately. If administered as an IV infusion, the drug is infused over a longer period, resulting in lower\npeak plasma concentrations and an increased duration of circulating drug.\n2.  Intramuscular (IM)\nDrugs administered IM can be in aqueous solutions, which are absorbed rapidly, or in specialized depot\npreparations, which are absorbed slowly. Depot preparations often consist of a suspension of drug in a nonaqueous\nvehicle, such as polyethylene glycol. As the vehicle diffuses out of the muscle, drug precipitates at the site of\ninjection. The drug then dissolves slowly, providing a sustained dose over an extended interval.\n3.  Subcutaneous (SC)\nLike IM injection, SC injection provides absorption via simple diffusion and is slower than the IV route. SC\ninjection minimizes the risks of hemolysis or thrombosis associated with IV injection and may provide constant,\nslow, and sustained effects. This route should not be used with drugs that cause tissue irritation, because severe pain\nand necrosis may occur.\n4.  Intradermal (ID)\nThe intradermal (ID) route involves injection into the dermis, the more vascular layer of skin under the epidermis.\nAgents for diagnostic determination and desensitization are usually administered by this route.\n26\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 27 ---\n\nC.  Other\n1.  Oral inhalation and nasal preparations\nBoth the oral inhalation and nasal routes of administration provide rapid delivery of drug across the large surface\narea of mucous membranes of the respiratory tract and pulmonary epithelium. Drug effects are almost as rapid as are\nthose with IV bolus. Drugs that are gases (for example, some anesthetics) and those that can be dispersed in an\naerosol are administered via inhalation. This route is effective and convenient for patients with respiratory disorders\nsuch as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, because drug is delivered directly to the site of action,\nthereby minimizing systemic side effects. The nasal route involves topical administration of drugs directly into the\nnose, and it is often used for patients with allergic rhinitis.\n2.  Intrathecal/intraventricular\nThe blood–brain barrier typically delays or prevents the absorption of drugs into the central nervous system (CNS).\nWhen local, rapid effects are needed, it is necessary to introduce drugs directly into the cerebrospinal fluid.\n3.  Topical\nTopical application is used when a local effect of the drug is desired.\n4.  Transdermal\nThis route of administration achieves systemic effects by application of drugs to the skin, usually via a transdermal\npatch (Figure 1.4). The rate of absorption can vary markedly, depending on the physical characteristics of the skin at\nthe site of application, as well as the lipid solubility of the drug.\n27\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 28 ---\n\nFigure 1.4 A. Schematic representation of a transdermal patch. B. Transdermal nicotine\npatch applied to the arm.\n28\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 29 ---\n\n5.  Rectal\nBecause 50% of the drainage of the rectal region bypasses the portal circulation, the biotransformation of drugs by\nthe liver is minimized with rectal administration. The rectal route has the additional advantage of preventing\ndestruction of the drug in the GI environment. This route is also useful if the drug induces vomiting when given\norally, if the patient is already vomiting, or if the patient is unconscious. Rectal absorption is often erratic and\nincomplete, and many drugs irritate the rectal mucosa. Figure 1.5 summarizes characteristics of the common routes\nof administration, along with example drugs.\nFigure 1.5 The absorption pattern, advantages, and disadvantages of the most common\nroutes of administration.\n29\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 30 ---\n\nIII.  Absorption of Drugs\nAbsorption is the transfer of a drug from the site of administration to the bloodstream. The rate and extent of\nabsorption depend on the environment where the drug is absorbed, chemical characteristics of the drug, and the\nroute of administration (which influences bioavailability). Routes of administration other than intravenous may\nresult in partial absorption and lower bioavailability.\n30\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 31 ---\n\nA.  Mechanisms of absorption of drugs from the GI tract\nDepending on their chemical properties, drugs may be absorbed from the GI tract by passive diffusion, facilitated\ndiffusion, active transport, or endocytosis (Figure 1.6).\n31\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 32 ---\n\n32\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 33 ---\n\nFigure 1.6 Schematic representation of drugs crossing a cell membrane. ATP =\nadenosine triphosphate; ADP = adenosine diphosphate.\n1.  Passive diffusion\nThe driving force for passive diffusion of a drug is the concentration gradient across a membrane separating two\nbody compartments. In other words, the drug moves from an area of high concentration to one of lower\nconcentration. Passive diffusion does not involve a carrier, is not saturable, and shows low structural specificity. The\nvast majority of drugs are absorbed by this mechanism. Water-soluble drugs penetrate the cell membrane through\naqueous channels or pores, whereas lipid-soluble drugs readily move across most biologic membranes due to\nsolubility in the membrane lipid bilayers.\n2.  Facilitated diffusion\nOther agents can enter the cell through specialized transmembrane carrier proteins that facilitate the passage of large\nmolecules. These carrier proteins undergo conformational changes, allowing the passage of drugs or endogenous\nmolecules into the interior of cells. This process is known as facilitated diffusion. It does not require energy, can be\nsaturated, and may be inhibited by compounds that compete for the carrier.\n3.  Active transport\nThis mode of drug entry also involves specific carrier proteins that span the membrane. However, active transport is\nenergy dependent, driven by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). It is capable of moving drugs against a\nconcentration gradient, from a region of low drug concentration to one of higher concentration. The process is\nsaturable. Active transport systems are selective and may be competitively inhibited by other cotransported\nsubstances.\n4.  Endocytosis and exocytosis\nThis type of absorption is used to transport drugs of exceptionally large size across the cell membrane. Endocytosis\ninvolves engulfment of a drug by the cell membrane and transport into the cell by pinching off the drug-filled\nvesicle. Exocytosis is the reverse of endocytosis. Many cells use exocytosis to secrete substances out of the cell\nthrough a similar process of vesicle formation. Vitamin B12 is transported across the gut wall by endocytosis,\nwhereas certain neurotransmitters (for example, norepinephrine) are stored in intracellular vesicles in the nerve\nterminal and released by exocytosis.\n33\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 34 ---\n\nB.  Factors influencing absorption\n1.  Effect of pH on drug absorption\nMost drugs are either weak acids or weak bases. Acidic drugs (HA) release a proton (H+), causing a charged anion\n(A−) to form:\nWeak bases (BH+) can also release an H+. However, the protonated form of basic drugs is usually charged, and loss\nof a proton produces the uncharged base (B):\nA drug passes through membranes more readily if it is uncharged (Figure 1.7). Thus, for a weak acid, the uncharged,\nprotonated HA can permeate through membranes, and A− cannot. For a weak base, the uncharged form B penetrates\nthrough the cell membrane, but the protonated form BH+ does not. Therefore, the effective concentration of the\npermeable form of each drug at its absorption site is determined by the relative concentrations of the charged and\nuncharged forms. The ratio between the two forms is, in turn, determined by the pH at the site of absorption and by\nthe strength of the weak acid or base, which is represented by the ionization constant, pKa (Figure 1.8). [Note: The\npKa is a measure of the strength of the interaction of a compound with a proton. The lower the pKa of a drug, the\nmore acidic it is. Conversely, the higher the pKa, the more basic is the drug.] Distribution equilibrium is achieved\nwhen the permeable form of a drug achieves an equal concentration in all body water spaces.\n34\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 35 ---\n\n35\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 36 ---\n\nFigure 1.7 A. Diffusion of the nonionized form of a weak acid through a lipid membrane.\nB. Diffusion of the nonionized form of a weak base through a lipid membrane.\nFigure 1.8 The distribution of a drug between its ionized and nonionized forms depends\non the ambient pH and pKa of the drug. For illustrative purposes, the drug has been\nassigned a pKa of 6.5.\n2.  Blood flow to the absorption site\nThe intestines receive much more blood flow than does the stomach, so absorption from the intestine is favored over\nthe stomach. [Note: Shock severely reduces blood flow to cutaneous tissues, thereby minimizing absorption from SC\nadministration.]\n3.  Total surface area available for absorption\nWith a surface rich in brush borders containing microvilli, the intestine has a surface area about 1000-fold that of the\nstomach, making absorption of the drug across the intestine more efficient.\n4.  Contact time at the absorption surface\nIf a drug moves through the GI tract very quickly, as can happen with severe diarrhea, it is not well absorbed.\nConversely, anything that delays the transport of the drug from the stomach to the intestine delays the rate of\nabsorption. [Note: The presence of food in the stomach both dilutes the drug and slows gastric emptying. Therefore,\na drug taken with a meal is generally absorbed more slowly.]\n5.  Expression of P-glycoprotein\nP-glycoprotein is a transmembrane transporter protein responsible for transporting various molecules, including\ndrugs, across cell membranes (Figure 1.9). It is expressed in tissues throughout the body, including the liver,\nkidneys, placenta, intestines, and brain capillaries, and is involved in transportation of drugs from tissues to blood.\nThat is, it “pumps” drugs out of cells. Thus, in areas of high expression, P-glycoprotein reduces drug absorption. In\naddition to transporting many drugs out of cells, it is also associated with multidrug resistance.\n36\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 37 ---\n\nFigure 1.9 The six membrane-spanning loops of the P-glycoprotein form a central\nchannel for the ATP-dependent pumping of drugs from the cell.\n37\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 38 ---\n\nC.  Bioavailability\nBioavailability is the rate and extent to which an administered drug reaches the systemic circulation. For example, if\n100 mg of a drug is administered orally and 70 mg is absorbed unchanged, the bioavailability is 0.7 or 70%.\nDetermining bioavailability is important for calculating drug dosages for nonintravenous routes of administration.\n1.  Determination of bioavailability\nBioavailability is determined by comparing plasma levels of a drug after a particular route of administration (for\nexample, oral administration) with levels achieved by IV administration. After IV administration, 100% of the drug\nrapidly enters the circulation. When the drug is given orally, only part of the administered dose appears in the\nplasma. By plotting plasma concentrations of the drug versus time, the area under the curve (AUC) can be measured.\nA schematic depiction of determination of bioavailability is provided in Figure 1.10.\nFigure 1.10 Determination of the bioavailability of a drug. AUC = area under curve; IV\n= intravenous.\n2.  Factors that influence bioavailability\nIn contrast to IV administration, which confers 100% bioavailability, orally administered drugs often undergo first-\npass metabolism. This biotransformation, in addition to chemical and physical characteristics of the drug, determines\nthe rate and extent to which the agent reaches the systemic circulation.\na.  First-pass hepatic metabolism\nWhen a drug is absorbed from the GI tract, it enters the portal circulation before entering the systemic circulation\n(Figure 1.11). If the drug is rapidly metabolized in the liver or gut wall during this initial passage, the amount of\nunchanged drug entering the systemic circulation is decreased. This is referred to as first-pass metabolism. [Note:\nFirst-pass metabolism by the intestine or liver limits the efficacy of many oral medications. For example, more than\n90% of nitroglycerin is cleared during first-pass metabolism. Hence, it is primarily administered via the sublingual,\ntransdermal, or intravenous route.] Drugs with high first-pass metabolism should be given in doses sufficient to\nensure that enough active drug reaches the desired site of action.38\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 39 ---\n\nFigure 1.11 First-pass metabolism can occur with orally administered drugs. IV =\nintravenous.\n39\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 40 ---\n\nb.  Solubility of the drug\nVery hydrophilic drugs are poorly absorbed because of the inability to cross lipid-rich cell membranes.\nParadoxically, drugs that are extremely lipophilic are also poorly absorbed, because they are insoluble in aqueous\nbody fluids and, therefore, cannot gain access to the surface of cells. For a drug to be readily absorbed, it must be\nlargely lipophilic, yet have some solubility in aqueous solutions. This is one reason why many drugs are either weak\nacids or weak bases.\nc.  Chemical instability\nSome drugs, such as penicillin G, are unstable in the pH of gastric contents. Others, such as insulin, are destroyed in\nthe GI tract by degradative enzymes.\nd.  Nature of the drug formulation\nDrug absorption may be altered by factors unrelated to the chemistry of the drug. For example, particle size, salt\nform, crystal polymorphism, enteric coatings, and the presence of excipients (such as binders and dispersing agents)\ncan influence the ease of dissolution and, therefore, alter the rate of absorption.\n40\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 41 ---\n\nD.  Bioequivalence and other types of equivalence\nTwo drug formulations are bioequivalent if they show comparable bioavailability and similar times to achieve peak\nblood concentrations. Two drug formulations are therapeutically equivalent if they are pharmaceutically equivalent\n(that is, they have the same dosage form, contain the same active ingredient at the same strength, and use the same\nroute of administration) with similar clinical and safety profiles. Thus, therapeutic equivalence requires that drug\nproducts are bioequivalent and pharmaceutically equivalent.\n41\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 42 ---\n\nIV.  Drug Distribution\nDrug distribution is the process by which a drug reversibly leaves the bloodstream and enters the extracellular fluid\nand tissues. For drugs administered IV, absorption is not a factor, and the initial phase immediately following\nadministration represents the distribution phase, during which the drug rapidly leaves the circulation and enters the\ntissues (Figure 1.12). The distribution of a drug from the plasma to the interstitium depends on cardiac output and\nlocal blood flow, capillary permeability, tissue volume, degree of binding of the drug to plasma and tissue proteins,\nand relative lipophilicity of the drug.\nFigure 1.12 Drug concentrations in serum after a single injection of drug. Assume that\nthe drug distributes and is subsequently eliminated.\n42\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 43 ---\n\nA.  Blood flow\nThe rate of blood flow to the tissue capillaries varies widely. For instance, blood flow to “vessel-rich organs” (brain,\nliver, and kidney) is greater than that to the skeletal muscles. Adipose tissue, skin, and viscera have still lower rates\nof blood flow. Variation in blood flow partly explains the short duration of hypnosis produced by an IV bolus of\npropofol  (see",

A subsequent slower distribution to skeletal muscle and adipose tissue lowers\nthe plasma concentration so that the drug diffuses out of the CNS, down the concentration gradient, and\nconsciousness is regained.\n43\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 44 ---\n\nB.  Capillary permeability\nCapillary permeability is determined by capillary structure and by the chemical nature of the drug. Capillary\nstructure varies in terms of the fraction of the basement membrane exposed by slit junctions between endothelial\ncells. In the liver and spleen, a significant portion of the basement membrane is exposed due to large, discontinuous\ncapillaries through which large plasma proteins can pass ( Figure 1.13A). In the brain, the capillary structure is\ncontinuous, and there are no slit junctions (Figure 1.13B ). To enter the brain, drugs must pass through the\nendothelial cells of the CNS capillaries or undergo active transport. For example, a specific transporter carries\nlevodopa into the brain. Lipid-soluble drugs readily penetrate the CNS because they dissolve in the endothelial cell\nmembrane. By contrast, ionized or polar drugs generally fail to enter the CNS because they cannot pass through the\nendothelial cells that have no slit junctions ( Figure 1.13C ). These closely juxtaposed cells form tight junctions that\nconstitute the blood–brain barrier.\n44\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 45 ---\n\n45\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 46 ---\n\nFigure 1.13 Cross section of liver and brain capillaries.\n46\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 47 ---\n\nC.  Binding of drugs to plasma proteins and tissues\n1.  Binding to plasma proteins\nReversible binding to plasma proteins sequesters drugs in a nondiffusible form and slows transfer out of the vascular\ncompartment. Albumin is the major drug-binding protein, and it may act as a drug reservoir. As the concentration of\nfree drug decreases due to elimination, the bound drug dissociates from albumin. This maintains the free-drug\nconcentration as a constant fraction of the total drug in the plasma.\n2.  Binding to tissue proteins\nMany drugs accumulate in tissues, leading to higher concentrations in tissues than in interstitial fluid and blood.\nDrugs may accumulate because of binding to lipids, proteins, or nucleic acids. Drugs may also undergo active\ntransport into tissues. Tissue reservoirs may serve as a major source of the drug and prolong its actions or cause\nlocal drug toxicity. (For example, acrolein, the metabolite of cyclophosphamide, can cause hemorrhagic cystitis\nbecause it accumulates in the bladder.)\n47\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 48 ---\n\nD.  Lipophilicity\nThe chemical nature of a drug strongly influences its ability to cross cell membranes. Lipophilic drugs readily move\nacross most biologic membranes. These drugs dissolve in the lipid membranes and penetrate the entire cell surface.\nThe major factor influencing the distribution of lipophilic drugs is blood flow to the area. By contrast, hydrophilic\ndrugs do not readily penetrate cell membranes and must pass through slit junctions.\n48\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 49 ---\n\nE.  Volume of distribution\nThe apparent volume of distribution, Vd, is defined as the fluid volume that is required to contain the entire drug in\nthe body at the same concentration measured in the plasma. It is calculated by dividing the dose that ultimately gets\ninto the systemic circulation by the plasma concentration at time zero (C0).\nAlthough Vd has no physiologic or physical basis, it can be useful to compare the distribution of a drug with the\nvolumes of the water compartments in the body.\n1.  Distribution into the water compartments in the body\nOnce a drug enters the body, it has the potential to distribute into any one of the three functionally distinct\ncompartments of body water or to become sequestered in a cellular site.\na.  Plasma compartment\nIf a drug has a high molecular weight or is extensively protein bound, it is too large to pass through the slit junctions\nof the capillaries and, thus, is effectively trapped within the plasma (vascular) compartment. As a result, it has a low\nVd that approximates the plasma volume, or about 4 L in a 70-kg individual. Heparin (see",

Concentration data are plotted on a\nlog scale.\nFor example, if 10 mg of drug is injected into a patient and the plasma concentration is extrapolated back to time\nzero, and C0 = 1 mg/L (from the graph in Figure 1.14B ), then Vd = 10 mg/1 mg/L = 10 L.\n3.  Effect of V d on drug half-life\nVd has an important influence on the half-life of a drug, because drug elimination depends on the amount of drug\ndelivered to the liver or kidney (or other organs where metabolism occurs) per unit of time. Delivery of drug to the\norgans of elimination depends not only on blood flow but also on the fraction of drug in the plasma. If a drug has a\nlarge Vd, most of the drug is in the extraplasmic space and is unavailable to the excretory organs. Therefore, any\nfactor that increases Vd can increase the half-life and extend the duration of action of the drug. [Note: An\nexceptionally large Vd indicates considerable sequestration of the drug in some tissues or compartments.]\n51\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 52 ---\n\nV.  Drug Clearance Through Metabolism\nOnce a drug enters the body, the process of elimination begins. The three major routes of elimination are hepatic\nmetabolism, biliary elimination, and urinary excretion. [Note: Elimination is irreversible removal of drug from the\nbody. It involves biotransformation (drug metabolism) and excretion. Excretion is removal of intact drug from the\nbody.] Together, these elimination processes decrease the plasma concentration exponentially. That is, a constant\nfraction of the drug is eliminated in a given unit of time (Figure 1.14A). Metabolism results in products with\nincreased polarity, which allows the drug to be eliminated. Clearance (CL) estimates the volume of blood from\nwhich the drug is cleared per unit of time. Total CL is a composite estimate reflecting all mechanisms of drug\nelimination and is calculated as follows:\nwhere t1/2 is the elimination half-life, Vd is the apparent volume of distribution, and 0.693 is the natural log constant.\nDrug half-life is often used as a measure of drug CL, because, for many drugs, Vd is a constant.\n52\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 53 ---\n\nA.  Kinetics of metabolism\n1.  First-order kinetics\nThe metabolic transformation of drugs is catalyzed by enzymes, and most of the reactions obey Michaelis-Menten\nkinetics, where Km is Michaelis constant (the substrate concentration at half maximal velocity).\nIn most clinical situations, the concentration of the drug, [C], is much less than the Michaelis constant, Km, and the\nMichaelis-Menten equation reduces to\nThat is, the rate of drug metabolism and elimination is directly proportional to the concentration of free drug, and\nfirst-order kinetics is observed (Figure 1.15). This means that a constant fraction of drug is metabolized per unit of\ntime (that is, with each half-life, the concentration decreases by 50%). First-order kinetics is also referred to as linear\nkinetics.\n53\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 54 ---\n\nFigure 1.15 Effect of drug dose on the rate of metabolism.\n2.  Zero-order kinetics\nWith a few drugs, such as aspirin, ethanol , and phenytoin, the doses are very large. Therefore, [C] is much greater\nthan Km, and the velocity equation becomes\nThe enzyme is saturated by a high free drug concentration, and the rate of metabolism remains constant over time.\nThis is called zero-order kinetics (also called nonlinear kinetics). A constant amount of drug is metabolized per unit\nof time. The rate of elimination is constant and does not depend on the drug concentration.\n54\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 55 ---\n\nB.  Reactions of drug metabolism\nThe kidney cannot efficiently excrete lipophilic drugs that readily cross cell membranes and are reabsorbed in the\ndistal convoluted tubules. Therefore, lipid-soluble agents are first metabolized into more polar (hydrophilic)\nsubstances in the liver via two general sets of reactions, called phase I and phase II (Figure 1.16).\nFigure 1.16 The biotransformation of drugs.\n1.  Phase I\nPhase I reactions convert lipophilic drugs into more polar molecules by introducing or unmasking a polar functional\ngroup, such as –OH or –NH2. Phase I reactions usually involve reduction, oxidation, or hydrolysis. Phase I\nmetabolism may increase, decrease, or have no effect on pharmacologic activity.\na.  Phase I reactions utilizing the P450 system\nThe phase I reactions most frequently involved in drug metabolism are catalyzed by the cytochrome P450 (CYP)\nsystem. The P450 system is important for the metabolism of many endogenous compounds (such as steroids, lipids)\nand for the biotransformation of exogenous substances (drugs, carcinogens, and environmental pollutants). CYP is a\nsuperfamily of heme-containing isozymes located in most cells, but primarily in the liver and GI tract.\n[1]  Nomenclature\nThe family name is indicated by the Arabic number that follows CYP, and the capital letter designates the\nsubfamily, for example, CYP3A (Figure 1.17). A second number indicates the specific isozyme, as in CYP3A4.\n55\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 56 ---\n\nFigure 1.17 Relative contribution of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms to drug\nbiotransformation.\n[2]  Specificity\nBecause there are many different genes that encode multiple enzymes, there are many different P450 isoforms.\nThese enzymes have the capacity to modify a large number of structurally diverse substrates. In addition, an\nindividual drug may be a substrate for more than one isozyme. Four isozymes (CYP3A4/5, CYP2D6, CYP2C8/9,\nand CYP1A2) are responsible for the vast majority of P450-catalyzed reactions (Figure 1.17). Considerable amounts\nof CYP3A4 are found in intestinal mucosa, accounting for first-pass metabolism of drugs such as chlorpromazine\nand clonazepam.\n[3]  Genetic variability\nP450 enzymes exhibit considerable genetic variability among individuals and racial groups. Variations in P450\nactivity may alter drug efficacy and the risk of adverse events. CYP2D6, in particular, exhibits genetic\npolymorphism. CYP2D6 mutations result in very low capacities to metabolize substrates. For example, some\nindividuals obtain no benefit from the opioid analgesic codeine, because they lack the CYP2D6 enzyme that\nactivates the drug. Similar polymorphisms have been characterized for the CYP2C subfamily of isozymes. For\ninstance, clopidogrel  carries a warning that patients who are CYP2C19 “poor metabolizers” have a diminished\nantiplatelet effect when taking this drug and an alternative medication should be considered. Clopidogrel  is a\nprodrug, and CYP2C19 activity is required to convert it to the active metabolite.\n[4]  CYP inducers\nThe CYP450-dependent enzymes are an important target for pharmacokinetic drug interactions. Certain drugs (for\nexample, phenobarbital , rifampin, and carbamazepine) are capable of inducing CYP isozymes. This results in\nincreased biotransformation of drugs and can lead to significant decreases in plasma concentrations of drugs\nmetabolized by these CYP isozymes, often with concurrent loss of pharmacologic effect. For example, rifampin, an\nantituberculosis drug (see",

CYP = cytochrome P.\n*Unlike most other CYP450 enzymes, CYP2D6 is not very susceptible to enzyme\ninduction.\n[5]  CYP inhibitors\nInhibition of drug metabolism can lead to significant increases in plasma drug concentration and resultant adverse\neffects or drug toxicity. The most common form of inhibition is through competition for the same isozyme. Some\ndrugs, however, are capable of inhibiting reactions for which they are not substrates (for example, ketoconazole),\nleading to drug interactions. Numerous drugs inhibit one or more of the CYP-dependent biotransformation pathways\nof warfarin. For example, omeprazole is a potent inhibitor of three CYP isozymes involved in warfarin metabolism.57\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 58 ---\n\nWhen taken with omeprazole, plasma concentrations of warfarin increase, which leads to greater anticoagulant\neffect and increased risk of bleeding. [Note: The more important CYP inhibitors are erythromycin, ketoconazole,\nand ritonavir, because they each inhibit several CYP isozymes.]\nb.  Phase I reactions not involving the P450 system\nThese include amine oxidation (for example, oxidation of catecholamines or histamine), alcohol dehydrogenation\n(for example, ethanol  oxidation), esterases (for example, metabolism of aspirin in the liver), and hydrolysis (for\nexample, of procaine).\n2.  Phase II\nThis phase consists of conjugation reactions. If the metabolite from phase I is sufficiently polar, it can be excreted\nby the kidneys. However, many phase I metabolites are still too lipophilic to be excreted. A subsequent conjugation\nreaction with an endogenous substrate, such as glucuronic acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid, or an amino acid, results in\npolar, usually more water-soluble compounds that are often therapeutically inactive. A notable exception is\nmorphine-6-glucuronide, which is more potent than morphine. Glucuronidation is the most common and the most\nimportant conjugation reaction. [Note: Drugs already possessing an –OH, –NH2, or –COOH group may enter phase\nII directly and become conjugated without prior phase I metabolism (Figure 1.16).] The highly polar drug\nconjugates are then excreted by the kidney or in bile.\n58\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 59 ---\n\nVI.  Drug Clearance by the Kidney\nDrugs must be sufficiently polar to be eliminated from the body. Removal of drugs from the body occurs via a\nnumber of routes; the most important is elimination through the kidney into the urine. Patients with renal\ndysfunction may be unable to excrete drugs and are at risk for drug accumulation and adverse effects.\n59\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 60 ---\n\nA.  Renal elimination of a drug\nA drug passes through several processes in the kidney before elimination: glomerular filtration, active tubular\nsecretion, and passive tubular reabsorption.\n1.  Glomerular filtration\nDrugs enter the kidney through renal arteries, which divide to form a glomerular capillary plexus. Free drug (not\nbound to albumin) flows through the capillary slits into the Bowman space as part of the glomerular filtrate ( Figure\n1.19). The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is normally about 120 mL/min/1.73m2 but may diminish significantly in\nrenal disease. Lipid solubility and pH do not influence the passage of drugs into the glomerular filtrate. However,\nvariations in GFR and protein binding of drugs do affect this process.\n60\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 61 ---\n\nFigure 1.19 Drug elimination by the kidney.\n2.  Proximal tubular secretion\nDrugs that were not transferred into the glomerular filtrate leave the glomeruli through efferent arterioles, which\ndivide to form a capillary plexus surrounding the nephric lumen in the proximal tubule. Secretion primarily occurs\nin the proximal tubules by two energy-requiring active transport systems: one for anions (for example, deprotonated\n61\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 62 ---\n\nforms of weak acids) and one for cations (for example, protonated forms of weak bases). Each of these transport\nsystems shows low specificity and can transport many compounds. Thus, competition between drugs for these\ncarriers can occur within each transport system. [Note: Premature infants and neonates have an incompletely\ndeveloped tubular secretory mechanism and, thus, may retain certain drugs in the blood.]\n3.  Distal tubular reabsorption\nAs a drug moves toward the distal convoluted tubule, its concentration increases and exceeds that of the perivascular\nspace. The drug, if uncharged, may diffuse out of the nephric lumen, back into the systemic circulation ( Figure\n1.20). Manipulating the urine pH to increase the fraction of ionized drug in the lumen may be done to minimize the\namount of back diffusion and increase the clearance of an undesirable drug. Generally, weak acids can be eliminated\nby alkalinization of the urine, whereas elimination of weak bases may be increased by acidification of the urine. This\nprocess is called “ion trapping.” For example, a patient presenting with phenobarbital  (weak acid) overdose can be\ngiven bicarbonate, which alkalinizes the urine and keeps the drug ionized, thereby decreasing its reabsorption.\n62\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 63 ---\n\nFigure 1.20 Effect of drug metabolism on reabsorption in the distal tubule.\n63\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 64 ---\n\n64\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 65 ---\n\nVII.  Excretion by Other Routes\nDrug excretion may also occur via the intestines, bile, lungs, and breast milk, among others. Drugs that are not\nabsorbed after oral administration or drugs that are secreted directly into the intestines or into bile are excreted in the\nfeces. The lungs are primarily involved in the elimination of anesthetic gases (for example, desflurane). Elimination\nof drugs in breast milk may expose the breast-feeding infant to medications and/or metabolites being taken by the\nmother and is a potential source of undesirable side effects to the infant. Excretion of most drugs into sweat, saliva,\ntears, hair, and skin occurs only to a small extent. Total body clearance and drug half-life are important measures of\ndrug clearance that are used to optimize drug therapy and minimize toxicity.\n65\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 66 ---\n\nA.  Total body clearance\nThe total body (systemic) clearance, CLtotal, is the sum of all clearances from the drug-metabolizing and drug-\neliminating organs. The kidney is often the major organ of excretion. The liver also contributes to drug clearance\nthrough metabolism and/or excretion into the bile. Total clearance is calculated using the following equation:\nwhere CLhepatic  + CLrenal are typically the most important.\n66\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 67 ---\n\nB.  Clinical situations resulting in changes in drug half-life\nWhen a patient has an abnormality that alters the half-life of a drug, adjustment in dosage is required. Patients who\nmay have an increase in drug half-life include those with 1) diminished renal or hepatic blood flow, for example, in\ncardiogenic shock, heart failure, or hemorrhage; 2) decreased ability to extract drug from plasma, for example, in\nrenal disease; and 3) decreased metabolism, for example, when a concomitant drug inhibits metabolism or in hepatic\ninsufficiency, as with cirrhosis. These patients may require a decrease in dosage or less frequent dosing intervals. In\ncontrast, the half-life of a drug may be decreased by increased hepatic blood flow, decreased protein binding, or\nincreased metabolism. This may necessitate higher doses or more frequent dosing intervals.\n67\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 68 ---\n\nVIII.  Design and Optimization of Dosage Regimen\nTo initiate drug therapy, the clinician must select the appropriate route of administration, dosage, and dosing\ninterval. Selection of a regimen depends on various patient and drug factors, including how rapidly therapeutic\nlevels of a drug must be achieved. Therapy may consist of a single dose of a drug, for example, a sleep-inducing\nagent, such as zolpidem. More commonly, drugs are continually administered, either as an IV infusion or in IV or\noral fixed-dose/fixed-time interval regimens (for example, “one tablet every 4 hours”). Continuous or repeated\nadministration results in accumulation of the drug until a steady state occurs. Steady-state concentration is reached\nwhen the rate of drug elimination is equal to the rate of drug administration, such that plasma and tissue levels\nremain relatively constant.\n68\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 69 ---\n\nA.  Continuous infusion regimens\nWith continuous IV infusion, the rate of drug entry into the body is constant. Most drugs exhibit first-order\nelimination, that is, a constant fraction of the drug is cleared per unit of time. Therefore, the rate of drug elimination\nincreases proportionately as the plasma concentration increases.\n1.  Plasma concentration of a drug following continuous IV infusion\nFollowing initiation of a continuous IV infusion, the plasma concentration of a drug rises until a steady state (rate of\ndrug elimination equals rate of drug administration) is reached, at which point the plasma concentration of the drug\nremains constant.\na.  Influence of infusion rate on steady-state concentration\nThe steady-state plasma concentration (Css) is directly proportional to the infusion rate. For example, if the infusion\nrate is doubled, the Css is doubled (Figure 1.21). Furthermore, the Css is inversely proportional to the clearance of\nthe drug. Thus, any factor that decreases clearance, such as liver or kidney disease, increases the Css of an infused\ndrug (assuming Vd remains constant). Factors that increase clearance, such as increased metabolism, decrease the\nCss.\nFigure 1.21 Effect of infusion rate on the steady-state concentration of drug in the\nplasma. Ro = rate of drug infusion; Css = steady-state concentration.\nb.  Time to reach steady-state drug concentration\nThe concentration of a drug rises from zero at the start of the infusion to its ultimate steady-state level, Css (Figure\n1.21). The rate constant for attainment of steady state is the rate constant for total body elimination of the drug.\nThus, 50% of Css of a drug is observed after the time elapsed, since the infusion, t, is equal to t1/2, where t1/2 (or half-\n69\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 70 ---\n\nlife) is the time required for the drug concentration to change by 50%. After another half-life, the drug concentration\napproaches 75% of Css (Figure 1.22). The drug concentration is 87.5% of Css at 3 half-lives and 90% at 3.3 half-\nlives. Thus, a drug reaches steady state in about 4 to 5 half-lives.\nFigure 1.22 Rate of attainment of steady-state concentration of a drug in the plasma after\nintravenous infusion.\nThe sole determinant of the rate that a drug achieves steady state is the half-life (t1/2) of the drug, and this rate is\ninfluenced only by factors that affect half-life. The rate of approach to steady state is not affected by the rate of\ninfusion. When the infusion is stopped, the plasma concentration of a drug declines (washes out) to zero with the\nsame time course observed in approaching steady state (Figure 1.22).\n70\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 71 ---\n\nB.  Fixed-dose/fixed-time regimens\nAdministration of a drug by fixed doses rather than by continuous infusion is often more convenient. However, fixed\ndoses of IV or oral medications given at fixed intervals result in time-dependent fluctuations in the circulating level\nof drug, which contrasts with the smooth ascent of drug concentration with continuous infusion.\n1.  Multiple IV injections\nWhen a drug is given repeatedly at regular intervals, the plasma concentration increases until a steady state is\nreached (Figure 1.23). Because most drugs are given at intervals shorter than 5 half-lives and are eliminated\nexponentially with time, some drug from the first dose remains in the body when the second dose is administered,\nsome from the second dose remains when the third dose is given, and so forth. Therefore, the drug accumulates\nuntil, within the dosing interval, the rate of drug elimination equals the rate of drug administration and a steady state\nis achieved.\nFigure 1.23 Predicted plasma concentrations of a drug given by infusion (A), twice-daily\ninjection (B), or once-daily injection (C). Model assumes rapid mixing in a single body\ncompartment and a half-life of 12 hours.\na.  Effect of dosing frequency\nWith repeated administration at regular intervals, the plasma concentration of a drug oscillates about a mean. Using\nsmaller doses at shorter intervals reduces the amplitude of fluctuations in drug concentration. However, the dosing\nfrequency changes neither the magnitude of Css nor the rate of achieving Css.\nb.  Example of achievement of steady state using different dosage regimens\nCurve B of Figure 1.23 shows the amount of drug in the body when 1 unit of a drug is administered IV and repeated\n71\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 72 ---\n\nat a dosing interval that corresponds to the half-life of the drug. At the end of the first dosing interval, 0.50 units of\ndrug remain from the first dose when the second dose is administered. At the end of the second dosing interval, 0.75\nunits are present when the third dose is given. The minimal amount of drug remaining during the dosing interval\nprogressively approaches a value of 1.00 unit, whereas the maximal value immediately following drug\nadministration progressively approaches 2.00 units. Therefore, at the steady state, 1.00 unit of drug is lost during the\ndosing interval, which is exactly matched by the rate of administration. That is, the “rate in” equals the “rate out.”\nAs in the case for IV infusion, 90% of the steady-state value is achieved in 3.3 half-lives.\n2.  Multiple oral administrations\nMost drugs administered on an outpatient basis are oral medications taken at a specific dose one, two, or more times\ndaily. In contrast to IV injection, orally administered drugs may be absorbed slowly, and the plasma concentration of\nthe drug is influenced by both the rate of absorption and the rate of elimination (Figure 1.24).\nFigure 1.24 Predicted plasma concentrations of a drug given by repeated oral\nadministrations.\n72\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 73 ---\n\n73\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 74 ---\n\nC.  Optimization of dose\nThe goal of drug therapy is to achieve and maintain concentrations within a therapeutic response window while\nminimizing toxicity and/or adverse effects. With careful titration, most drugs can achieve this goal. If the therapeutic\nwindow (see",

Drug\nregimens are administered as a maintenance dose and may require a loading dose if rapid effects are warranted.\n1.  Maintenance dose\nDrugs are generally administered to maintain a Css within the therapeutic window. It takes 4 to 5 half-lives for a\ndrug to achieve Css. To achieve a given concentration, the rate of administration and the rate of elimination of the\ndrug are important. The dosing rate can be determined by knowing the target concentration in plasma (Cp),\nclearance (CL) of the drug from the systemic circulation, and the fraction (F) absorbed (bioavailability):\n2.  Loading dose\nSometimes rapid obtainment of desired plasma levels is needed (for example, in serious infections or arrhythmias).\nTherefore, a “loading dose” of drug is administered to achieve the desired plasma level rapidly, followed by a\nmaintenance dose to maintain the steady state (Figure 1.25). In general, the loading dose can be calculated as\nFigure 1.25 Accumulation of drug administered orally without a loading dose and with a\nsingle oral loading dose administered at t = 0.\nLoading dose = (Vd) × (desired steady-state plasma concentration)/F\nDisadvantages of loading doses include increased risk of drug toxicity and a longer time for the plasma\nconcentration to fall if excess levels occur.\n3.  Dose adjustment\nThe amount of a drug administered for a given condition is estimated based on an “average patient.” This approach\noverlooks interpatient variability in pharmacokinetic parameters such as clearance and Vd, which are quite\nsignificant in some cases. Knowledge of pharmacokinetic principles is useful in adjusting dosages to optimize\n74\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 75 ---\n\ntherapy for a given patient. Monitoring drug therapy and correlating it with clinical benefits provides another tool to\nindividualize therapy.\nFor drugs with a defined therapeutic range, drug concentrations are measured, and the dosage and frequency are\nadjusted to obtain the desired levels. When determining a dosage adjustment, Vd can be used to calculate the amount\nof drug needed to achieve a desired plasma concentration. For example, assume a heart failure patient is not well\ncontrolled due to inadequate plasma levels of digoxin. Suppose the concentration of digoxin in the plasma is C1 and\nthe desired target concentration is C2, a higher concentration. The following calculation can be used to determine\nhow much additional digoxin should be administered to bring the level from C1 to C2.\n(Vd)(C1) = Amount of drug initially in the body\n(Vd)(C2) = Amount of drug in the body needed to achieve the desired plasma concentration\nThe difference between the two values is the additional dosage needed, which equals Vd (C2 − C1).\nFigure 1.26 shows the time course of drug concentration when treatment is started or dosing is changed.\nFigure 1.26 Accumulation of drug following sustained administration and following\nchanges in dosing.

Which\nof the following is likely to be observed with use of Drug X in this patient?\nCorrect answer = D. Because the patient has a renal disorder, she may not be able to excrete the drug effectively.\nTherefore, the half-life of Drug X will be prolonged.

Drug A is\navailable as tablets with an oral bioavailability of 90%.

The F value is 0.9 (because bioavailability is 90%,\nthat is, 90/100 = 0.9). Thus, loading dose = (120 L × 3.0 mg/L)/0.9 = 400 mg.\nA 74-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for treatment of heart failure. He received 160 mcg of\ndigoxin intravenously, and the plasma digoxin level was 0.4 ng/mL.

Overview\nPharmacodynamics describes the actions of a drug on the body. Most drugs exert effects, both beneficial and\nharmful, by interacting with specialized target macromolecules called receptors, which are present on or in the cell.\nThe drug–receptor complex initiates alterations in biochemical and/or molecular activity of a cell by a process called\nsignal transduction (Figure 2.1).\nFigure 2.1 The recognition of a drug by a receptor triggers a biologic response.\n80\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 81 ---\n\n81\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 82 ---\n\nII.  Signal Transduction\nDrugs act as signals, and receptors act as signal detectors. A drug is termed an “agonist” if it binds to a site on a\nreceptor protein and activates it to initiate a series of reactions that ultimately result in a specific intracellular\nresponse. “Second messenger” or effector molecules are part of the cascade of events that translates agonist binding\ninto a cellular response.\n82\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 83 ---\n\nA.  The drug–receptor complex\nCells have many different types of receptors, each of which is specific for a particular agonist and produces a unique\nresponse. Cardiac cell membranes, for example, contain β-adrenergic receptors that bind and respond to epinephrine\nor norepinephrine. Cardiac cells also contain muscarinic receptors that bind and respond to acetylcholine. These two\nreceptor populations dynamically interact to control the heart’s vital functions.\nThe magnitude of the cellular response is proportional to the number of drug–receptor complexes. This concept\nis conceptually similar to the formation of complexes between enzyme and substrate and shares many common\nfeatures, such as specificity of the receptor for a given agonist. Although much of this chapter centers on the\ninteraction of drugs with specific receptors, it is important to know that not all drugs exert effects by interacting with\na receptor. Antacids, for instance, chemically neutralize excess gastric acid, thereby reducing stomach upset.\n83\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 84 ---\n\nB.  Receptor states\nReceptors exist in at least two states, inactive (R) and active (R*), that are in reversible equilibrium with one\nanother, usually favoring the inactive state. Binding of agonists causes the equilibrium to shift from R to R* to\nproduce a biologic effect. Antagonists are drugs that bind to the receptor but do not increase the fraction of R*,\ninstead stabilizing the fraction of R. Some drugs (partial agonists) shift the equilibrium from R to R*, but the\nfraction of R* is less than that caused by an agonist. The magnitude of biological effect is directly related to the\nfraction of R*. In summary, agonists, antagonists, and partial agonists are examples of molecules or ligands that\nbind to the activation site on the receptor and can affect the fraction of R*.\n84\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 85 ---\n\nC.  Major receptor families\nA receptor is defined as any biologic molecule to which a drug binds and produces a measurable response. Thus,\nenzymes, nucleic acids, and structural proteins can act as receptors for drugs or endogenous agonists. However, the\nrichest sources of receptors are membrane-bound proteins that transduce extracellular signals into intracellular\nresponses. These receptors may be divided into four families: 1) ligand-gated ion channels, 2) G protein–coupled\nreceptors, 3) enzyme-linked receptors, and 4) intracellular receptors (Figure 2.2). Generally, hydrophilic ligands\ninteract with receptors that are found on the cell surface ( Figure 2.2A, B, C ). In contrast, hydrophobic ligands enter\ncells through the lipid bilayers of the cell membrane to interact with receptors found inside cells (Figure 2.2D).\nFigure 2.2 Transmembrane signaling mechanisms. A. Ligand binds to the extracellular\ndomain of a ligand-gated channel. B. Ligand binds to a domain of a transmembrane\nreceptor, which is coupled to a G protein. C. Ligand binds to the extracellular domain of\na receptor that activates a kinase enzyme. D. Lipid-soluble ligand diffuses across the\nmembrane to interact with its intracellular receptor. R = inactive protein.\n1.  Transmembrane ligand-gated ion channels\nThe extracellular portion of ligand-gated ion channels contains the drug-binding site. This site regulates the opening\nof the pore through which ions can flow across cell membranes (Figure 2.2A). The channel is usually closed until\nthe receptor is activated by an agonist, which opens the channel for a few milliseconds. Depending on the ion\nconducted through these channels, these receptors mediate diverse functions, including neurotransmission and\nmuscle contraction. For example, stimulation of the nicotinic receptor by acetylcholine opens a channel that allows\nsodium influx and potassium outflux across the cell membranes of neurons or muscle cells. This change in ionic\nconcentrations across the membrane generates an action potential in a neuron and contraction in skeletal and cardiac\nmuscle. On the other hand, agonist stimulation of the A subtype of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor\nincreases chloride influx, resulting in hyperpolarization of neurons and less chance of generating an action potential.\nDrug-binding sites are also found on many voltage-gated ion channels where they can regulate channel function. For\nexample, local anesthetics bind to the voltage-gated sodium channel, inhibiting sodium influx and decreasing\nneuronal conduction.\n2.  Transmembrane G protein–coupled receptors\nThe extracellular portion of this receptor contains the ligand-binding site, and the intracellular portion interacts\n(when activated) with a G protein. There are many kinds of G proteins (for example, Gs, Gi, and Gq), but all types\nare composed of three protein subunits. The α subunit binds guanosine triphosphate (GTP), and the β and γ subunits\nanchor the G protein in the cell membrane (Figure 2.3). Binding of an agonist to the receptor increases GTP binding\nto the α subunit, causing dissociation of the α-GTP complex from the βγ complex. The α and βγ subunits are then\nfree to interact with specific cellular effectors, usually an enzyme or an ion channel, that cause further actions within\nthe cell. These responses usually last several seconds to minutes. Often, the activated effectors produce “second\nmessenger” molecules that further activate other effectors in the cell, causing a signal cascade effect.\n85\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 86 ---\n\n86\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 87 ---\n\nFigure 2.3 The recognition of chemical signals by G protein–coupled membrane\nreceptors affects the activity of adenylyl cyclase. PPi = inorganic pyrophosphate.\nA common effector, activated by Gs and inhibited by Gi, is adenylyl cyclase, which produces the second messenger\ncyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The effector phospholipase C, when activated by Gq, generates two\nsecond messengers: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). DAG and cAMP activate specific\nprotein kinases within the cell, leading to a myriad of physiological effects. IP3 increases intracellular calcium\nconcentration, which in turn activates other protein kinases.\n3.  Enzyme-linked receptors\nThis family of receptors undergoes conformational changes when activated by a ligand, resulting in increased\nintracellular enzyme activity (Figure 2.4). This response lasts for minutes to hours. The most common enzyme-\nlinked receptors (for example, growth factors and insulin) possess tyrosine kinase activity. When activated, the\nreceptor phosphorylates tyrosine residues on itself and other specific proteins ( Figure 2.4). Phosphorylation can\nsubstantially modify the structure of the target protein, thereby acting as a molecular switch. For example, the\nphosphorylated insulin receptor in turn phosphorylates other proteins that now become active. Thus, enzyme-linked\nreceptors often cause a signal cascade effect like that caused by G protein–coupled receptors.\n87\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 88 ---\n\n88\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 89 ---\n\nFigure 2.4 Insulin receptor.\n4.  Intracellular receptors\nThe fourth family of receptors differs considerably from the other three in that the receptor is entirely intracellular,\nand, therefore, the ligand (for example, steroid hormones) must have sufficient lipid solubility to diffuse into the cell\nto interact with the receptor (Figure 2.5). The primary targets of activated intracellular receptors are transcription\nfactors in the cell nucleus that regulate gene expression. The activation or inactivation of transcription factors alters\nthe transcription of DNA into RNA and subsequently translation of RNA into proteins. The effect of drugs or\nendogenous ligands that activate intracellular receptors takes hours to days to occur. Other targets of intracellular\nligands are structural proteins, enzymes, RNA, and ribosomes. For example, tubulin is the target of antineoplastic\nagents such as paclitaxel  (see",

Characteristics of signal transduction\nSignal transduction has two important features: 1) the ability to amplify small signals and 2) mechanisms to protect\nthe cell from excessive stimulation.\n1.  Signal amplification\nA characteristic of G protein–linked and enzyme-linked receptors is the ability to amplify signal intensity and\nduration via the signal cascade effect. Additionally, activated G proteins persist for a longer duration than does the\noriginal agonist–receptor complex. The binding of albuterol , for example, may only exist for a few milliseconds, but\nthe subsequent activated G proteins may last for hundreds of milliseconds. Further prolongation and amplification of\nthe initial signal are mediated by the interaction between G proteins and their respective intracellular targets.\nBecause of this amplification, only a fraction of the total receptors for a specific ligand may need to be occupied to\nelicit a maximal response. Systems that exhibit this behavior are said to have spare receptors. About 99% of insulin\nreceptors are “spare,” providing an immense functional reserve that ensures that adequate amounts of glucose enter\nthe cell. On the other hand, only about 5% to 10% of the total β-adrenoceptors in the heart are spare. Therefore, little\nfunctional reserve exists in the failing heart, because most receptors must be occupied to obtain maximum\ncontractility.\n2.  Desensitization and down-regulation of receptors\nRepeated or continuous administration of an agonist or antagonist often leads to changes in the responsiveness of the\nreceptor. The receptor may become desensitized due to too much agonist stimulation (Figure 2.6), resulting in a\ndiminished response. This phenomenon, called tachyphylaxis, is often due to phosphorylation that renders receptors\nunresponsive to the agonist. In addition, receptors may be internalized within the cell, making them unavailable for\nfurther agonist interaction (down-regulation). Some receptors, particularly ion channels, require a finite time\nfollowing stimulation before they can be activated again. During this recovery phase, unresponsive receptors are\nsaid to be “refractory.” Repeated exposure of a receptor to an antagonist, on the other hand, results in up-regulation\nof receptors, in which receptor reserves are inserted into the membrane, increasing the number of receptors\navailable. Up-regulation of receptors can make cells more sensitive to agonists and/or more resistant to effects of the\nantagonist.\n92\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 93 ---\n\nFigure 2.6 Desensitization of receptors.\n93\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 94 ---\n\nIII.  Dose–Response Relationships\nAgonist drugs mimic the action of the endogenous ligand for the receptor (for example, isoproterenol  mimics\nnorepinephrine on β1 receptors of the heart). The magnitude of the drug effect depends on receptor sensitivity to the\ndrug and the drug concentration at the receptor site, which, in turn, is determined by both the dose of drug\nadministered and by the drug’s pharmacokinetic profile, such as rate of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and\nelimination.\n94\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 95 ---\n\nA.  Graded dose–response relationship\nAs the concentration of a drug increases, its pharmacologic effect also gradually increases until all the receptors are\noccupied (the maximum effect). Plotting the magnitude of response against increasing doses of a drug produces a\ngraded dose–response curve that has the general shape depicted in Figure 2.7A. Two important drug characteristics,\npotency and efficacy, can be determined by graded dose–response curves.\nFigure 2.7 The effect of dose on the magnitude of pharmacologic response. Panel A is a\nlinear plot. Panel B  is a semilogarithmic plot of the same data. EC50 = drug dose causing\n50% of maximal response.\n1.  Potency\nPotency is a measure of the amount of drug necessary to produce an effect. The concentration of drug producing\n50% of the maximum effect (EC50) is often used to determine potency. In Figure 2.7, the EC50 for Drugs A and B\nindicate that Drug A is more potent than Drug B, because a lesser amount of Drug A is needed to obtain 50% effect.\nTherapeutic preparations of drugs reflect their potency. For example, candesartan and irbesartan are angiotensin\nreceptor blockers used to treat hypertension. The therapeutic dose range for candesartan is 4 to 32 mg, as compared\nto 75 to 300 mg for irbesartan. Therefore, candesartan is more potent than irbesartan (it has a lower EC50 value).\nSince the range of drug concentrations that cause from 1% to 99% of maximal response usually spans several orders\nof magnitude, semilogarithmic plots are used to graph the complete range of doses. As shown in Figure 2.7B , the\ncurves become sigmoidal in shape, which simplifies the interpretation of the dose–response curve.\n2.  Efficacy\nEfficacy is the magnitude of response a drug causes when it interacts with a receptor. Efficacy is dependent on the\nnumber of drug–receptor complexes formed and the intrinsic activity of the drug (its ability to activate the receptor\nand cause a cellular response). Maximal efficacy of a drug (Emax) assumes that the drug occupies all receptors, and\nno increase in response is observed in response to higher concentrations of drug. The maximal response differs\nbetween full and partial agonists, even when the drug occupies 100% of the receptors. Similarly, even though an\nantagonist occupies 100% of the receptor sites, no receptor activation results and Emax is zero. Efficacy is a more\nclinically useful characteristic than potency, since a drug with greater efficacy is more therapeutically beneficial than\none that is more potent. Figure 2.8 shows the response to drugs of differing potency and efficacy.\n95\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 96 ---\n\nFigure 2.8 Typical dose–response curve for drugs showing differences in potency and\nefficacy. EC50 = drug dose that shows 50% of maximal response.\n96\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 97 ---\n\nB.  Effect of drug concentration on receptor binding\nThe quantitative relationship between drug concentration and receptor occupancy applies the law of mass action to\nthe kinetics of the binding of drug and receptor molecules:\nBy making the assumption that the binding of one drug molecule does not alter the binding of subsequent molecules\nand applying the law of mass action, we can mathematically express the relationship between the percentage (or\nfraction) of bound receptors and the drug concentration:\n  (1)\nwhere [D] = the concentration of free drug, [DR] = the concentration of bound drug, [Rt] = the total number of\nreceptors, and Kd = the equilibrium dissociation constant for the drug from the receptor. The value of Kd can be used\nto determine the affinity of a drug for its receptor. Affinity describes the strength of the interaction (binding)\nbetween a ligand and its receptor. The higher the Kd value, the weaker the interaction and the lower the affinity, and\nvice versa. Equation (1) defines a curve that has the shapes shown in Figure 2.9 when plotted against drug\nconcentration (Panel A) or log drug concentration (Panel B). As the concentration of free drug increases, the ratio of\nthe concentrations of bound receptors to total receptors approaches unity, thereby producing the maximal effect.\nThus, it is not surprising that the curves shown in Figure 2.9 and those representing the relationship between dose\nand effect (Figure 2.7) are similar.\nFigure 2.9 The effect of dose on the magnitude of drug binding.\n97\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 98 ---\n\n98\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 99 ---\n\nC.  Relationship of drug binding to pharmacologic effect\nThe law of mass action can be applied to drug concentration and response providing the following assumptions are\nmet: 1) The magnitude of the response is proportional to the amount of receptors occupied by drug, 2) the Emax\noccurs when all receptors are bound, and 3) one molecule of drug binds to only one molecule of receptor. In this\ncase,\n  (2)\nwhere [E] = the effect of the drug at concentration [D] and [Emax] = the maximal effect of the drug.\nThus, it follows that if a specific population of receptors is vital for mediating a physiological effect, the affinity\nof an agonist for binding to those receptors should be related to the potency of that drug for causing that\nphysiological effect. Many drugs and most neurotransmitters can bind to more than one type of receptor, thereby\ncausing both desired therapeutic effects and undesired adverse effects. In order to establish a relationship between\ndrug occupation of a particular receptor subtype and the corresponding biological response to that drug, correlation\ncurves of receptor affinity and drug potency are often constructed (Figure 2.10).\nFigure 2.10 Correlation of drug affinity for receptor binding and potency for causing a\nphysiological effect. A positive correlation should exist between the affinity (Kd value) of\na drug for binding to a specific receptor subtype and the potency (EC50 value) of that\ndrug to cause physiological responses mediated by that receptor population. For example,\nmany drugs have affinity for both α1 and β2 adrenergic receptors. The circled letters in\nthe figure represent agonists with varying affinities for α1 and β2 receptors. However,\nfrom the data provided, it becomes clear that α1 receptors only mediate changes in blood\npressure, while β2 receptors only mediate changes in bronchodilation.\n99\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 100 ---\n\nIV.  Intrinsic Activity\nAs mentioned above, an agonist binds to a receptor and produces a biologic response based on the concentration of\nthe agonist, its affinity for the receptor and, hence, the fraction of occupied receptors. However, the intrinsic activity\nof a drug further determines its ability to fully or partially activate the receptors. Drugs may be categorized\naccording to their intrinsic activity and resulting Emax values.\n100\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 101 ---\n\nA.  Full agonists\nIf a drug binds to a receptor and produces a maximal biologic response that mimics the response to the endogenous\nligand, it is a full agonist (Figure 2.11). Full agonists bind to a receptor, stabilizing the receptor in its active state and\nare said to have an intrinsic activity of one. All full agonists for a receptor population should produce the same Emax.\nFor example, phenylephrine is a full agonist at α1-adrenoceptors, because it produces the same Emax as the\nendogenous ligand, norepinephrine. Upon binding to α1-adrenoceptors on vascular smooth muscle, both\nnorepinephrine and phenylephrine stabilize the receptor in its active state, thereby increasing Gq activation.\nActivation of Gq increases intracellular Ca2+, causing interaction of actin and myosin filaments and shortening of the\nmuscle cells. The diameter of the arteriole decreases, causing an increase in resistance to blood flow through the\nvessel and an increase in blood pressure. Thus, effects of agonists on intracellular molecules, cells, tissues, and\nintact organisms are all attributable to interaction of the drug with the receptor. For full agonists, the dose–response\ncurves for receptor binding and each of the biological responses should be comparable.\n101\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 102 ---\n\nFigure 2.11 Effects of full agonists, partial agonists, and inverse agonists on receptor\nactivity.\n102\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 103 ---\n\n103\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 104 ---\n\nB.  Partial agonists\nPartial agonists have intrinsic activities greater than zero but less than one ( Figure 2.11). Even when all the receptors\nare occupied, partial agonists cannot produce the same Emax as a full agonist. Even so, a partial agonist may have an\naffinity that is greater than, less than, or equivalent to that of a full agonist. A partial agonist may also act as a partial\nantagonist of a full agonist (Figure 2.12). As the number of receptors occupied by the partial agonist increases, the\nnumber of receptors that can be occupied by the full agonist decreases and therefore Emax would decrease until it\nreached the Emax of the partial agonist. This potential of partial agonists to act as both an agonist and antagonist may\nhave therapeutic utility. For example, aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic, is a partial agonist at selected\ndopamine receptors. Overactive dopaminergic pathways tend to be inhibited by aripiprazole, whereas underactive\npathways are stimulated. This might explain the ability of aripiprazole to improve symptoms of schizophrenia, with\na small risk of causing extrapyramidal adverse effects (see",

Inverse agonists\nTypically, unbound receptors are inactive and require interaction with an agonist to assume an active conformation.\nHowever, some receptors show a spontaneous conversion from R to R* in the absence of an agonist. Inverse\nagonists, unlike full agonists, stabilize the inactive R form and cause R* to convert to R. This decreases the number\nof activated receptors to below that observed in the absence of drug (Figure 2.11). Thus, inverse agonists have an\nintrinsic activity less than zero, reverse the activation state of receptors, and exert the opposite pharmacological\neffect of agonists.\n107\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 108 ---\n\nD.  Antagonists\nAntagonists bind to a receptor with high affinity but possess zero intrinsic activity. An antagonist has no effect on\nbiological function in the absence of an agonist, but can decrease the effect of an agonist when present. Antagonism\nmay occur either by blocking the drug’s ability to bind to the receptor or by blocking its ability to activate the\nreceptor.\n1.  Competitive antagonists\nIf the antagonist binds to the same site on the receptor as the agonist in a reversible manner, it is “competitive.” A\ncompetitive antagonist interferes with an agonist binding to its receptor and maintains the receptor in its inactive\nstate. For example, the antihypertensive drug terazosin competes with the endogenous ligand norepinephrine at α1-\nadrenoceptors, thus decreasing vascular smooth muscle tone and reducing blood pressure. However, increasing the\nconcentration of agonist relative to antagonist can overcome this inhibition. Thus, competitive antagonists\ncharacteristically shift the agonist dose–response curve to the right (increased EC50) without affecting Emax (Figure\n2.13).\nFigure 2.13 Effects of drug antagonists. EC50 = drug dose that shows 50% of maximal\nresponse.\n2.  Irreversible antagonists\nIrreversible antagonists bind covalently to the active site of the receptor, thereby permanently reducing the number\nof receptors available to the agonist. An irreversible antagonist causes a downward shift of the Emax, with no shift of\nEC50 values (Figure 2.13). In contrast to competitive antagonists, addition of more agonist does not overcome the\neffect of irreversible antagonists. Thus, irreversible antagonists and allosteric antagonists (see below) are both\nconsidered noncompetitive antagonists. A fundamental difference between competitive and noncompetitive\nantagonists is that competitive antagonists reduce agonist potency (increase EC50) and noncompetitive antagonists\nreduce agonist efficacy (decrease Emax).\n3.  Allosteric antagonists\nAn allosteric antagonist binds to a site (allosteric site) other than the agonist-binding site and prevents receptor\nactivation by the agonist. This type of antagonist also causes a downward shift of the Emax of an agonist, with no\n108\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 109 ---\n\nchange in the EC50 value. An example of an allosteric agonist is picrotoxin, which binds to the inside of the GABA-\ncontrolled chloride channel. When picrotoxin binds inside the channel, no chloride can pass through the channel,\neven when GABA fully occupies the receptor.\n4.  Functional antagonism\nAn antagonist may act at a completely separate receptor, initiating effects that are functionally opposite those of the\nagonist. A classic example is the functional antagonism by epinephrine to histamine-induced bronchoconstriction.\nHistamine binds to H1 histamine receptors on bronchial smooth muscle, causing bronchoconstriction of the\nbronchial tree. Epinephrine is an agonist at β2-adrenoceptors on bronchial smooth muscle, which causes the muscles\nto relax. This functional antagonism is also known as “physiologic antagonism.”\n109\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 110 ---\n\nV.  Quantal Dose–Response Relationships\nAnother important dose–response relationship is that between the dose of the drug and the proportion of a\npopulation of patients that responds to it. These responses are known as quantal responses, because, for any\nindividual, either the effect occurs or it does not. Graded responses can be transformed to quantal responses by\ndesignating a predetermined level of the graded response as the point at which a response occurs or not. For\nexample, a quantal dose–response relationship can be determined in a population for the antihypertensive drug\natenolol . A positive response is defined as a fall of at least 5 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure. Quantal dose–\nresponse curves are useful for determining doses to which most of the population responds. They have similar\nshapes as log dose–response curves, and the ED50 is the drug dose that causes a therapeutic response in half of the\npopulation.\n110\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 111 ---\n\nA.  Therapeutic index\nThe therapeutic index (TI) of a drug is the ratio of the dose that produces toxicity in half the population (TD50) to the\ndose that produces a clinically desired or effective response (ED50) in half the population:\nThe TI is a measure of a drug’s safety, because a larger value indicates a wide margin between doses that are\neffective and doses that are toxic.\n111\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 112 ---\n\nB.  Clinical usefulness of the therapeutic index\nThe TI of a drug is determined using drug trials and accumulated clinical experience. These usually reveal a range of\neffective doses and a different (sometimes overlapping) range of toxic doses. Although high TI values are required\nfor most drugs, some drugs with low therapeutic indices are routinely used to treat serious diseases. In these cases,\nthe risk of experiencing adverse effects is not as great as the risk of leaving the disease untreated. Figure 2.14 shows\nthe responses to warfarin, an oral anticoagulant with a low TI, and penicillin, an antimicrobial drug with a large TI.\nFigure 2.14 Cumulative percentage of patients responding to plasma levels of warfarin\nand penicillin.\n112\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 113 ---\n\n1.  Warfarin (example of a drug with a small therapeutic index)\nAs the dose of warfarin is increased, a greater fraction of the patients respond (for this drug, the desired response is\na two- to threefold increase in the international normalized ratio [INR]) until, eventually, all patients respond (Figure\n2.14A). However, at higher doses of warfarin, anticoagulation resulting in hemorrhage occurs in a small percent of\npatients. Agents with a low TI (that is, drugs for which dose is critically important) are those drugs for which\nbioavailability critically alters the therapeutic effects (see",

Penicillin (example of a drug with a large therapeutic index)\nFor drugs such as penicillin (Figure 2.14B ), it is safe and common to give doses in excess of that which is minimally\nrequired to achieve a desired response without the risk of adverse effects. In this case, bioavailability does not\ncritically alter the therapeutic or clinical effects.\n113\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 114 ---\n\n2.1\n2.2\n2.3\n2.4\n2.5\n2.6Study Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nWhich of the following best describes how a drug that acts as an agonist at the A subtype of GABA receptors\naffects signal transduction in a neuron?\nA.  Activation of this receptor subtype alters transcription of DNA in the nucleus of the neuron.\nB.  Activation of this receptor subtype opens ion channels that allow sodium to enter cells and increases the chance\nof generating an action potential.\nC.  Activation of this receptor subtype opens ion channels that allow chloride to enter cells and decreases the chance\nof generating an action potential.\nD.  Activation of this receptor subtype results in G protein activation and increased intracellular second messenger\nlevels.\nCorrect answer = C. The GABA-A receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel selective for chloride. Agonists for the\nGABA-A receptor increase opening of channels, resulting in chloride entry into the neuron, hyperpolarization,\nand decreased action potential events.\nIf 1 mg of lorazepam produces the same anxiolytic response as 10 mg of diazepam, which is correct?\nA.  Lorazepam is more potent than is diazepam.\nB.  Lorazepam is more efficacious than is diazepam.\nC.  Lorazepam is a full agonist, and diazepam is a partial agonist.\nD.  Lorazepam is a better drug to take for anxiety than is diazepam.\nCorrect answer = A. A drug that causes the same effect at a lower dose is more potent. B and C are incorrect\nbecause without information about the maximal effect of these drugs, no conclusions can be made about efficacy\nor intrinsic activity. D is incorrect because the maximal response obtained is often more important than the\namount of drug needed to achieve it.\nIf 10 mg of oxycodone produces a greater analgesic response than does aspirin at any dose, which is correct?\nA.  Oxycodone is more efficacious than is aspirin.\nB.  Oxycodone is less potent than is aspirin.\nC.  Aspirin is a full agonist, and oxycodone is a partial agonist.\nD.  Oxycodone and aspirin act on the same drug target.\nCorrect answer = A. Drugs with greater response at maximally effective concentrations are more efficacious than\ndrugs with a lower maximal response. Choice B is incorrect since no information is given about the half maximal\nconcentrations of either drug. Choices C and D are incorrect since it is not known if both drugs bind to the same\nreceptor population.\nIn the presence of propranolol, a higher concentration of epinephrine is required to elicit full antiasthmatic\nactivity. Propranolol has no effect on asthma symptoms. Which is correct regarding these medications?\nA.  Epinephrine is less efficacious than is propranolol.\nB.  Epinephrine is a full agonist, and propranolol is a partial agonist.\nC.  Epinephrine is an agonist, and propranolol is a competitive antagonist.\nD.  Epinephrine is an agonist, and propranolol is a noncompetitive antagonist.\nCorrect answer = C. Since propranolol decreases the effect of epinephrine but the inhibition can be overcome by\ngiving a higher dose of epinephrine, propranolol must be a competitive antagonist. If D were correct, even very\nhigh concentrations of epinephrine would not be able to elicit a maximal effect in the presence of propranolol.\nSince propranolol has no effect by itself, A and B are incorrect.\nIn the presence of picrotoxin, diazepam is less efficacious at causing sedation, regardless of the dose.\nPicrotoxin has no sedative effect, even at the highest dose. Which of the following is correct regarding these\nagents?\nA.  Picrotoxin is a competitive antagonist.\nB.  Picrotoxin is a noncompetitive antagonist.\nC.  Diazepam is less efficacious than is picrotoxin.\nD.  Diazepam is less potent than is picrotoxin.\nCorrect answer = B. Since picrotoxin decreases the maximal effect of diazepam regardless of the diazepam dose,\nit is a noncompetitive antagonist. Picrotoxin has no efficacy alone, so C is incorrect. No information is provided\nabout potency of either drug.\nHaloperidol, chlorpromazine, and clozapine are antipsychotic medications that bind to the D2 subtype of\ndopamine receptors, with a binding affinity of haloperidol > chlorpromazine > clozapine. Which statement\nwould have to be correct to conclude that the mechanism of antipsychotic effects for these drugs is via\nbinding to D2 receptors?114\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 115 ---\n\n2.7\n2.8\n2.9\n2.10A.  Haloperidol should have the lowest potency of the three antipsychotic drugs.\nB.  D2 receptor binding should also be related to the potency of these drugs in causing Parkinson’s-like adverse\neffects.\nC.  A positive correlation should exist between the affinity of these drugs to bind to D2 receptors and their potency\nfor antipsychotic actions.\nD.  Clozapine would have to be more potent than chlorpromazine for decreasing psychosis.\nCorrect answer = C. To conclude that the mechanism of antipsychotic effect for these drugs is via binding to D2\nreceptors, there should be a positive correlation between the affinity of the drugs for D2 receptors and their\npotency for antipsychotic actions. Haloperidol should have the highest antipsychotic potency and clozapine the\nlowest. There is no guarantee the therapeutic effects and adverse effects are mediated by the same receptor\npopulation; therefore, a different correlation may exist for the adverse effects and D2 receptor affinity.\nIf there were spare β1-adrenergic receptors on cardiac muscle cells, which statement would be correct?\nA.  The number of spare β1-adrenergic receptors determines the size of the maximum effect of the agonist\nepinephrine.\nB.  Spare β1 adrenergic receptors make the cardiac tissue less sensitive to epinephrine.\nC.  A maximal effect of epinephrine is seen when only a portion of β1 adrenergic receptors are occupied.\nD.  Spare receptors are active even in the absence of epinephrine.\nCorrect answer = C. Only a fraction of the total receptors need to be bound to elicit a maximum cellular response\nwhen spare receptors are present. The other choices do not accurately describe the effects of having spare\nreceptors.\nWhich of the following up-regulates postsynaptic α1-adrenergic receptors?\nA.  Daily use of amphetamine that causes release of norepinephrine\nB.  A disease that causes an increase in the activity of norepinephrine neurons\nC.  Daily use of phenylephrine, an α1 receptor agonist\nD.  Daily use of prazosin, an α1 receptor antagonist\nCorrect answer = D. Up-regulation of receptors occurs when receptor activation is lower than normal, such as\nwhen the receptor is continuously exposed to an antagonist for that receptor. Down-regulation of receptors occurs\nwhen receptor activation is greater than normal because of continuous exposure to an agonist, as described in A,\nB, and C.\nMethylphenidate helps patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) maintain attention and\nperform better at school or work, with an ED50 of 10 mg. However, methylphenidate can also cause\nsignificant nausea at higher doses (TD50 = 30 mg). Which is correct regarding methylphenidate?\nA.  The therapeutic index of methylphenidate is 3.\nB.  The therapeutic index of methylphenidate is 0.3.\nC.  Methylphenidate is more potent at causing nausea than treating ADHD.\nD.  Methylphenidate is more efficacious at causing nausea than treating ADHD.\nCorrect answer = A. Therapeutic index is calculated by dividing TD50 by ED50 (30/10), making B incorrect. C is\nincorrect because methylphenidate is more potent at treating ADHD (it takes a lower dose) than causing nausea.\nD. No information about efficacy is provided.\nWhich is correct concerning the safety of using warfarin (with a small therapeutic index) versus penicillin\n(with a large therapeutic index)?\nA.  Warfarin is a safer drug because it has a low therapeutic index.\nB.  Warfarin treatment has a high chance of resulting in dangerous adverse effects if bioavailability is altered.The\nhigh therapeutic index makes penicillin a safe drug for all patients.\nD.  Penicillin treatment has a high chance of causing dangerous adverse effects if bioavailability is altered.\nCorrect answer = B. Agents with a low TI (that is, drugs for which dose is critically important) are those drugs for\nwhich bioavailability critically alters the therapeutic and adverse effects. A is incorrect, because a drug with a low\nTI is not generally considered to be safe. C is incorrect because a high TI does not ensure safety across the entire\npatient population. D is incorrect because the high TI makes it unlikely that bioavailability alters the incidence of\ntherapeutic or adverse effects.115\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 116 ---\n\nUNIT II\nDrugs Affecting the Autonomic Nervous System\n116\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 117 ---\n\n3\nThe Autonomic Nervous System\nRajan Radhakrishnan\n117\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 118 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nThe autonomic nervous system (ANS), along with the endocrine system, coordinates the regulation and integration\nof bodily functions. The endocrine system sends signals to target tissues by varying the levels of blood-borne\nhormones. By contrast, the nervous system exerts effects by the rapid transmission of electrical impulses over nerve\nfibers that terminate at effector cells, which specifically respond to the release of neuromediator substances. Drugs\nthat produce their primary therapeutic effect by mimicking or altering the functions of the ANS are called autonomic\ndrugs and are discussed in the following four chapters. The autonomic agents act either by stimulating portions of\nthe ANS or by blocking the action of the autonomic nerves. This chapter outlines the fundamental physiology of the\nANS and describes the role of neurotransmitters in the communication between extracellular events and chemical\nchanges within the cell.\n118\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 119 ---\n\nI.  Introduction to the Nervous System\nThe nervous system is divided into two anatomical divisions: the central nervous system (CNS), which is composed\nof the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system, which includes neurons located outside the brain\nand spinal cord—that is, any nerves that enter or leave the CNS (Figure 3.1). The peripheral nervous system is\nsubdivided into the efferent and afferent divisions. The efferent neurons carry signals away from the brain and spinal\ncord to the peripheral tissues, and the afferent neurons bring information from the periphery to the CNS. Afferent\nneurons provide sensory input to modulate the function of the efferent division through reflex arcs or neural\npathways that mediate a reflex action.\nFigure 3.1 Organization of the nervous system.\n119\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 120 ---\n\nA.  Functional divisions within the nervous system\nThe efferent portion of the peripheral nervous system is further divided into two major functional subdivisions: the\nsomatic nervous system and the ANS (Figure 3.1). The somatic efferent neurons are involved in the voluntary\ncontrol of functions such as contraction of the skeletal muscles essential for locomotion. The ANS, conversely,\nregulates the everyday requirements of vital bodily functions without the conscious participation of the mind.\nBecause of the involuntary nature of the ANS as well as its functions, it is also known as the visceral, vegetative, or\ninvoluntary nervous system. It is composed of efferent neurons that innervate visceral smooth muscle, cardiac\nmuscle, vasculature, and the exocrine glands, thereby controlling digestion, cardiac output, blood flow, and\nglandular secretions.\n120\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 121 ---\n\nB.  Anatomy of the ANS\n1.  Efferent neurons\nThe ANS carries nerve impulses from the CNS to the effector organs through two types of efferent neurons: the\npreganglionic neurons and the postganglionic neurons ( Figure 3.2). The cell body of the first nerve cell, the\npreganglionic neuron, is located within the CNS. The preganglionic neurons emerge from the brainstem or spinal\ncord and make a synaptic connection in ganglia (an aggregation of nerve cell bodies located in the peripheral\nnervous system). The ganglia function as relay stations between the preganglionic neuron and the second nerve cell,\nthe postganglionic neuron. The cell body of the postganglionic neuron originates in the ganglion. It is generally\nnonmyelinated and terminates on effector organs, such as visceral smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and the exocrine\nglands.\n121\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 122 ---\n\nFigure 3.2 Efferent neurons of the autonomic nervous system.\n2.  Afferent neurons\nThe afferent neurons (fibers) of the ANS are important in the reflex regulation of this system (for example, by\nsensing pressure in the carotid sinus and aortic arch) and in signaling the CNS to influence the efferent branch of the\nsystem to respond.\n3.  Sympathetic neurons\nThe efferent ANS is divided into the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems, as well as the enteric\nnervous system (Figure 3.1). Anatomically, the sympathetic and the parasympathetic neurons originate in the CNS\nand emerge from two different spinal cord regions (Figure 3.3). The preganglionic neurons of the sympathetic122\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 123 ---\n\nsystem come from the thoracic and lumbar regions (T1 to L2) of the spinal cord, and they synapse in two cord-like\nchains of ganglia that run close to and in parallel on each side of the spinal cord. The preganglionic neurons are\nshort in comparison to the postganglionic ones. Axons of the postganglionic neuron extend from the ganglia to\ntissues they innervate and regulate (see",

This arrangement enables activation of numerous effector organs at the same time. [Note:\nThe adrenal medulla, like the sympathetic ganglia, receives preganglionic fibers from the sympathetic system. The\nadrenal medulla, in response to stimulation by the ganglionic neurotransmitter acetylcholine, secretes epinephrine\n(adrenaline), and lesser amounts of norepinephrine, directly into the blood.]\nFigure 3.3 Autonomic nervous system.\n4.  Parasympathetic neurons\nThe parasympathetic preganglionic fibers arise from cranial nerves III (oculomotor), VII (facial), IX\n(glossopharyngeal), and X (vagus), as well as from the sacral region (S2 to S4) of the spinal cord and synapse in\nganglia near or on the effector organs. [Note: The vagus nerve accounts for 90% of preganglionic parasympathetic\nfibers. Postganglionic neurons from this nerve innervate most organs in the thoracic and abdominal cavity.] Thus, in\ncontrast to the sympathetic system, the preganglionic fibers are long, and the postganglionic ones are short, with the\nganglia close to or within the organ innervated. In most instances, there is a one-to-one connection between the\npreganglionic and postganglionic neurons, enabling discrete response of this system.123\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 124 ---\n\n5.  Enteric neurons\nThe enteric nervous system is the third division of the ANS. It is a collection of nerve fibers that innervate the\ngastrointestinal (GI) tract, pancreas, and gallbladder, and it constitutes the “brain of the gut.” This system functions\nindependently of the CNS and controls motility, exocrine and endocrine secretions, and microcirculation of the GI\ntract. It is modulated by both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.\n124\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 125 ---\n\nC.  Functions of the sympathetic nervous system\nAlthough continually active to some degree (for example, in maintaining tone of vascular beds), the sympathetic\ndivision is responsible for adjusting in response to stressful situations, such as trauma, fear, hypoglycemia, cold, and\nexercise (Figure 3.4).\nFigure 3.4 Actions of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems on effector\norgans.\n1.  Effects of stimulation of the sympathetic division\nThe effect of sympathetic stimulation is an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, mobilization of energy stores,\nand increase in blood flow to skeletal muscles and the heart while diverting flow from the skin and internal organs.\nSympathetic stimulation results in dilation of the pupils and bronchioles ( Figure 3.4). It also reduces GI motility and\naffects function of the bladder and sexual organs.\n2.  Fight or flight response\nThe changes experienced by the body during emergencies are referred to as the “fight or flight” response ( Figure\n3.5). These reactions are triggered both by direct sympathetic activation of effector organs and by stimulation of the\nadrenal medulla to release epinephrine and lesser amounts of norepinephrine. Hormones released by the adrenal\nmedulla directly enter the bloodstream and promote responses in effector organs that contain adrenergic receptors\n(see",

The sympathetic nervous system tends to function as a unit and often discharges as a complete\nsystem, for example, during severe exercise or in reactions to fear (Figure 3.5). This system, with its diffuse\ndistribution of postganglionic fibers, is involved in a wide array of physiologic activities. Although it is not essential\nfor survival, it is essential in preparing the body to handle uncertain situations and unexpected stimuli.\n125\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 126 ---\n\n126\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 127 ---\n\nFigure 3.5 Sympathetic and parasympathetic actions are elicited by different stimuli.\n127\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 128 ---\n\nD.  Functions of the parasympathetic nervous system\nThe parasympathetic division is involved with maintaining homeostasis within the body. It is required for life, since\nit maintains essential bodily functions, such as digestion and elimination. The parasympathetic division usually acts\nto oppose or balance the actions of the sympathetic division and generally predominates the sympathetic system in\n“rest-and-digest” situations. Unlike the sympathetic system, the parasympathetic system never discharges as a\ncomplete system. If it did, it would produce massive, undesirable, and unpleasant symptoms, such as involuntary\nurination and defecation. Instead, parasympathetic fibers innervating specific organs such as the gut, heart, or eye\nare activated separately, and the system affects these organs individually.\n128\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 129 ---\n\nE.  Role of the CNS in the control of autonomic functions\nAlthough the ANS is a motor system, it does require sensory input from peripheral structures to provide information\non the current state of the body. This feedback is provided by streams of afferent impulses, originating in the viscera\nand other autonomically innervated structures that travel to integrating centers in the CNS, such as the\nhypothalamus, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord. These centers respond to stimuli by sending out efferent reflex\nimpulses via the ANS.\n1.  Reflex arcs\nMost of the afferent impulses are involuntarily translated into reflex responses. For example, a fall in blood pressure\ncauses pressure-sensitive neurons (baroreceptors in the heart, vena cava, aortic arch, and carotid sinuses) to send\nfewer impulses to cardiovascular centers in the brain. This prompts a reflex response of increased sympathetic\noutput to the heart and vasculature and decreased parasympathetic output to the heart, which results in a\ncompensatory rise in blood pressure and heart rate (Figure 3.6). [Note: In each case, the reflex arcs of the ANS\ncomprise a sensory (afferent) arm and a motor (efferent or effector) arm.]\n129\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 130 ---\n\n130\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 131 ---\n\nFigure 3.6 Baroreceptor reflex arc response to a decrease in blood pressure.\n2.  Emotions and the ANS\nStimuli that evoke strong feelings, such as rage, fear, and pleasure, can modify activities of the ANS.\n131\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 132 ---\n\nF.  Innervation by the ANS\n1.  Dual innervation\nMost organs are innervated by both divisions of the ANS. Thus, vagal parasympathetic innervation slows the heart\nrate, and sympathetic innervation increases heart rate. Despite this dual innervation, one system usually\npredominates in controlling the activity of a given organ. For example, the vagus nerve is the predominant factor for\ncontrolling heart rate. The dual innervation of organs is dynamic, and fine-tuned continually to maintain\nhomeostasis.\n2.  Sympathetic innervation\nAlthough most tissues receive dual innervation, some effector organs, such as the adrenal medulla, kidney,\npilomotor muscles, and sweat glands, receive innervation only from the sympathetic system.\n132\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 133 ---\n\nG.  Somatic nervous system\nThe efferent somatic nervous system differs from the ANS in that a single myelinated motor neuron, originating in\nthe CNS, travels directly to skeletal muscle without the mediation of ganglia. As noted earlier, the somatic nervous\nsystem is under voluntary control, whereas the ANS is involuntary. Responses in the somatic division are generally\nfaster than those in the ANS.\n133\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 134 ---\n\nH.  Summary of differences between sympathetic,\nparasympathetic, and motor nerves\nMajor differences in the anatomical arrangement of neurons lead to variations of the functions in each division\n(Figure 3.7). The sympathetic nervous system is widely distributed, innervating practically all effector systems in\nthe body. By contrast, the distribution of the parasympathetic division is more limited. The sympathetic\npreganglionic fibers have a much broader influence than the parasympathetic fibers and synapse with a larger\nnumber of postganglionic fibers. This type of organization permits a diffuse discharge of the sympathetic nervous\nsystem. The parasympathetic division is more circumscribed, with mostly one-to-one interactions, and the ganglia\nare also close to, or within, organs they innervate. This limits the amount of branching that can be done by this\ndivision. [A notable exception is found in the myenteric plexus (major nerve supply to the GI tract), where one\npreganglionic neuron has been shown to interact with 8000 or more postganglionic fibers.] The anatomical\narrangement of the parasympathetic system results in the distinct functions of this division. The somatic nervous\nsystem innervates skeletal muscles. One somatic motor neuron axon is highly branched, and each branch innervates\na single muscle fiber. Thus, one somatic motor neuron may innervate 100 muscle fibers. This arrangement leads to\nthe formation of a motor unit. The lack of ganglia and the myelination of the motor nerves enable a fast response by\nthe somatic nervous system.\nFigure 3.7 Characteristics of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.\n134\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 135 ---\n\nIII.  Chemical Signaling Between Cells\nNeurotransmission in the ANS is an example of chemical signaling between cells. In addition to neurotransmission,\nother types of chemical signaling include the secretion of hormones and the release of local mediators (Figure 3.8).\nFigure 3.8 Some commonly used mechanisms for transmission of regulatory signals\nbetween cells.\n135\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 136 ---\n\nA.  Hormones\nSpecialized endocrine cells secrete hormones into the bloodstream, where they travel throughout the body, exerting\neffects on broadly distributed target cells (see Chapters 23 through 26).\n136\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 137 ---\n\nB.  Local mediators\nMost cells secrete chemicals that act locally on cells in the immediate environment. Because these chemical signals\nare rapidly destroyed or removed, they do not enter the blood and are not distributed throughout the body. Histamine\n(see",

Neurotransmitters\nCommunication between nerve cells, and between nerve cells and effector organs, occurs through the release of\nspecific chemical signals (neurotransmitters) from the nerve terminals. The release is triggered by arrival of the\naction potential at the nerve ending, leading to depolarization. An increase in intracellular Ca2+ initiates fusion of\nsynaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane and release of their contents. The neurotransmitters rapidly diffuse\nacross the synaptic cleft, or space (synapse), between neurons and combine with specific receptors on the\npostsynaptic (target) cell.\n1.  Membrane receptors\nAll neurotransmitters, and most hormones and local mediators, are too hydrophilic to penetrate the lipid bilayers of\ntarget cell plasma membranes. Instead, their signal is mediated by binding to specific receptors on the cell surface of\ntarget organs. [Note: A receptor is defined as a recognition site for a substance.

Types of neurotransmitters\nAlthough over 50 signal molecules in the nervous system have been identified, norepinephrine (and the closely\nrelated epinephrine), acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin, histamine, glutamate, and γ-aminobutyric acid are most\ncommonly involved in the actions of therapeutically useful drugs. Each of these chemical signals binds to a specific\nfamily of receptors. Acetylcholine and norepinephrine are the primary chemical signals in the ANS, whereas a wide\nvariety of neurotransmitters function in the CNS.\n3.  Acetylcholine\nThe autonomic nerve fibers can be divided into two groups based on the type of neurotransmitter released. If\ntransmission is mediated by acetylcholine, the neuron is termed cholinergic ( Figure 3.9 and Chapters 4 and 5).\nAcetylcholine mediates the transmission of nerve impulses across autonomic ganglia in both the sympathetic and\nparasympathetic nervous systems. It is the neurotransmitter at the adrenal medulla. Transmission from the\nautonomic postganglionic nerves to the effector organs in the parasympathetic system, and a few sympathetic\nsystem organs, also involves the release of acetylcholine. In the somatic nervous system, transmission at the\nneuromuscular junction (the junction of nerve fibers and voluntary muscles) is also cholinergic (Figure 3.9).\nFigure 3.9 Summary of the neurotransmitters released, types of receptors, and types of\nneurons within the autonomic and somatic nervous systems. Cholinergic neurons are\nshown in red and adrenergic neurons in blue. [Note: This schematic diagram does not\nshow that the parasympathetic ganglia are close to or on the surface of the effector organs\nand that the postganglionic fibers are usually shorter than the preganglionic fibers. By\ncontrast, the ganglia of the sympathetic nervous system are close to the spinal cord. The138\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 139 ---\n\npostganglionic fibers are long, allowing extensive branching to innervate more than one\norgan system. This allows the sympathetic nervous system to discharge as a unit.]\n*Epinephrine 80% and norepinephrine 20% released from adrenal medulla.\n4.  Norepinephrine and epinephrine\nWhen norepinephrine is the neurotransmitter, the fiber is termed adrenergic (Figure 3.9 and Chapters 6 and 7). In the\nsympathetic system, norepinephrine mediates the transmission of nerve impulses from autonomic postganglionic\nnerves to effector organs. Epinephrine secreted by the adrenal medulla (not sympathetic neurons) also acts as a\nchemical messenger in the effector organs.

        "content": "Chapter 2). A neurotransmitter can be thought of as a signal and a receptor as a signal detector and\ntransducer. The receptors in the ANS effector cells are classified as adrenergic or cholinergic based on the\nneurotransmitters or hormones that bind to them. Epinephrine and norepinephrine bind to adrenergic receptors, and\nacetylcholine binds to cholinergic receptors. Cholinergic receptors are further classified as nicotinic or muscarinic.\nSome receptors, such as the postsynaptic cholinergic nicotinic receptors in skeletal muscle cells, are directly linked\nto membrane ion channels and are known as ionotropic receptors. Binding of neurotransmitter to ionotropic\nreceptors directly affects ion permeability (Figure 3.10A). All adrenergic receptors and cholinergic muscarinic\nreceptors are G protein–coupled receptors (metabotropic receptors). Metabotropic receptors mediate the effects of\nligands by activating a second messenger system inside the cell. The two most widely recognized second\nmessengers are the adenylyl cyclase system and the calcium/phosphatidylinositol system (Figure 3.10B, C ).\n140\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 141 ---\n\n141\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 142 ---\n\nFigure 3.10 Three mechanisms whereby binding of a neurotransmitter leads to a cellular\neffect.\n142\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 143 ---\n\n3.1\n3.2\n3.3\n3.4\n3.5\n3.6Study Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nWhich is correct regarding the sympathetic nervous system?\nA.  It generally mediates body functions in “rest-and-digest” mode.\nB.  The neurotransmitter at the sympathetic ganglion is norepinephrine (NE).\nC.  The neurotransmitter at the sympathetic ganglion is acetylcholine (ACh).\nD.  Sympathetic neurons release ACh in the effector organs.\nCorrect answer = C. The neurotransmitter at the sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia is acetylcholine. The\nsympathetic system generally mediates body functions in “fight or flight” mode, and the parasympathetic system\ngenerally mediates body functions in “rest-and-digest” mode. Sympathetic neurons release NE, and\nparasympathetic neurons release ACh in the effector cells.\nWhy does the somatic nervous system enable a faster response compared to the ANS?\nA.  Somatic motor neurons have ganglia where neurotransmission is mediated by ACh.\nB.  Somatic motor neurons have ganglia where neurotransmission is mediated by NE.\nC.  Somatic motor neurons are not myelinated.\nD.  Somatic motor neurons are myelinated and do not have ganglia.\nCorrect answer = D. Somatic motor neurons are myelinated and have no ganglia. This enables faster transmission\nin the somatic neurons.\nWhich physiological change occurs when the parasympathetic system is activated?\nA.  Increase in heart rate\nB.  Inhibition of lacrimation (tears)\nC.  Dilation of the pupil (mydriasis)\nD.  Increase in gastric motility\nCorrect answer = D. Activation of the parasympathetic system causes an increase in gastric motility, increase in\nfluid secretions, reduction in heart rate, and constriction of the pupil. In the “rest-and-digest” mode, the\nparasympathetic system is more active, which helps with digestion.\nWhich physiological change is expected when the sympathetic system is inhibited using a pharmacological\nagent?\nA.  Reduction in heart rate\nB.  Increase in blood pressure\nC.  Decrease in fluid secretions\nD.  Constriction of blood vessels\nCorrect answer = A. Activation of the sympathetic system causes an increase in heart rate, increase in blood\npressure, reduction or thickening of fluid secretions, and constriction of blood vessels. Therefore, inhibition of the\nsympathetic system should theoretically cause a reduction in heart rate, decrease in blood pressure, increase in\nfluid secretions, and relaxation of blood vessels.\nWhich is correct regarding activation of receptors on the effector organs in the ANS?\nA.  Acetylcholine activates muscarinic receptors.\nB.  Acetylcholine activates adrenergic receptors.\nC.  Epinephrine activates nicotinic receptors.\nD.  Norepinephrine activates muscarinic receptors.\nCorrect answer = A. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter in the cholinergic system, and it activates both\nmuscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic receptors, not adrenergic receptors. Norepinephrine and epinephrine activate\nadrenergic receptors, not muscarinic receptors.\nWhich statement concerning the parasympathetic nervous system is correct?\nA.  The parasympathetic system often discharges as a single, functional system.\nB.  The parasympathetic division is involved in near vision, movement of food, and urination.\nC.  The postganglionic fibers of the parasympathetic division are long, compared to those of the sympathetic\nnervous system.\nD.  The parasympathetic system controls the secretion of the adrenal medulla.\nCorrect answer = B. The parasympathetic nervous system maintains essential bodily functions, such as vision,\nmovement of food, and urination. It uses acetylcholine, not norepinephrine, as a neurotransmitter, and it\ndischarges as discrete fibers that are activated separately. The postganglionic fibers of the parasympathetic system\nare short compared to those of the sympathetic division. The adrenal medulla is under the control of the\nsympathetic system.143\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 144 ---\n\n3.7\n3.8\n3.9\n3.10Which is correct regarding neurotransmitters and neurotransmission?\nA.  Neurotransmitters are released from the presynaptic nerve terminals.\nB.  Arrival of an action potential in the postsynaptic cell triggers release of neurotransmitter.\nC.  Intracellular calcium levels drop in the neuron before the release of neurotransmitter.\nD.  Serotonin and dopamine are the primary neurotransmitters in the ANS.\nCorrect answer = A. Neurotransmitters are released from presynaptic neurons, triggered by the arrival of an action\npotential in the presynaptic neuron (not in the postsynaptic cell). When an action potential arrives in the\npresynaptic neuron, calcium enters the presynaptic neuron and calcium levels increase in the neuron before\nneurotransmitter is released. The main neurotransmitters in the ANS are norepinephrine and acetylcholine.\nAn elderly man is brought to the emergency room after ingesting a large quantity of prazosin tablets, a drug\nthat blocks α1 adrenergic receptors, which mediate effects of epinephrine and norepinephrine on the blood\nvessels and urinary bladder. Which symptom is most likely to be seen in this patient?\nA.  Reduced heart rate (bradycardia)\nB.  Dilation of blood vessels (vasorelaxation)\nC.  Increased blood pressure\nD.  Reduction in urinary frequency\nCorrect answer = B. Activation of α1 receptors causes vasoconstriction, reduction in urinary frequency, and an\nincrease in blood pressure, without a direct effect on the heart rate. It may cause reflex tachycardia (increase in\nheart rate) in some patients. Thus blockade of α1 receptors could theoretically cause dilation of blood vessels,\nreduction in blood pressure, and increase in urinary frequency. It should not cause a reduction in heart rate.\nWhich statement is correct regarding the autonomic nervous system?\nA.  Afferent neurons carry impulses from the central nervous system (CNS) to the effector organs.\nB.  Preganglionic neurons of the sympathetic system arise from the cranial nerves, as well as from the sacral region.\nC.  When there is a sudden drop in blood pressure, the baroreceptors send signals to the brain to activate the\nparasympathetic system.\nD.  The heart receives both sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation.\nCorrect answer = D. The heart receives both sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation. Activation of\nsympathetic neurons increases the heart rate and force of contraction, and activation of parasympathetic neurons\nreduces the heart rate and force of contraction (slightly). Afferent neurons carry impulses from the periphery to\nthe CNS, and efferent neurons carry signals away from the CNS. Preganglionic neurons of the sympathetic\nsystem arise from thoracic and lumbar regions of the spinal cord, whereas the preganglionic neurons of the\nparasympathetic system arise from cranial nerves and the sacral region. When there is a sudden drop in blood\npressure, the sympathetic system is activated, not the parasympathetic system.\nWhich is correct regarding membrane receptors and signal transduction?\nA.  ANS neurotransmitters bind to membrane receptors on the effector cells, which leads to intracellular events.\nB.  Cholinergic muscarinic receptors are ionotropic receptors.\nC.  Cholinergic nicotinic receptors are metabotropic receptors.\nD.  Metabotropic receptors activate ion channels directly.\nCorrect answer = A. Neurotransmitters generally bind to membrane receptors on the postsynaptic effector cells\nand cause cellular effects. Acetylcholine (ACh) binds to cholinergic muscarinic receptors and activates the second\nmessenger pathway in effector cells, which in turn causes cellular events. Receptors that are coupled to second\nmessenger systems are known as metabotropic receptors. Metabotropic receptors do not directly activate ion\nchannels. ACh also binds to cholinergic nicotinic receptors and activates ion channels on the effector cells. The\nreceptors that directly activate ion channels are known as ionotropic receptors.144\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 145 ---\n\n4\nCholinergic Agonists\nRajan Radhakrishnan\n145\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 146 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nDrugs affecting the autonomic nervous system (ANS) are divided into two groups according to the type of neuron\ninvolved in the mechanism of action. The cholinergic drugs, which are described in this and the following chapter,\nact on receptors activated by acetylcholine (ACh), whereas the adrenergic drugs ( Chapters 6 and 7) act on receptors\nstimulated by norepinephrine or epinephrine. Cholinergic and adrenergic drugs act by either stimulating or blocking\nreceptors of the ANS. Figure 4.1 summarizes cholinergic agonists discussed in this chapter.\nFigure 4.1 Summary of cholinergic agonists.\n146\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 147 ---\n\nII.  The Cholinergic Neuron\nThe preganglionic fibers terminating in the adrenal medulla, the autonomic ganglia (both parasympathetic and\nsympathetic), and the postganglionic fibers of the parasympathetic division use ACh as a neurotransmitter (Figure\n4.2). The postganglionic sympathetic division of sweat glands also uses ACh. In addition, cholinergic neurons\ninnervate the muscles of the somatic system and play an important role in the central nervous system (CNS).\nFigure 4.2 Sites of actions of cholinergic agonists in the autonomic and somatic nervous\nsystems.\n147\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 148 ---\n\nA.  Neurotransmission at cholinergic neurons\nNeurotransmission in cholinergic neurons involves six sequential steps: 1) synthesis of ACh, 2) storage, 3) release,\n4) binding of ACh to the receptor, 5) degradation of ACh in the synaptic cleft (the space between the nerve endings\nand adjacent receptors on nerves or effector organs), and 6) recycling of choline (Figure 4.3).\nFigure 4.3 Synthesis and release of acetylcholine from the cholinergic neuron. AcCoA =\nacetyl coenzyme A.\n1.  Synthesis of acetylcholine\nCholine is transported from the extracellular fluid into the cytoplasm of the cholinergic neuron by an energy-\ndependent carrier system that cotransports sodium and can be inhibited by the drug hemicholinium. [Note: Choline\nhas a quaternary nitrogen and carries a permanent positive charge and, thus, cannot diffuse through the membrane.]\nThe uptake of choline is the rate-limiting step in ACh synthesis. Choline acetyltransferase catalyzes the reaction of\ncholine with acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) to form ACh (an ester) in the cytosol.\n2.  Storage of acetylcholine in vesicles\nACh is packaged and stored into presynaptic vesicles by an active transport process. The mature vesicle contains not\nonly ACh but also adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and proteoglycan. Cotransmission from autonomic neurons is the\nrule rather than the exception. This means that most synaptic vesicles contain the primary neurotransmitter (here,\nACh) as well as a cotransmitter (here, ATP) that increases or decreases the effect of the primary neurotransmitter.\n3.  Release of acetylcholine\nWhen an action potential propagated by voltage-sensitive sodium channels arrives at a nerve ending, voltage-\nsensitive calcium channels on the presynaptic membrane open, causing an increase in the concentration of\nintracellular calcium. Elevated calcium levels promote the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the cell membrane and\nthe release of contents into the synaptic space. This release can be blocked by botulinum toxin. In contrast, the toxin\nin black widow spider venom causes all the ACh stored in synaptic vesicles to empty into the synaptic gap.\n4.  Binding to the receptor\nACh released from the synaptic vesicles diffuses across the synaptic space and binds to postsynaptic receptors on the\ntarget cell, to presynaptic receptors on the membrane of the neuron that released ACh, or to other targeted\npresynaptic receptors. The postsynaptic cholinergic receptors on the surface of effector organs are divided into two\nclasses: muscarinic and nicotinic (Figure 4.2). Binding to a receptor leads to a biologic response within the cell, such\nas the initiation of a nerve impulse in a postganglionic fiber or activation of specific enzymes in effector cells, as148\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 149 ---\n\nmediated by second messenger molecules.\n5.  Degradation of acetylcholine\nThe signal at the postjunctional effector site is rapidly terminated, because acetylcholinesterase (AChE) cleaves ACh\nto choline and acetate in the synaptic cleft.\n6.  Recycling of choline\nCholine may be recaptured by a sodium-coupled, high-affinity uptake system that transports the molecule back into\nthe neuron. There, it is available to be acetylated into ACh.\n149\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 150 ---\n\nIII.  Cholinergic Receptors (Cholinoceptors)\nTwo families of cholinoceptors, designated muscarinic and nicotinic receptors, can be distinguished from each other\non the basis of their different affinities for agents that mimic the action of ACh (cholinomimetic agents).\n150\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 151 ---\n\nA.  Muscarinic receptors\nMuscarinic receptors belong to the class of G-protein–coupled receptors (metabotropic receptors). These receptors,\nin addition to binding ACh, also recognize muscarine, an alkaloid in certain poisonous mushrooms. By contrast, the\nmuscarinic receptors show only a weak affinity for nicotine, an alkaloid found in tobacco and other plants ( Figure\n4.4A). There are five subclasses of muscarinic receptors; however, only M1, M2, and M3 receptors have been\nfunctionally characterized.\nFigure 4.4 Types of cholinergic receptors.\n1.  Location of muscarinic receptors\nThese receptors are found on the autonomic effector organs, such as the heart, smooth muscle, brain, and exocrine\n151\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 152 ---\n\nglands. Although all five subtypes are found on neurons, M1 receptors are also found on gastric parietal cells, M2\nreceptors on cardiac cells and smooth muscle, and M3 receptors on the bladder, exocrine glands, and smooth muscle.\n[Note: Drugs with muscarinic actions preferentially stimulate muscarinic receptors on these tissues, but at high\nconcentration, they may show some activity at nicotinic receptors.]\n2.  Mechanism of acetylcholine signal transduction\nA number of different molecular mechanisms transmit the signal generated by ACh occupation of the receptor. For\nexample, when M1 or M3 receptors are activated, the receptor undergoes a conformational change and interacts with\na G-protein that activates phospholipase C. This ultimately leads to production of second messengers inositol-1,4,5-\ntrisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 causes an increase in intracellular Ca2+. Calcium can then interact\nto stimulate or inhibit enzymes or to cause hyperpolarization, secretion, or contraction. DAG activates protein kinase\nC, an enzyme that phosphorylates numerous proteins within the cell. In contrast, activation of the M2 subtype on the\ncardiac muscle stimulates a G-protein that inhibits adenylyl cyclase and increases K+ conductance. The heart\nresponds with a decrease in rate and force of contraction.\n3.  Muscarinic agonists\nPilocarpine is a nonselective muscarinic agonist used to treat xerostomia and glaucoma. Attempts are currently\nunderway to develop muscarinic agents that are directed against specific receptor subtypes.\n152\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 153 ---\n\nB.  Nicotinic receptors\nThese receptors, in addition to binding ACh, also recognize nicotine but show only a weak affinity for muscarine\n(Figure 4.4B ). The nicotinic receptor is composed of five subunits, and it functions as a ligand-gated ion channel\n(ionotropic receptor). Binding of two ACh molecules elicits a conformational change that allows the entry of sodium\nions, resulting in the depolarization of the effector cell. Nicotine at low concentration stimulates the receptor,\nwhereas nicotine at high concentration blocks the receptor. Nicotinic receptors are located in the CNS, the adrenal\nmedulla, autonomic ganglia, and the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in skeletal muscles. Those at the NMJ are\nsometimes designated NM, and the others, NN. The nicotinic receptors of autonomic ganglia differ from those of the\nNMJ. For example, ganglionic receptors are selectively blocked by mecamylamine, whereas NMJ receptors are\nspecifically blocked by atracurium.\n153\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 154 ---\n\nIV.  Direct-Acting Cholinergic Agonists\nCholinergic agonists mimic the effects of ACh by binding directly to cholinoceptors (muscarinic or nicotinic). These\nagents may be broadly classified into two groups: 1) choline esters, which include endogenous ACh and synthetic\nesters of choline, such as carbachol  and bethanechol , and 2) naturally occurring alkaloids, such as nicotine and\npilocarpine (Figure 4.5). All direct-acting cholinergic drugs have a longer duration of action than ACh. The more\ntherapeutically useful drugs (pilocarpine and bethanechol ) preferentially bind to muscarinic receptors and are\nsometimes referred to as muscarinic agents. However, as a group, the direct-acting agonists show little specificity in\ntheir actions, which limits clinical usefulness.\n154\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 155 ---\n\n155\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 156 ---\n\nFigure 4.5 Comparison of the structures of some cholinergic agonists.\n156\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 157 ---\n\nA.  Acetylcholine\nAcetylcholine [ah-see-teel-KOE-leen] is a quaternary ammonium compound that cannot penetrate membranes.\nAlthough it is the neurotransmitter of parasympathetic and somatic nerves as well as autonomic ganglia, it lacks\ntherapeutic importance because of its multiplicity of actions (leading to diffuse effects) and its rapid inactivation by\nthe cholinesterases. ACh has both muscarinic and nicotinic activity. Its actions include the following:\n1.  Decrease in heart rate and cardiac output\nThe actions of ACh on the heart mimic the effects of vagal stimulation. For example, if injected intravenously, ACh\nproduces a brief decrease in cardiac rate (bradycardia) and cardiac output, mainly because of a reduction in the rate\nof firing at the sinoatrial (SA) node. [Note: Normal vagal activity regulates the heart by the release of ACh at the SA\nnode.]\n2.  Decrease in blood pressure\nInjection of ACh causes vasodilation and lowering of blood pressure by an indirect mechanism of action. ACh\nactivates M3 receptors found on endothelial cells lining the smooth muscles of blood vessels. This results in the\nproduction of nitric oxide from arginine. Nitric oxide then diffuses to vascular smooth muscle cells to stimulate\nprotein kinase G production, leading to hyperpolarization and smooth muscle relaxation via phosphodiesterase-3\ninhibition. In the absence of administered cholinergic agents, the vascular cholinergic receptors have no known\nfunction, because ACh is never released into the blood in significant quantities. Atropine blocks these muscarinic\nreceptors and prevents ACh from producing vasodilation.\n3.  Other actions\nIn the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, acetylcholine increases salivary secretion, increases gastric acid secretion, and\nstimulates intestinal secretions and motility. It also enhances bronchiolar secretions and causes bronchoconstriction.\n[Note: Methacholine, a direct-acting cholinergic agonist, is used to assist in the diagnosis of asthma due to its\nbronchoconstricting properties.] In the genitourinary tract, ACh increases the tone of the detrusor muscle, causing\nurination. In the eye, ACh is involved in stimulation of ciliary muscle contraction for near vision and in the\nconstriction of the pupillae sphincter muscle, causing miosis (marked constriction of the pupil). ACh (1% solution)\nis instilled into the anterior chamber of the eye to produce miosis during ophthalmic surgery.\n157\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 158 ---\n\nB.  Bethanechol\nBethanechol  [be-THAN-e-kole] is an unsubstituted carbamoyl ester, structurally related to ACh ( Figure 4.5). It is\nnot hydrolyzed by AChE due to the esterification of carbamic acid, although it is inactivated through hydrolysis by\nother esterases. It lacks nicotinic actions (due to addition of the methyl group), but does have strong muscarinic\nactivity. Its major actions are on the smooth musculature of the bladder and GI tract. It has about a 1-hour duration\nof action.\n1.  Actions\nBethanechol  directly stimulates muscarinic receptors, causing increased intestinal motility and tone. It also\nstimulates the detrusor muscle of the bladder, whereas the trigone and sphincter muscles are relaxed. These effects\nstimulate urination.\n2.  Therapeutic uses\nIn urologic treatment, bethanechol  is used to stimulate the atonic bladder, particularly in postpartum or\npostoperative, nonobstructive urinary retention. Bethanechol  may also be used to treat neurogenic atony as well as\nmegacolon.\n3.  Adverse effects\nBethanechol  can cause generalized cholinergic stimulation (Figure 4.6), with sweating, salivation, flushing,\ndecreased blood pressure (with reflex tachycardia), nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bronchospasm. Atropine\nsulfate may be administered to overcome severe cardiovascular or bronchoconstrictor responses to this agent.\n158\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 159 ---\n\nFigure 4.6 Some adverse effects observed with cholinergic agonists.\n159\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 160 ---\n\n160\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 161 ---\n\nC.  Carbachol (carbamylcholine)\nCarbachol  [KAR-ba-kole] has both muscarinic and nicotinic actions. Like bethanechol , carbachol  is an ester of\ncarbamic acid (Figure 4.5) and a poor substrate for AChE. It is biotransformed by other esterases, but at a much\nslower rate.\n1.  Actions\nCarbachol  has profound effects on both the cardiovascular and GI systems because of its ganglion-stimulating\nactivity, and it may first stimulate and then depress these systems. It can cause release of epinephrine from the\nadrenal medulla by its nicotinic action. Locally instilled into the eye, it mimics the effects of ACh, causing miosis\nand a spasm of accommodation in which the ciliary muscle of the eye remains in a constant state of contraction. The\nvision becomes fixed at some particular distance, making it impossible to focus (Figure 4.7). [Note the opposing\neffects of atropine, a muscarinic blocker, on the eye.]\nFigure 4.7 Actions of pilocarpine, carbachol, and atropine on the iris and ciliary muscle\nof the eye.\n161\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 162 ---\n\n2.  Therapeutic uses\nBecause of its high potency, receptor nonselectivity, and relatively long duration of action, carbachol  is rarely used.\nIntraocular use provides miosis for eye surgery and lowers intraocular pressure in the treatment of glaucoma.\n3.  Adverse effects\nWith ophthalmologic use, few adverse effects occur due to lack of systemic penetration (quaternary amine).\n162\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 163 ---\n\nD.  Pilocarpine\nThe alkaloid pilocarpine [pye-loe-KAR-peen] is a tertiary amine and is stable to hydrolysis by AChE (Figure 4.5).\nCompared with ACh and its derivatives, it is far less potent but is uncharged and can penetrate the CNS at\ntherapeutic doses. Pilocarpine exhibits muscarinic activity and is used primarily in ophthalmology.\n1.  Actions\nApplied topically to the eye, pilocarpine produces rapid miosis, contraction of the ciliary muscle, and spasm of\naccommodation. Pilocarpine is one of the most potent stimulators of secretions such as sweat, tears, and saliva, but\nits use for producing these effects has been limited due to its lack of selectivity.\n2.  Therapeutic uses\nPilocarpine is used to treat glaucoma and is the drug of choice for emergency lowering of intraocular pressure of\nboth open-angle and angle-closure glaucoma. Pilocarpine is extremely effective in opening the trabecular meshwork\naround the Schlemm canal, causing an immediate drop in intraocular pressure because of the increased drainage of\naqueous humor. This action occurs within a few minutes, lasts 4 to 8 hours, and can be repeated. [Note: Topical\ncarbonic anhydrase inhibitors, such as dorzolamide and β-adrenergic blockers such as timolol , are effective in\ntreating glaucoma but are not used for emergency lowering of intraocular pressure.] The miotic action of pilocarpine\nis also useful in reversing mydriasis due to atropine.\nThe drug is beneficial in promoting salivation in patients with xerostomia resulting from irradiation of the head\nand neck. Sjögren syndrome, which is characterized by dry mouth and lack of tears, is treated with oral pilocarpine\ntablets and cevimeline, a cholinergic drug that also has the drawback of being nonspecific.\n3.  Adverse effects\nPilocarpine can cause blurred vision, night blindness, and brow ache. Poisoning with this agent is characterized by\nexaggeration of various parasympathetic effects, including profuse sweating (diaphoresis) and salivation. The effects\nare similar to those produced by consumption of mushrooms of the genus Inocybe, which contain muscarine.\nParenteral atropine, at doses that can cross the blood–brain barrier, is administered to counteract the toxicity of\npilocarpine.\n163\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 164 ---\n\nV.  Indirect-Acting Cholinergic Agonists: Anticholinesterase\nAgents (Reversible)\nAChE is an enzyme that specifically cleaves ACh to acetate and choline and, thus, terminates its actions. It is located\nboth pre- and postsynaptically in the nerve terminal where it is membrane bound. Inhibitors of AChE\n(anticholinesterase agents or cholinesterase inhibitors) indirectly provide cholinergic action by preventing the\ndegradation of ACh. This results in an accumulation of ACh in the synaptic space (Figure 4.8). Therefore, these\ndrugs can provoke a response at all cholinoceptors, including both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors of the ANS, as\nwell as at the NMJ and in the brain. The reversible AChE inhibitors can be broadly classified as short-acting or\nintermediate-acting agents.\nFigure 4.8 Mechanisms of action of indirect cholinergic agonists. AChE =\nacetylcholinesterase.\n164\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 165 ---\n\nA.  Edrophonium\nEdrophonium [ed-row-FOE-nee-um] is the prototype short-acting AChE inhibitor. Edrophonium binds reversibly to\nthe active center of AChE, preventing hydrolysis of ACh. It has a short duration of action of 10 to 20 minutes due to\nrapid renal elimination. Edrophonium is a quaternary amine, and its actions are limited to the periphery. It is used in\nthe diagnosis of myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disease caused by antibodies to the nicotinic receptor at the\nNMJ. This causes the degradation of the nicotinic receptors, making fewer receptors available for interaction with\nACh. Intravenous injection of edrophonium leads to a rapid increase in muscle strength in patients with myasthenia\ngravis. Care must be taken, because excess drug may provoke a cholinergic crisis ( atropine is the antidote).\nEdrophonium may also be used to assess cholinesterase inhibitor therapy, for differentiating cholinergic and\nmyasthenic crises, and for reversing the effects of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers (NMBs) after surgery.\nDue to the availability of other agents, edrophonium use has become limited.\n165\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 166 ---\n\nB.  Physostigmine\nPhysostigmine [fi-zoe-STIG-meen] is a nitrogenous carbamic acid ester found naturally in plants and is a tertiary\namine. It is a substrate for AChE, and it forms a relatively stable carbamoylated intermediate with the enzyme,\nwhich then becomes reversibly inactivated. The result is potentiation of cholinergic activity throughout the body.\n1.  Actions\nPhysostigmine has a wide range of effects and stimulates not only the muscarinic and nicotinic sites of the ANS, but\nalso the nicotinic receptors of the NMJ. Muscarinic stimulation can cause contraction of GI smooth muscles, miosis,\nbradycardia, and hypotension (Figure 4.9). Nicotinic stimulation can cause skeletal muscle twitches, fasciculations,\nand skeletal muscle paralysis (at higher doses). Its duration of action is about 30 minutes to 2 hours, and it is\nconsidered an intermediate-acting agent. Physostigmine can enter and stimulate the cholinergic sites in the CNS.\nFigure 4.9 Some actions of physostigmine.\n166\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 167 ---\n\n2.  Therapeutic uses\nPhysostigmine is used in the treatment of overdoses of drugs with anticholinergic actions, such as atropine, and to\nreverse the effects of NMBs.\n3.  Adverse effects\nHigh doses of physostigmine may lead to convulsions. Bradycardia and a fall in cardiac output may also occur.\nInhibition of AChE at the NMJ causes the accumulation of ACh and, ultimately through continuous depolarization,\nresults in paralysis of skeletal muscle. However, these effects are rarely seen with therapeutic doses.\n167\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 168 ---\n\nC.  Neostigmine\nNeostigmine [nee-oh-STIG-meen] is a synthetic compound that is also a carbamic acid ester, and it reversibly\ninhibits AChE in a manner similar to physostigmine.\n1.  Actions\nUnlike physostigmine, neostigmine has a quaternary nitrogen. Therefore, it is more polar, is absorbed poorly from\nthe GI tract, and does not enter the CNS. Its effect on skeletal muscle is greater than physostigmine, and it can\nstimulate contractility before it paralyzes. Neostigmine has an intermediate duration of action, usually 30 minutes to\n2 hours.\n2.  Therapeutic uses\nIt is used to stimulate the bladder and GI tract and as an antidote for competitive neuromuscular-blocking agents.\nNeostigmine is also used to manage symptoms of myasthenia gravis.\n3.  Adverse effects\nAdverse effects of neostigmine include those of generalized cholinergic stimulation, such as salivation, flushing,\ndecreased blood pressure, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bronchospasm. Neostigmine does not cause CNS\nside effects and is not used to overcome toxicity of central-acting antimuscarinic agents such as atropine.\nNeostigmine is contraindicated when intestinal or urinary bladder obstruction is present.\n168\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 169 ---\n\nD.  Pyridostigmine\nPyridostigmine [peer-id-oh-STIG-meen] is another cholinesterase inhibitor used in the chronic management of\nmyasthenia gravis. Its duration of action is intermediate (3 to 6 hours) but longer than that of neostigmine. Adverse\neffects are similar to those of neostigmine.\n169\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 170 ---\n\nE.  Tacrine, donepezil , rivastigmine, and galantamine\nPatients with Alzheimer disease have a deficiency of cholinergic neurons and therefore lower levels of ACh in the\nCNS. This observation led to the development of anticholinesterases as possible remedies for the loss of cognitive\nfunction. Tacrine [TAK-reen], the first agent in this category, has been replaced by others because of its\nhepatotoxicity. Despite the ability of donepezil  [doe-NEP-e-zil], rivastigmine [ri-va-STIG-meen], and galantamine\n[ga-LAN-ta-meen] to delay the progression of Alzheimer disease, none can stop its progression. GI distress is their\nprimary adverse effect (see",

Indirect-Acting Cholinergic Agonists: Anticholinesterase\nAgents (Irreversible)\nA number of synthetic organophosphate compounds have the ability to bind covalently to AChE. The result is a\nlong-lasting increase in ACh at all sites where it is released. Many of these drugs are extremely toxic and were\ndeveloped by the military as nerve agents. Related compounds, such as parathion and malathion, are used as\ninsecticides.\n171\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 172 ---\n\nA.  Echothiophate\n1.  Mechanism of action\nEchothiophate [ek-oe-THI-oh-fate] is an organophosphate that covalently binds via its phosphate group at the active\nsite of AChE (Figure 4.10). Once this occurs, the enzyme is permanently inactivated, and restoration of AChE\nactivity requires the synthesis of new enzyme molecules. Following covalent modification of AChE, the\nphosphorylated enzyme slowly releases one of its ethyl groups. The loss of an alkyl group, which is called aging,\nmakes it impossible for chemical reactivators, such as pralidoxime, to break the bond between the remaining drug\nand the enzyme.\n172\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 173 ---\n\n173\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 174 ---\n\nFigure 4.10 Covalent modification of acetylcholinesterase by echothiophate. Also shown\nis the reactivation of the enzyme with pralidoxime (2-PAM). R = (CH3)3N+–CH2–CH2–;\nRSH = (CH3)3N+–CH2–CH2–S-H.\n2.  Actions\nActions include generalized cholinergic stimulation, paralysis of motor function (causing breathing difficulties), and\nconvulsions. Echothiophate produces intense miosis and, thus, has found therapeutic use. Intraocular pressure falls\nfrom the facilitation of outflow of aqueous humor. Atropine in high dosages can reverse many of the peripheral and\nsome of the central muscarinic effects of echothiophate.\n3.  Therapeutic uses\nA topical ophthalmic solution of the drug is available for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma. However,\nechothiophate is rarely used due to its side effect profile, which includes the risk of cataracts. Figure 4.11\nsummarizes actions of some cholinergic agonists.\nFigure 4.11 Summary of actions of some cholinergic agonists. CNS = central nervous\nsystem.\n174\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 175 ---\n\nVII.  Toxicology of Anticholinesterase Agents\nIrreversible AChE inhibitors (mostly organophosphate compounds) are commonly used as agricultural insecticides\nin the United States, which has led to numerous cases of accidental poisoning with these agents. In addition, they are\nfrequently used for suicidal and homicidal purposes. Organophosphate nerve gases such as sarin are used as agents\nof warfare and chemical terrorism. Toxicity with these agents is manifested as nicotinic and muscarinic signs and\nsymptoms (cholinergic crisis). Depending on the agent, the effects can be peripheral or can affect the whole body.\n175\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 176 ---\n\nA.  Reactivation of acetylcholinesterase\nPralidoxime [pral-i-DOX-eem] (2-PAM) can reactivate inhibited AChE (Figure 4.10). However, it is unable to\npenetrate into the CNS and therefore is not useful in treating the CNS effects of organophosphates. The presence of\na charged group allows it to approach an anionic site on the enzyme, where it essentially displaces the phosphate\ngroup of the organophosphate and regenerates the enzyme. If given before aging of the alkylated enzyme occurs, it\ncan reverse both muscarinic and nicotinic peripheral effects of organophosphates, but not the CNS effects. With the\nnewer nerve agents that produce aging of the enzyme complex within seconds, pralidoxime is less effective. In\naddition, it cannot overcome toxicity of reversible AChE inhibitors (for example, physostigmine).\n176\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 177 ---\n\nB.  Other treatments\nAtropine is administered to prevent muscarinic side effects of these agents. Such effects include increased bronchial\nand salivary secretion, bronchoconstriction, and bradycardia. Diazepam is also administered to reduce the persistent\nconvulsion caused by these agents. General supportive measures, such as maintenance of patent airway, oxygen\nsupply, and artificial respiration, may be necessary as well.\n177\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 178 ---\n\n4.1\n4.2\n4.3\n4.4\n4.5Study Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nBotulinum toxin blocks the release of acetylcholine from cholinergic nerve terminals. Which is a possible\neffect of botulinum toxin?\nA.  Skeletal muscle paralysis\nB.  Improvement of myasthenia gravis symptoms\nC.  Increased salivation\nD.  Reduced heart rate\nCorrect answer = A. Acetylcholine released by cholinergic neurons acts on nicotinic receptors in the skeletal\nmuscle cells to cause contraction. Therefore, blockade of ACh release causes skeletal muscle paralysis.\nMyasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease where antibodies are produced against nicotinic receptors and\ninactivate nicotinic receptors. A reduction in ACh release therefore worsens (not improves) the symptoms of this\ncondition. Reduction in ACh release by botulinum toxin causes reduction in secretions including saliva (not\nincrease in salivation), causing dry mouth and an increase (not reduction) in heart rate due to reduced vagal\nactivity.\nA patient develops urinary retention after an abdominal surgery. Urinary obstruction was ruled out in this\npatient. Which strategy would be helpful in promoting urination?\nA.  Activating nicotinic receptors\nB.  Inhibiting the release of acetylcholine\nC.  Inhibiting cholinesterase enzyme\nD.  Blocking muscarinic receptors\nCorrect answer = C. Activation of muscarinic receptors in the detrusor muscle of the urinary bladder can promote\nurination in patients where the tone of detrusor muscle is low. Inhibiting cholinesterase enzyme increases the\nlevels of acetylcholine, and acetylcholine can increase the tone of the detrusor muscle. There are no nicotinic\nreceptors in the detrusor muscle; therefore, activation of nicotinic receptors is not helpful. Inhibiting the release of\nacetylcholine or blocking muscarinic receptors worsens urinary retention.\nWhich of the following drugs could theoretically improve asthma symptoms?\nA.  Bethanechol\nB.  Pilocarpine\nC.  Pyridostigmine\nD.  Atropine\nCorrect answer = D. Muscarinic agonists and drugs that increase acetylcholine levels cause constriction of\nbronchial smooth muscles and could exacerbate asthma symptoms. Bethanechol and pilocarpine are muscarinic\nagonists, and pyridostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor that increases levels of acetylcholine. Atropine is a\nmuscarinic antagonist and therefore does not exacerbate asthma. Theoretically, it should relieve symptoms of\nasthma (not used clinically for this purpose).\nIf an ophthalmologist wants to dilate the pupils for an eye examination, which drug/class of drugs is\ntheoretically useful?\nA.  Muscarinic receptor activator (agonist)\nB.  Muscarinic receptor inhibitor (antagonist)\nC.  Pilocarpine\nD.  Neostigmine\nCorrect answer = B. Muscarinic agonists (for example, pilocarpine) contract the circular smooth muscles in the\niris sphincter and constrict the pupil (miosis). Anticholinesterases (for example, neostigmine, physostigmine) also\ncause miosis by increasing the level of ACh. Muscarinic antagonists, on the other hand, relax the circular smooth\nmuscles in the iris sphincter and cause dilation of the pupil (mydriasis).\nIn Alzheimer disease, there is a deficiency of cholinergic neuronal function in the brain. Theoretically, which\nstrategy is useful in treating symptoms of Alzheimer disease?\nA.  Inhibiting cholinergic receptors in the brain\nB.  Inhibiting the release of acetylcholine in the brain\nC.  Inhibiting the acetylcholinesterase enzyme in the brain\nD.  Activating the acetylcholinesterase enzyme in the brain\nCorrect answer = C. Because there is already a deficiency in brain cholinergic function in Alzheimer disease,\ninhibiting cholinergic receptors or inhibiting the release of ACh worsens the condition. Activating the\nacetylcholinesterase enzyme increases the degradation of ACh, which also worsens the condition. However,\ninhibiting the acetylcholinesterase enzyme helps to increase the levels of ACh in the brain and thereby relieve the\nsymptoms of Alzheimer disease.178\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 179 ---\n\n4.6\n4.7\n4.8\n4.9\n4.10An elderly female who lives in a farmhouse was brought to the emergency room in serious condition after\ningesting a liquid from an unlabeled bottle found near her bed, apparently in a suicide attempt. She presented\nwith diarrhea, frequent urination, convulsions, breathing difficulties, constricted pupils (miosis), and\nexcessive salivation. Which of the following is correct regarding this patient?\nA.  She most likely consumed an organophosphate pesticide.\nB.  The symptoms are consistent with sympathetic activation.\nC.  Her symptoms can be treated using an anticholinesterase agent.\nD.  Her symptoms can be treated using a cholinergic agonist.\nCorrect answer = A. The symptoms are consistent with that of cholinergic crisis. Since the elderly female lives on\na farm and the symptoms are consistent with a cholinergic crisis (usually caused by cholinesterase inhibitors), it\nmay be assumed that she has consumed an organophosphate pesticide (irreversible cholinesterase inhibitor).\nAssuming that the symptoms are caused by organophosphate poisoning, administering an anticholinesterase agent\nor a cholinergic agonist will worsen the condition. The symptoms are not consistent with that of sympathetic\nactivation, as sympathetic activation will cause symptoms opposite to that of cholinergic crisis seen in this\npatient.\nA patient who received a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocker (NMB) for skeletal muscle relaxation\nduring surgery is experiencing mild skeletal muscle paralysis after the surgery. Which drug could reverse\nthis effect of NMBs?\nA.  Pilocarpine\nB.  Bethanechol\nC.  Neostigmine\nD.  Atropine\nCorrect answer = C. Neuromuscular blockers act by blocking nicotinic receptors on the skeletal muscles.\nIncreasing the levels of ACh in the neuromuscular junctions can reverse the effects of NMBs. Therefore,\nneostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, could reverse the effects of NMBs. Pilocarpine and bethanechol are\npreferentially muscarinic agonists and have no effects on the nicotinic receptors. Atropine is a muscarinic\nantagonist and has no effects on nicotinic receptors.\nA 60-year-old female who had a cancerous growth in the neck region underwent radiation therapy. Her\nsalivary secretion was reduced due to radiation and she suffers from dry mouth (xerostomia). Which drug\nwould be most useful in treating xerostomia in this patient?\nA.  Acetylcholine\nB.  Pilocarpine\nC.  Echothiophate\nD.  Atropine\nCorrect answer = B. Salivary secretion may be enhanced by activating muscarinic receptors in the salivary glands.\nThis can be achieved in theory by using a muscarinic agonist or an anticholinesterase agent. Pilocarpine is a\nmuscarinic agonist administered orally for this purpose. Acetylcholine has similar effects as that of pilocarpine;\nhowever, it cannot be used therapeutically as it is rapidly destroyed by cholinesterase in the body. Echothiophate\nis an irreversible cholinesterase inhibitor, but it cannot be used therapeutically because of its toxic effects.\nAtropine is a muscarinic antagonist and worsens dry mouth.\nA 40-year-old male presents to his family physician with drooping eyelids, difficulty chewing and\nswallowing, and muscle fatigue even on mild exertion. Which agent could be used to diagnose myasthenia\ngravis in this patient?\nA.  Atropine\nB.  Edrophonium\nC.  Pralidoxime\nD.  Echothiophate\nCorrect answer = B. The function of nicotinic receptors in skeletal muscles is diminished in myasthenia gravis\ndue to the development of antibodies to nicotinic receptors (autoimmune disease). Any drug that increases levels\nof ACh in the neuromuscular junction can improve symptoms in myasthenia gravis. Thus, edrophonium, a\nreversible cholinesterase inhibitor with a short duration of action can temporarily improve skeletal muscle\nweakness in myasthenia gravis, serving as a diagnostic tool. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist and has no role\nin skeletal muscle function. Pralidoxime is a drug that is used to reverse the binding of irreversible cholinesterase\ninhibitors with cholinesterase enzyme and helps to reactivate cholinesterase enzyme. Hence, pralidoxime will not\nbe useful in improving skeletal muscle function in myasthenia gravis.\nAtropa belladonna is a plant that contains atropine (a muscarinic antagonist). Which of the following drugs\nor classes of drugs will be most useful in treating poisoning with belladonna?\nA.  Malathion\nB.  Physostigmine\nC.  Muscarinic antagonists\nD.  Nicotinic antagonists179\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 180 ---\n\nCorrect answer = B. Atropine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist that causes anticholinergic effects.\nMuscarinic agonists or any other drugs that increase the levels of ACh are able to counteract effects of atropine.\nThus, anticholinesterases such as malathion and physostigmine can counteract the effects of atropine, in theory.\nHowever, since malathion is an irreversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, it is not used for systemic treatment\nin patients. Muscarinic antagonists worsen the toxicity of atropine. Nicotinic antagonists can worsen the toxicity\nby acting on parasympathetic ganglionic receptors and thus reducing the release of ACh.\n180\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 181 ---\n\n5\nCholinergic Antagonists\nRajan Radhakrishnan and Carinda Feild\n181\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 182 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nCholinergic antagonist is a general term for agents that bind to cholinoceptors (muscarinic or nicotinic) and prevent\nthe effects of acetylcholine (ACh) and other cholinergic agonists. The most clinically useful of these agents are\nselective blockers of muscarinic receptors. They are commonly known as anticholinergic agents (a misnomer, as\nthey antagonize only muscarinic receptors), antimuscarinic agents (more accurate terminology), or\nparasympatholytics. The effects of parasympathetic innervation are thus, interrupted by these agents, and the actions\nof sympathetic innervation are left unopposed. A second group of drugs, the ganglionic blockers, shows a preference\nfor nicotinic receptors of the sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia. Clinically, they are the least important\ncholinergic antagonists. A third family of compounds, the neuromuscular blocking agents (mostly nicotinic\nantagonists), interfere with transmission of efferent impulses to skeletal muscles. These drugs are used as skeletal\nmuscle relaxants in surgical anesthesia and as agents to facilitate intubation in surgical and critical care patients.\nFigure 5.1 summarizes the cholinergic antagonists discussed in this chapter.\n182\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 183 ---\n\nFigure 5.1 Summary of selected cholinergic antagonists.\n183\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 184 ---\n\nII.  Antimuscarinic Agents\nCommonly known as anticholinergic drugs, these agents (for example, atropine and scopolamine) block muscarinic\nreceptors (Figure 5.2), causing inhibition of muscarinic functions. In addition, these drugs block the few exceptional\nsympathetic neurons that are cholinergic, such as those innervating the salivary and sweat glands. Because they do\nnot block nicotinic receptors, the anticholinergic drugs (more precisely, antimuscarinic drugs) have little or no action\nat skeletal neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) or autonomic ganglia. The anticholinergic drugs are beneficial in a\nvariety of clinical situations. [Note: A number of antihistamines and antidepressants (mainly tricyclic\nantidepressants) also have antimuscarinic activity.]\nFigure 5.2 Sites of action of cholinergic antagonists.\n184\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 185 ---\n\nA.  Atropine\nAtropine [A-troe-peen] is a tertiary amine extracted from belladonna alkaloid. It has a high affinity for muscarinic\nreceptors and binds competitively to prevent ACh from binding (Figure 5.3). Atropine acts both centrally and\nperipherally. General actions last about 4 hours; however, effects of topical administration in the eye may persist for\ndays. Neuroeffector organs have varying sensitivity to atropine. The greatest inhibitory effects are seen in bronchial\ntissue, salivary and sweat glands, and the heart.\nFigure 5.3 Competition of atropine and scopolamine with acetylcholine for the\nmuscarinic receptor.\n1.  Actions\na.  Eye\nAtropine blocks muscarinic activity in the eye, resulting in mydriasis (dilation of the pupil), unresponsiveness to\nlight, and cycloplegia (inability to focus for near vision). In patients with angle-closure glaucoma, intraocular\npressure may rise dangerously.\nb.  Gastrointestinal (GI)\nAtropine (as the active isomer, L-hyoscyamine [hi-oh-SYE-uh-meen]) can be used as an antispasmodic to reduce\nactivity of the GI tract. Atropine and scopolamine (discussed below) are probably the most potent antispasmodic\ndrugs available. Although gastric motility is reduced, hydrochloric acid production is not significantly affected.\nThus, atropine is not effective for the treatment of ulcers. Doses of atropine that reduce spasms also reduce saliva\nsecretion, ocular accommodation, and urination. These effects decrease compliance with atropine.\nc.  Cardiovascular\nAtropine produces divergent effects on the cardiovascular system, depending on the dose (Figure 5.4). At low doses,\nthe predominant effect is a slight decrease in heart rate. This effect results from blockade of M1 receptors on the\ninhibitory prejunctional (or presynaptic) neurons, thus permitting increased ACh release. Higher doses of atropine\ncause a progressive increase in heart rate by blocking M2 receptors on the sinoatrial node.\n185\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 186 ---\n\nFigure 5.4 Dose-dependent effects of atropine.\nd.  Secretions\nAtropine blocks muscarinic receptors in the salivary glands, producing dryness of the mouth (xerostomia). The\nsalivary glands are exquisitely sensitive to atropine. Sweat and lacrimal glands are similarly affected. [Note:\nInhibition of secretions of sweat glands can cause elevated body temperature, which can be dangerous in children\nand the elderly.]\n2.  Therapeutic uses\na.  Ophthalmic\nTopical atropine exerts both mydriatic and cycloplegic effects, and it permits the measurement of refractive errors\nwithout interference by the accommodative capacity of the eye. Shorter-acting antimuscarinics (cyclopentolate [sye-\nkloe-PEN-toe-late] and tropicamide [troe-PIK-a-mide]) have largely replaced atropine due to prolonged mydriasis\nobserved with atropine (7 to 14 days vs. 6 to 24 hours with other agents). [Note: Phenylephrine or similar α-\nadrenergic drugs are preferred for pupillary dilation if cycloplegia is not required.]\nb.  Antispasmodic\nAtropine is used as an antispasmodic agent to relax the GI tract.\nc.  Cardiovascular\nInjectable atropine is used to treat bradycardia of varying etiologies.\nd.  Antisecretory\nAtropine is sometimes used as an antisecretory agent to block secretions in the respiratory tract prior to surgery.\n[Note: Glycopyrrolate (see below) is also used for this indication.]\ne.  Antidote for cholinergic agonists\n186\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 187 ---\n\nAtropine is used for the treatment of organophosphate (insecticides, nerve gases) poisoning, of overdose of clinically\nused anticholinesterases such as physostigmine, and in some types of mushroom poisoning (certain mushrooms\ncontain cholinergic substances that block cholinesterases). Massive doses of injectable atropine may be required\nover a long period to counteract the poisons. The ability of atropine to enter the central nervous system (CNS) is of\nparticular importance in treating central toxic effects of anticholinesterases.\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\nAtropine is readily absorbed, partially metabolized by the liver, and eliminated primarily in urine. It has a half-life of\nabout 4 hours.\n4.  Adverse effects\nDepending on the dose, atropine may cause dry mouth, blurred vision, “sandy eyes,” tachycardia, urinary retention,\nand constipation. Effects on the CNS include restlessness, confusion, hallucinations, and delirium, which may\nprogress to depression, collapse of the circulatory and respiratory systems, and death. Low doses of cholinesterase\ninhibitors, such as physostigmine, may be used to overcome atropine toxicity. Atropine may also induce\ntroublesome urinary retention. The drug may be dangerous in children, because they are sensitive to its effects,\nparticularly to rapid increases in body temperature.\n187\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 188 ---\n\nB.  Scopolamine\nScopolamine [skoe-POL-a-meen], another tertiary amine plant alkaloid, produces peripheral effects similar to those\nof atropine. However, scopolamine has greater action on the CNS (unlike atropine, CNS effects are observed at\ntherapeutic doses) and a longer duration of action as compared to atropine. It has some special actions as indicated\nbelow.\n1.  Actions\nScopolamine is one of the most effective drugs available for motion sickness (Figure 5.5). It also has the unusual\neffect of blocking short-term memory. In contrast to atropine, scopolamine produces sedation, but at higher doses, it\ncan produce excitement. Scopolamine may produce euphoria and is susceptible to abuse.\nFigure 5.5 Scopolamine is an effective agent for motion sickness.\n2.  Therapeutic uses\nScopolamine is used for the prevention of motion sickness and postoperative nausea and vomiting. For motion\nsickness, it is available as a topical patch that provides effects for up to 3 days. [Note: As with all drugs used for\nmotion sickness, it is much more effective prophylactically than for treating motion sickness once it occurs.]\n3.  Pharmacokinetics and adverse effects\nThese aspects are similar to those of atropine, with the exception of longer half-life.\n188\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 189 ---\n\nC.  Aclidinium , glycopyrrolate, ipratropium , and tiotropium\nIpratropium [i-pra-TROE-pee-um] and tiotropium [TYE-oh-TROE-pee-um] are quaternary derivatives of atropine,\nand glycopyrrolate [glye-koe-PYE-roe-late] and aclidinium [a-kli-DIN-ee-um] are synthetic quaternary compounds.\nIpratropium is classified as a short-acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA), while glycopyrrolate, tiotropium, and\naclidinium are classified as long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) based on the duration of action. These\nagents are approved as bronchodilators for maintenance treatment of bronchospasm associated with chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Ipratropium and tiotropium are also used in the acute management of\nbronchospasm in asthma and chronic management of asthma, respectively (see",

        "content": "Chapter 8) and other types of parkinsonian syndromes, including antipsychotic-induced extrapyramidal\nsymptoms.\n191\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 192 ---\n\nF.  Oxybutynin and other antimuscarinic agents for overactive\nbladder\nOxybutynin [ox-i-BYOO-ti-nin], darifenacin [dar-e-FEN-a-sin], fesoterodine [fes-oh-TER-oh-deen], solifenacin\n[sol-ee-FEN-a-sin], tolterodine [tol-TER-oh-deen], and trospium [TROSE-pee-um] are synthetic atropine-like drugs\nwith antimuscarinic actions.\n1.  Actions\nBy competitively blocking muscarinic (M3) receptors in the bladder, intravesical pressure is lowered, bladder\ncapacity is increased, and the frequency of bladder contractions is reduced. Antimuscarinic actions at M3 receptors\nin the GI tract, salivary glands, CNS, and eye may cause adverse effects. Darifenacin and solifenacin are relatively\nmore selective M3 muscarinic receptor antagonists; however, the other drugs are mainly nonselective muscarinic\nantagonists, and binding to other muscarinic receptor subtypes may contribute to adverse effects.\n2.  Therapeutic uses\nThese agents are used for management of overactive bladder and urinary incontinence. Oxybutynin is also used in\npatients with neurogenic bladder.\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\nAll of the agents are available in oral dosage forms. Most agents have a long half-life, which allows once-daily\nadministration. [Note: Immediate-release oxybutynin and tolterodine must be dosed two or more times daily;\nhowever, extended-release formulations of these agents allow for once-daily dosing.] Oxybutynin is also available in\na transdermal patch and topical gel formulation. These drugs are hepatically metabolized by the cytochrome P450\nsystem (primarily CYP 3A4 and 2D6), with the exception of trospium, which is thought to undergo ester hydrolysis.\n4.  Adverse effects\nSide effects include dry mouth, constipation, and blurred vision, which limit tolerability of these agents. Extended-\nrelease formulations and the transdermal patch have a lower incidence of adverse effects and may be better tolerated.\nTrospium is a quaternary compound that minimally crosses the blood–brain barrier and has fewer CNS effects than\ndo other agents, making it a preferred choice in treating overactive bladder in patients with dementia. Important\ncharacteristics of the muscarinic antagonists are summarized in Figures 5.6 and 5.7.\n192\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 193 ---\n\nFigure 5.6 Adverse effects commonly observed with muscarinic antagonists.\n193\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 194 ---\n\nFigure 5.7 Summary of cholinergic antagonists. *Contraindicated in angle-closure\nglaucoma.

Ganglionic Blockers\nGanglionic blockers specifically act on the nicotinic receptors of both parasympathetic and sympathetic autonomic\nganglia. Some also block the ion channels of the autonomic ganglia. These drugs show no selectivity toward the\nparasympathetic or sympathetic ganglia and are not effective as neuromuscular antagonists. Thus, these drugs block\nthe entire output of the autonomic nervous system at the nicotinic receptor. Except for nicotine, the other drugs\nmentioned in this category are nondepolarizing, competitive antagonists. The responses of the nondepolarizing\nblockers are complex and mostly unpredictable. Therefore, ganglionic blockade is rarely used therapeutically, but\noften serves as a tool in experimental pharmacology.\n196\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 197 ---\n\nA.  Nicotine\nA component of cigarette smoke, nicotine [NIK-oh-teen] is a poison with many undesirable actions. It is without\ntherapeutic benefit and is deleterious to health. Depending on the dose, nicotine depolarizes autonomic ganglia,\nresulting first in stimulation and then in paralysis of all ganglia. The stimulatory effects are complex and result from\nincreased release of neurotransmitters (Figure 5.8), due to effects on both sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia\n(see",

Neuromuscular Blocking Agents\nThese drugs block cholinergic transmission between motor nerve endings and the nicotinic receptors on skeletal\nmuscle (Figure 5.2). They possess some chemical similarities to ACh and act either as antagonists (nondepolarizing)\nor as agonists (depolarizing) at the receptors on the endplate of the NMJ. Neuromuscular blockers (NMBs) are\nclinically useful to facilitate rapid intubation when needed due to respiratory failure (rapid sequence intubation).\nDuring surgery, they are used to facilitate endotracheal intubation and provide complete muscle relaxation at lower\nanesthetic doses. This increases the safety of anesthesia by allowing patients to recover quickly and completely.\nNMBs should not substitute for inadequate anesthesia. NMBs are also used in the intensive care unit (ICU) as\nadjuvant therapy to facilitate intubation and mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients.\n200\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 201 ---\n\nA.  Nondepolarizing (competitive) blockers\nThe first known NMB was curare [kyoo-RAH-ree], which Amazon hunters used to paralyze prey. The development\nof tubocurarine [too-boe-kyoo-AR-een] followed, but it has been replaced by agents with fewer adverse effects,\nsuch as cisatracurium [cis-a-trah-CURE-ih-um], mivacurium [mi-vah-KYOO-ree-um], pancuronium [pan-kure-OH-\nnee-um], rocuronium [roe-kyoor-OH-nee-um], and vecuronium [ve-KYOO-roe-nee-um].\n1.  Mechanism of action\na.  At low doses\nNMBs competitively block ACh at the nicotinic receptors (Figure 5.9). They compete with ACh at the receptor\nwithout stimulating it, thus preventing depolarization of the muscle cell membrane and inhibiting muscular\ncontraction. Their competitive action can be overcome by administration of cholinesterase inhibitors, such as\nneostigmine and edrophonium, which increase the concentration of ACh in the NMJ. Clinicians employ this strategy\nto shorten the duration of neuromuscular blockade. In addition, at low doses the muscle responds to direct electrical\nstimulation from a peripheral nerve stimulator to varying degrees, allowing for monitoring of the extent of\nneuromuscular blockade.\nFigure 5.9 Mechanism of action of competitive neuromuscular blocking drugs.\nb.  At high doses\nNondepolarizing agents can block the ion channels of the motor end plate. This leads to further weakening of\nneuromuscular transmission, reducing the ability of cholinesterase inhibitors to reverse the actions of the\nnondepolarizing blockers. With complete blockade, the muscle does not respond to direct electrical stimulation.\n2.  Actions\nMuscles have differing sensitivity to blockade by competitive agents. Small, rapidly contracting muscles of the face\nand eye are most susceptible and are paralyzed first, followed by the fingers, limbs, neck, and trunk muscles. Next,\nthe intercostal muscles are affected and, lastly, the diaphragm. The muscles recover in the reverse manner. [Note:\nSugammadex is a selective relaxant-binding agent that terminates the action of both rocuronium and vecuronium and\ncan be used to speed recovery (see",

        "content": "Chapter 13).]\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\nAll NMBs are injected intravenously or occasionally intramuscularly. These agents possess two or more quaternary\namines in their bulky ring structure that prevent absorption from the gut. They penetrate membranes very poorly and\ndo not enter cells or cross the blood–brain barrier. Drug action is terminated in a variety of ways ( Figure 5.10).\nPancuronium is excreted unchanged in urine. Cisatracurium undergoes organ-independent metabolism (via\nHofmann elimination) to laudanosine, which is further metabolized and renally excreted. The amino steroid drugs\nvecuronium and rocuronium are deacetylated in the liver and excreted unchanged in bile. Mivacurium is eliminated\nby plasma cholinesterase. The choice of agent depends on the desired onset and duration of muscle relaxation and\nthe route of elimination. Characteristics of the neuromuscular-blocking drugs are shown in Figure 5.11.\n201\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 202 ---\n\nFigure 5.10 Pharmacokinetics of the neuromuscular blocking drugs.

Adverse effects\nIn general, these agents are safe with minimal side effects. The adverse effects of the specific NMBs are shown in\nFigure 5.11.\n5.  Drug interactions\na.  Cholinesterase inhibitors\nDrugs such as neostigmine, physostigmine, pyridostigmine, and edrophonium can overcome the action of\nnondepolarizing NMBs. However, with increased dosage, cholinesterase inhibitors can cause a depolarizing block\ndue to elevated ACh concentrations at the end plate membrane. If the NMB has entered the ion channel (is bound to\nthe receptor), cholinesterase inhibitors are not as effective in overcoming blockade.\nb.  Halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics\nDrugs such as desflurane act to enhance neuromuscular blockade by exerting a stabilizing action at the NMJ. These\nagents sensitize the NMJ to the effects of NMBs.\nc.  Aminoglycoside antibiotics\nDrugs such as gentamicin and tobramycin inhibit ACh release from cholinergic nerves by competing with calcium\nions. They synergize with competitive blockers, enhancing neuromuscular blockade.\nd.  Calcium channel blockers\nThese agents may increase the neuromuscular blockade of competitive blockers.\n204\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 205 ---\n\nB.  Depolarizing agents\nDepolarizing blocking agents work by depolarizing the plasma membrane of the muscle fiber, similar to the action\nof ACh. However, these agents are more resistant to degradation by acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and can more\npersistently depolarize the muscle fibers. Succinylcholine [suk-sin-il-KOE-leen] is the only depolarizing muscle\nrelaxant in use today.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nSuccinylcholine attaches to the nicotinic receptor and acts like ACh to depolarize the junction ( Figure 5.12). Unlike\nACh, which is instantly destroyed by AChE, the depolarizing agent persists at high concentrations in the synaptic\ncleft, remaining attached to the receptor for a longer time and providing sustained depolarization of the muscle cell.\n[Note: The duration of action is dependent on diffusion from the motor end plate and hydrolysis by plasma\ncholinesterase (also called butyrylcholinesterase or pseudocholinesterase). Genetic variants in which plasma\ncholinesterase levels are low or absent lead to prolonged neuromuscular paralysis.] The depolarizing agent first\ncauses opening of the sodium channel associated with nicotinic receptors, which results in depolarization of the\nreceptor (phase I). This leads to a transient twitching of the muscle (fasciculations). Continued binding of the\ndepolarizing agent renders the receptor incapable of transmitting further impulses. With time, continuous\ndepolarization gives way to gradual repolarization as the sodium channel closes or is blocked. This causes a\nresistance to depolarization (phase II) and flaccid paralysis.\n205\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 206 ---\n\nFigure 5.12 Mechanism of action of depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs.\n206\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 207 ---\n\n2.  Actions\nAs with the competitive blockers, the respiratory muscles are paralyzed last. Succinylcholine initially produces brief\nmuscle fasciculations that cause muscle soreness. This may be prevented by administering a small dose of\nnondepolarizing NMB prior to succinylcholine. Normally, the duration of action of succinylcholine is extremely\nshort, due to rapid hydrolysis by plasma cholinesterase. However, succinylcholine that reaches the NMJ is not\nmetabolized, allowing the agent to bind to nicotinic receptors, and redistribution to plasma is necessary for\nmetabolism.\n3.  Therapeutic uses\nBecause of its rapid onset of action, succinylcholine is useful when rapid endotracheal intubation is required. It is\nalso used during electroconvulsive shock treatment.\n4.  Pharmacokinetics\nSuccinylcholine is injected intravenously. Its brief duration of action results from redistribution and rapid hydrolysis\nby plasma cholinesterase. Drug effects rapidly disappear upon discontinuation.\n5.  Adverse effects\na.  Hyperthermia\nSuccinylcholine can potentially induce malignant hyperthermia in susceptible patients (see",

Which drug was\nmost likely used?\nA.  Acetylcholine\nB.  Pilocarpine\nC.  Tropicamide\nD.  Bethanechol\nCorrect answer = C. Muscarinic agonists such as ACh, pilocarpine, and bethanechol contract the circular muscles\nof iris sphincter and cause constriction of the pupil (miosis), whereas muscarinic antagonists such as tropicamide\nprevent contraction of the circular muscles of the iris and cause dilation of the pupil (mydriasis).\nSarin is a nerve gas that is an organophosphate cholinesterase inhibitor. Which agent could be used as an\nantidote to sarin poisoning?\nA.  Pilocarpine\nB.  Carbachol\nC.  Atropine\nD.  Physostigmine\nCorrect answer = C. Sarin is an organophosphate cholinesterase inhibitor. It causes an increase in ACh levels in\ntissues that leads to cholinergic crisis through activation of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. Most symptoms of\ncholinergic crisis are mediated by muscarinic receptors and, therefore, the muscarinic antagonist atropine is used\nas an antidote for sarin poisoning. Cholinergic agonists such as pilocarpine, carbachol, and physostigmine\n(indirect agonists) worsen symptoms of sarin poisoning.\nA patient with Alzheimer disease needs treatment for overactive bladder (OAB). Which drug is the best\nchoice for this patient?\nA.  Darifenacin\nB.  Solifenacin\nC.  Tolterodine\nD.  Trospium\nCorrect answer = D. All of agents for OAB except trospium cross the blood–brain barrier to various degrees and\ncould worsen dementia symptoms in Alzheimer disease. Trospium is a quaternary ammonium compound that\nminimally crosses the blood–brain barrier.\nA patient with asthma was prescribed a β2 agonist for acute relief of bronchospasm, but did not respond to\ntreatment. Which drug is the most likely next option for this patient?\nA.  Benztropine\nB.  Ipratropium\nC.  Oxybutynin\nD.  Physostigmine\nCorrect answer = B. Major receptors present in the bronchial tissues are muscarinic and adrenergic β2 receptors.\nMuscarinic activation causes bronchoconstriction, and β2 receptor activation causes bronchodilation. Therefore,\ndirect or indirect (physostigmine) muscarinic agonists worsen bronchospasm. Ipratropium is a muscarinic\nantagonist that can relax bronchial smooth muscles and relieve bronchospasm in patients who are not responsive\nto β2 agonists. Benztropine is used in the treatment of Parkinson disease or relief of extrapyramidal symptoms\nfrom antipsychotics. Oxybutynin is used for overactive bladder.\nA 50-year-old male who is noncompliant with medications was recently diagnosed with chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease (COPD). His physician would like to prescribe an inhaled anticholinergic that is dosed\nonce or twice daily. Which drug is most appropriate for this patient?\nA.  Atropine\nB.  Ipratropium\nC.  Tiotropium\nD.  Trospium\nCorrect answer = C. The physician should prescribe a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) so that the\npatient has to inhale the medication only 1 or 2 times daily. Tiotropium is a LAMA, whereas ipratropium is a\nshort-acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA). Atropine and trospium are muscarinic antagonists, but are not\nindicated for pulmonary conditions such as asthma or COPD and are not available as inhaled formulations.208\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 209 ---\n\n5.6\n5.7\n5.8\n5.9\n5.10Which is the most effective drug for motion sickness for a person planning to go on a cruise?\nA.  Atropine\nB.  Fesoterodine\nC.  Scopolamine\nD.  Tropicamide\nCorrect answer = C. All muscarinic antagonists (anticholinergic drugs) listed are theoretically useful as\nantimotion sickness drugs; however, scopolamine is the most effective in preventing motion sickness.\nTropicamide mostly has ophthalmic uses, and fesoterodine is used for overactive bladder.\nWhich is correct regarding ganglion-blocking drugs?\nA.  Blockade of sympathetic ganglia could result in reduced blood pressure.\nB.  Blockade of parasympathetic ganglia could result in reduced heart rate.\nC.  Nicotine is a nondepolarizing ganglion blocker.\nD.  Atropine is a nondepolarizing ganglion blocker.\nCorrect answer = A. Selective blockade (in theory) of the sympathetic ganglion causes reduction in\nnorepinephrine release and, therefore, reduction in heart rate and blood pressure. Selective blockade (in theory) of\nthe parasympathetic ganglion causes reduction in ACh release and an increase in heart rate. Receptors at both\nsympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia are of the nicotinic type. Nicotine is an agonist at nicotinic receptors\nand produces a depolarizing block in the ganglia. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist and has no effect on the\nnicotinic receptors found in the ganglia.\nWhich drug is useful in treating sinus bradycardia?\nA.  Atropine\nB.  Cisatracurium\nC.  Neostigmine\nD.  Succinylcholine\nCorrect answer = A. Sinus bradycardia is a condition where the heart rate is below normal and most often caused\nby increased vagal tone (increased release of ACh in the sinoatrial [SA] node that acts on muscarinic receptors to\nreduce heart rate). A muscarinic antagonist such as atropine is useful in this situation to bring the heart rate back\nto normal. Succinylcholine and cisatracurium are nicotinic antagonists and have no effect on muscarinic receptors\nin the SA node. Neostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor and can worsen bradycardia by increasing the level of\nACh in the SA node.\nAn ICU patient with severe lung injury requires a neuromuscular blocking agent to assist in his ventilator\nmanagement. He has liver disease and is currently in renal failure. Which neuromuscular blocker is the best\nchoice for this patient?\nA.  Cisatracurium\nB.  Pancuronium\nC.  Vecuronium\nD.  Rocuronium\nCorrect answer = A. Pancuronium is renally eliminated and the patient has renal failure. Vecuronium and\nrocuronium are hepatically metabolized and the patient has liver disease. Cisatracurium is cleared by organ-\nindependent metabolism (Hofmann elimination).\nWhere would you expect to see the first return of function in skeletal muscles following discontinuation of a\nnondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent?\nA.  Arms\nB.  Diaphragm\nC.  Fingers\nD.  Pupils\nCorrect answer = B. Following administration of a neuromuscular blocker, the facial muscles are impacted first,\nbut the pupils are not controlled by skeletal muscle and are not affected. The fingers and arms would be next, with\nthe diaphragm function lost last. Function returns in the opposite order, so function of the diaphragm returns first.209\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 210 ---\n\n6\nAdrenergic Agonists\nRajan Radhakrishnan\n210\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 211 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nThe adrenergic drugs affect receptors that are stimulated by norepinephrine (noradrenaline) or epinephrine\n(adrenaline). These receptors are known as adrenergic receptors or adrenoceptors. Drugs that activate adrenergic\nreceptors are termed sympathomimetics, and drugs that block activation of adrenergic receptors are termed\nsympatholytics. Some sympathomimetics directly activate adrenergic receptors (direct-acting agonists), while others\nact indirectly by enhancing release or blocking reuptake of norepinephrine (indirect-acting agonists).

The Adrenergic Neuron\nAdrenergic neurons release norepinephrine as the primary neurotransmitter. These neurons are found in the central\nnervous system (CNS) and in the sympathetic nervous system, where they serve as links between ganglia and the\neffector organs. Adrenergic drugs act on adrenergic receptors, located either presynaptically on the neuron or\npostsynaptically on the effector organ (Figure 6.2).\nFigure 6.2 Sites of actions of adrenergic agonists.\n213\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 214 ---\n\nA.  Neurotransmission at adrenergic neurons\nNeurotransmission in adrenergic neurons closely resembles that described for the cholinergic neurons (see Chapter\n4), except that norepinephrine is the neurotransmitter instead of acetylcholine. Neurotransmission involves the\nfollowing steps: synthesis, storage, release, and receptor binding of norepinephrine, followed by removal of the\nneurotransmitter from the synaptic gap (Figure 6.3).\nFigure 6.3 Synthesis and release of norepinephrine from the adrenergic neuron. DOPA =\ndihydroxyphenylalanine; MAO = monoamine oxidase; NE = norepinephrine; SNRI =\nserotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor.\n1.  Synthesis of norepinephrine\nTyrosine is transported by a carrier into the adrenergic neuron, where it is hydroxylated to dihydroxyphenylalanine\n(DOPA) by tyrosine hydroxylase. This is the rate-limiting step in the formation of norepinephrine. DOPA is then\ndecarboxylated by the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase to form dopamine in the presynaptic neuron.\n2.  Storage of norepinephrine in vesicles\nDopamine is then transported into synaptic vesicles by an amine transporter system. This carrier system is blocked\nby reserpine (see",

Release of norepinephrine\nAn action potential arriving at the nerve junction triggers an influx of calcium ions from the extracellular fluid into\nthe cytoplasm of the neuron. The increase in calcium causes synaptic vesicles to fuse with the cell membrane and to\nundergo exocytosis and expel their contents into the synapse. Drugs such as guanethidine block this release.\n4.  Binding to receptors\nNorepinephrine released from the synaptic vesicles diffuses into the synaptic space and binds to postsynaptic214\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 215 ---\n\nreceptors on the effector organ or to presynaptic receptors on the nerve ending. Binding of norepinephrine to\nreceptors triggers a cascade of events within the cell, resulting in the formation of intracellular second messengers\nthat act as links (transducers) in the communication between the neurotransmitter and the action generated within the\neffector cell. Adrenergic receptors use both the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) second messenger system\nand the phosphatidylinositol cycle to transduce the signal into an effect. Norepinephrine also binds to presynaptic\nreceptors (mainly α2 subtype) that modulate the release of the neurotransmitter.\n5.  Removal of norepinephrine\nNorepinephrine may 1) diffuse out of the synaptic space and enter the systemic circulation, 2) be metabolized to\ninactive metabolites by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) in the synaptic space, or 3) undergo reuptake back\ninto the neuron. The reuptake by the neuronal membrane involves a sodium–chloride (Na+/Cl−)–dependent\nnorepinephrine transporter that can be inhibited by tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), such as imipramine; by\nserotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors such as duloxetine; or by cocaine. Reuptake of norepinephrine into the\npresynaptic neuron is the primary mechanism for termination of its effects.\n6.  Potential fates of recaptured norepinephrine\nOnce norepinephrine reenters the adrenergic neuron, it may be taken up into synaptic vesicles via the amine\ntransporter system and be sequestered for release by another action potential, or it may persist in a protected pool in\nthe cytoplasm. Alternatively, norepinephrine can be oxidized by monoamine oxidase (MAO) present in neuronal\nmitochondria.\n215\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 216 ---\n\nB.  Adrenergic receptors (adrenoceptors)\nIn the sympathetic nervous system, several classes of adrenoceptors can be distinguished pharmacologically. Two\nmain families of receptors, designated α and β, are classified based on response to the adrenergic agonists\nepinephrine, norepinephrine, and isoproterenol . Both the α and β receptor types have a number of specific receptor\nsubtypes. Alterations in the primary structure of the receptors influence their affinity for various agents.\n1.  α-Adrenoceptors\nThe α-adrenoceptors show a weak response to the synthetic agonist isoproterenol , but they are responsive to the\nnaturally occurring catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine (Figure 6.4). For α receptors, the rank order of\npotency and affinity is epinephrine ≥ norepinephrine >> isoproterenol . The α-adrenoceptors are divided into two\nsubtypes, α1 and α2, based on their affinities for α agonists and antagonists. For example, α1 receptors have a higher\naffinity for phenylephrine than α2 receptors. Conversely, the drug clonidine selectively binds to α2 receptors and has\nless effect on α1 receptors.\n216\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 217 ---\n\nFigure 6.4 Types of adrenergic receptors.\na.  α1 Receptors\nThese receptors are present on the postsynaptic membrane of the effector organs and mediate many of the classic\neffects, originally designated as α-adrenergic, involving constriction of smooth muscle. Activation of α1 receptors\ninitiates a series of reactions through the G-protein activation of phospholipase C, ultimately resulting in the\ngeneration of second messengers inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 initiates the\nrelease of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol, and DAG turns on other proteins within the cell\n(Figure 6.5).\n217\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 218 ---\n\nFigure 6.5 Second messengers mediate the effects of α receptors. DAG = diacylglycerol;\nIP3 = inositol trisphosphate; ATP = adenosine triphosphate; cAMP = cyclic adenosine\nmonophosphate.\nb.  α2 Receptors\nThese receptors are located primarily on sympathetic presynaptic nerve endings and control the release of\nnorepinephrine. When a sympathetic adrenergic nerve is stimulated, a portion of the released norepinephrine “circles\nback” and reacts with α2 receptors on the presynaptic membrane (Figure 6.5). Stimulation of α2 receptors causes\nfeedback inhibition and inhibits further release of norepinephrine from the stimulated adrenergic neuron. This\ninhibitory action serves as a local mechanism for modulating norepinephrine output when there is high sympathetic 218\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 219 ---\n\nactivity. [Note: In this instance, by inhibiting further output of norepinephrine from the adrenergic neuron, these\nreceptors are acting as inhibitory autoreceptors.] α2 Receptors are also found on presynaptic parasympathetic\nneurons. Norepinephrine released from a presynaptic sympathetic neuron can diffuse to and interact with these\nreceptors, inhibiting acetylcholine release. [Note: In these instances, these receptors are behaving as inhibitory\nheteroreceptors.] This is another mechanism to modulate autonomic activity in a given area. In contrast to α1\nreceptors, the effects of binding at α2 receptors are mediated by inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and by a fall in the\nlevels of intracellular cAMP.\nc.  Further subdivisions\nThe α1 and α2 receptors are further divided into α1A, α1B, α1C, and α1D and into α2A, α2B, and α2C. This extended\nclassification is necessary for understanding the selectivity of some drugs. For example, tamsulosin is a selective α1A\nantagonist that is used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia. The drug has fewer cardiovascular side effects because it\ntargets α1A subtype receptors found primarily in the urinary tract and prostate gland and does not affect the α1B\nsubtype found in the blood vessels.\n2.  β-Adrenoceptors\nResponses of β receptors differ from those of α receptors and are characterized by a strong response to\nisoproterenol , with less sensitivity to epinephrine and norepinephrine (Figure 6.4). For β receptors, the rank order of\npotency is isoproterenol  > epinephrine > norepinephrine. The β-adrenoceptors can be subdivided into three major\nsubgroups, β1, β2, and β3, based on their affinities for adrenergic agonists and antagonists. β1 receptors have\napproximately equal affinities for epinephrine and norepinephrine, whereas β2 receptors have a higher affinity for\nepinephrine than for norepinephrine. Thus, tissues with a predominance of β2 receptors (such as the vasculature of\nskeletal muscle) are particularly responsive to the effects of circulating epinephrine released by the adrenal medulla.\nBinding of a neurotransmitter at any of the three types of β receptors results in activation of adenylyl cyclase and\nincreased concentrations of cAMP within the cell.\n3.  Distribution of receptors\nAdrenergically innervated organs and tissues usually have a predominant type of receptor. For example, tissues such\nas the vasculature of skeletal muscle have both α1 and β2 receptors, but the β2 receptors predominate. Other tissues\nmay have one type of receptor almost exclusively. For example, the heart contains predominantly β1 receptors.\n4.  Characteristic responses mediated by adrenoceptors\nIt is useful to organize the physiologic responses to adrenergic stimulation according to receptor type, because many\ndrugs preferentially stimulate or block one type of receptor. Figure 6.6 summarizes the most prominent effects\nmediated by the adrenoceptors. As a generalization, stimulation of α1 receptors characteristically produces\nvasoconstriction (particularly in skin and abdominal viscera) and an increase in total peripheral resistance and blood\npressure. Stimulation of β1 receptors characteristically causes cardiac stimulation (increase in heart rate and\ncontractility), whereas stimulation of β2 receptors produces vasodilation (in skeletal muscle vascular beds) and\nsmooth muscle relaxation. β3 Receptors are involved in lipolysis (along with β1), and also have effects on the\ndetrusor muscle of the bladder.\nFigure 6.6 Major effects mediated by α- and β-adrenoceptors.\n5.  Desensitization of receptors\nProlonged exposure to the catecholamines reduces the responsiveness of these receptors, a phenomenon known as\ndesensitization. Three mechanisms have been suggested to explain this phenomenon: 1) sequestration of the\nreceptors so that they are unavailable for interaction with the ligand; 2) down-regulation, that is, a disappearance of\nthe receptors either by destruction or by decreased synthesis; and 3) an inability to couple to G-protein, because the\nreceptor has been phosphorylated on the cytoplasmic side.\n219\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 220 ---\n\n220\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 221 ---\n\nIII.  Characteristics of Adrenergic Agonists\nMost adrenergic drugs are derivatives of β-phenylethylamine (Figure 6.7). Substitutions on the benzene ring or on\nthe ethylamine side chains produce a variety of compounds with varying abilities to differentiate between α and β\nreceptors and to penetrate the CNS. Two important structural features of these drugs are 1) the number and location\nof OH substitutions on the benzene ring and 2) the nature of the substituent on the amino nitrogen.\n221\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 222 ---\n\n222\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 223 ---\n\nFigure 6.7 Structures of several important adrenergic agonists. Drugs containing the\ncatechol ring are shown in yellow .\n223\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 224 ---\n\nA.  Catecholamines\nSympathomimetic amines that contain the 3,4-dihydroxybenzene group (such as epinephrine, norepinephrine,\nisoproterenol , and dopamine) are called catecholamines. These compounds share the following properties:\n1.  High potency\nCatecholamines show the highest potency in directly activating α or β receptors.\n2.  Rapid inactivation\nCatecholamines are metabolized by COMT postsynaptically and by MAO intraneuronally, by COMT and MAO in\nthe gut wall, and by MAO in the liver. Thus, catecholamines have only a brief period of action when given\nparenterally, and they are inactivated (ineffective) when administered orally.\n3.  Poor penetration into the CNS\nCatecholamines are polar and, therefore, do not readily penetrate into the CNS. Nevertheless, most catecholamines\nhave some clinical effects (anxiety, tremor, and headaches) that are attributable to action on the CNS.\n224\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 225 ---\n\nB.  Noncatecholamines\nCompounds lacking the catechol hydroxyl groups have longer half-lives, because they are not inactivated by COMT.\nThese include phenylephrine, ephedrine, and amphetamine (Figure 6.7). These agents are poor substrates for MAO\n(an important route of metabolism) and, thus, show a prolonged duration of action. Increased lipid solubility of\nmany of the noncatecholamines (due to lack of polar hydroxyl groups) permits greater access to the CNS.\n225\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 226 ---\n\nC.  Substitutions on the amine nitrogen\nThe nature of the substituent on the amine nitrogen is important in determining β selectivity of the adrenergic\nagonist. For example, epinephrine, with a –CH3 substituent on the amine nitrogen, is more potent at β receptors than\nnorepinephrine, which has an unsubstituted amine. Similarly, isoproterenol , which has an isopropyl substituent –\nCH(CH3)2 on the amine nitrogen (Figure 6.7), is a strong β agonist with little α activity (Figure 6.4).\n226\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 227 ---\n\nD.  Mechanism of action of adrenergic agonists\n1.  Direct-acting agonists\nThese drugs act directly on α or β receptors, producing effects similar to those that occur following stimulation of\nsympathetic nerves or release of epinephrine from the adrenal medulla (Figure 6.8). Examples of direct-acting\nagonists include epinephrine, norepinephrine, isoproterenol , dopamine, and phenylephrine.\nFigure 6.8 Sites of action of direct-, indirect-, and mixed-acting adrenergic agonists.\n2.  Indirect-acting agonists\nThese agents may block the reuptake of norepinephrine or cause the release of norepinephrine from the cytoplasmic\npools or vesicles of the adrenergic neuron (Figure 6.8). The norepinephrine then traverses the synapse and binds to α\nor β receptors. Examples of reuptake inhibitors and agents that cause norepinephrine release include cocaine and\n227\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 228 ---\n\namphetamine, respectively.\n3.  Mixed-action agonists\nEphedrine and its stereoisomer, pseudoephedrine, both stimulate adrenoceptors directly and enhance release of\nnorepinephrine from the adrenergic neuron (Figure 6.8).\n228\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 229 ---\n\nIV.  Direct-Acting Adrenergic Agonists\nDirect-acting agonists bind to adrenergic receptors on effector organs without interacting with the presynaptic\nneuron. As a group, these agents are widely used in clinical practice.\n229\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 230 ---\n\nA.  Epinephrine\nEpinephrine [ep-i-NEF-rin] is one of the four catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, and\ndobutamine) commonly used in therapy. The first three are naturally occurring neurotransmitters, and the latter is a\nsynthetic compound. In the adrenal medulla, norepinephrine is methylated to yield epinephrine, which is stored in\nchromaffin cells along with norepinephrine. On stimulation, the adrenal medulla releases about 80% epinephrine\nand 20% norepinephrine directly into the circulation. Epinephrine interacts with both α and β receptors. At low\ndoses, β effects (vasodilation) on the vascular system predominate, whereas at high doses, α effects\n(vasoconstriction) are the strongest.\n1.  Actions\na.  Cardiovascular\nThe major actions of epinephrine are on the cardiovascular system. Epinephrine strengthens the contractility of the\nmyocardium (positive inotrope: β1 action) and increases its rate of contraction (positive chronotrope: β1 action).\nTherefore, cardiac output increases. These effects increase oxygen demands on the myocardium. Epinephrine\nactivates β1 receptors on the kidney to cause renin release. Renin is an enzyme involved in the production of\nangiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. Epinephrine constricts arterioles in the skin, mucous membranes, and\nviscera (α effects), and it dilates vessels going to the liver and skeletal muscle (β2 effects). These combined effects\nresult in a decrease in renal blood flow. Therefore, the cumulative effect is an increase in systolic blood pressure,\ncoupled with a slight decrease in diastolic pressure due to β2 receptor–mediated vasodilation in the skeletal muscle\nvascular bed (Figure 6.9).\n230\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 231 ---\n\nFigure 6.9 Cardiovascular effects of intravenous infusion of low doses of epinephrine.\nb.  Respiratory\nEpinephrine causes powerful bronchodilation by acting directly on bronchial smooth muscle (β2 action). It also\ninhibits the release of allergy mediators such as histamine from mast cells.\n231\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 232 ---\n\nc.  Hyperglycemia\nEpinephrine has a significant hyperglycemic effect because of increased glycogenolysis in the liver (β2 effect),\nincreased release of glucagon (β2 effect), and a decreased release of insulin (α2 effect).\nd.  Lipolysis\nEpinephrine initiates lipolysis through agonist activity on the β receptors of adipose tissue. Increased levels of\ncAMP stimulate a hormone-sensitive lipase, which hydrolyzes triglycerides to free fatty acids and glycerol.\n2.  Therapeutic uses\na.  Bronchospasm\nEpinephrine is the primary drug used in the emergency treatment of respiratory conditions when\nbronchoconstriction has resulted in diminished respiratory function. Thus, in treatment of anaphylactic shock,\nepinephrine is the drug of choice and can be lifesaving in this setting. Within a few minutes after subcutaneous\nadministration, respiratory function greatly improves.\na.  Anaphylactic shock\nEpinephrine is the drug of choice for the treatment of type I hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) in\nresponse to allergens.\na.  Cardiac arrest\nEpinephrine may be used to restore cardiac rhythm in patients with cardiac arrest.\nd.  Local anesthesia\nLocal anesthetic solutions may contain low concentrations (for example, 1:100,000 parts) of epinephrine.\nEpinephrine greatly increases the duration of local anesthesia by producing vasoconstriction at the site of injection.\nEpinephrine also reduces systemic absorption of the local anesthetic and promotes local hemostasis.\ne.  Intraocular surgery\nEpinephrine is used in the induction and maintenance of mydriasis during intraocular surgery.\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\nEpinephrine has a rapid onset but a brief duration of action (due to rapid degradation). The preferred route for\nanaphylaxis in the outpatient setting is intramuscular (anterior thigh) due to rapid absorption. In emergencies,\nepinephrine is given intravenously (IV) for the most rapid onset of action. It may also be given subcutaneously, by\nendotracheal tube, or by inhalation (Figure 6.10). It is rapidly metabolized by MAO and COMT, and the metabolites\nmetanephrine and vanillylmandelic acid are excreted in urine.\nFigure 6.10 Pharmacokinetics of epinephrine . CNS = central nervous system.\n232\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 233 ---\n\n4.  Adverse effects\nEpinephrine can produce adverse CNS effects that include anxiety, fear, tension, headache, and tremor. It can trigger\ncardiac arrhythmias, particularly if the patient is receiving digoxin. Epinephrine can also induce pulmonary edema\ndue to increased afterload caused by vasoconstrictive properties of the drug. Patients with hyperthyroidism may\nhave an increased production of adrenergic receptors in the vasculature, leading to an enhanced response to\nepinephrine, and the dose must be reduced in these individuals. Inhalation anesthetics also sensitize the heart to the\neffects of epinephrine, which may lead to tachycardia. Epinephrine increases the release of endogenous stores of\nglucose. In diabetic patients, dosages of insulin may have to be increased. Nonselective β-blockers prevent\nvasodilatory effects of epinephrine on β2 receptors, leaving α receptor stimulation unopposed. This may lead to\nincreased peripheral resistance and increased blood pressure.\n233\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 234 ---\n\nB.  Norepinephrine\nBecause norepinephrine [nor-ep-ih-NEF-rin] is the neurotransmitter in the adrenergic neurons, it should,\ntheoretically, stimulate all types of adrenergic receptors. However, when administered in therapeutic doses, the α-\nadrenergic receptor is most affected.\n1.  Cardiovascular actions\na.  Vasoconstriction\nNorepinephrine causes a rise in peripheral resistance due to intense vasoconstriction of most vascular beds,\nincluding the kidney (α1 effect). Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures increase ( Figure 6.11). [Note:\nNorepinephrine causes greater vasoconstriction than epinephrine, because it does not induce compensatory\nvasodilation via β2 receptors on blood vessels supplying skeletal muscles. The weak β2 activity of norepinephrine\nalso explains why it is not useful in the treatment of bronchospasm or anaphylaxis.]\n234\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 235 ---\n\n235\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 236 ---\n\nFigure 6.11 Cardiovascular effects of intravenous infusion of norepinephrine.\nb.  Baroreceptor reflex\nNorepinephrine increases blood pressure, and this stimulates the baroreceptors, inducing a rise in vagal activity. The\nincreased vagal activity produces a reflex bradycardia, which is sufficient to counteract the local actions of\nnorepinephrine on the heart, although the reflex compensation does not affect the positive inotropic effects of the\ndrug (Figure 6.11). When atropine, which blocks the transmission of vagal effects, is given before norepinephrine,\nstimulation of the heart by norepinephrine is evident as tachycardia.\n2.  Therapeutic uses\nNorepinephrine is used to treat shock (for example, septic shock), because it increases vascular resistance and,\ntherefore, increases blood pressure. It has no other clinically significant uses.\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\nNorepinephrine is given IV for rapid onset of action. The duration of action is 1 to 2 minutes, following the end of\nthe infusion. It is rapidly metabolized by MAO and COMT, and inactive metabolites are excreted in the urine.\n4.  Adverse effects\nThese are similar to epinephrine. In addition, norepinephrine is a potent vasoconstrictor and may cause blanching\nand sloughing of skin along an injected vein. If extravasation (leakage of drug from the vessel into tissues\nsurrounding the injection site) occurs, it can cause tissue necrosis. It should not be administered in peripheral veins,\nif possible. Impaired circulation from norepinephrine may be treated with the α receptor antagonist phentolamine.\nAlternatives to phentolamine include intradermal terbutaline and topical nitroglycerin.\n236\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 237 ---\n\nC.  Isoproterenol\nIsoproterenol  [eye-soe-proe-TER-e-nole] is a direct-acting synthetic catecholamine that stimulates both β1- and β2-\nadrenergic receptors. Its nonselectivity is a disadvantage and the reason why it is rarely used therapeutically. Its\naction on α receptors is insignificant. Isoproterenol  produces intense stimulation of the heart (β1 effect), increasing\nheart rate, contractility, and cardiac output (Figure 6.12). It is as active as epinephrine in this action. Isoproterenol\nalso dilates the arterioles of skeletal muscle (β2 effect), resulting in decreased peripheral resistance. Because of its\ncardiac stimulatory action, it may increase systolic blood pressure slightly, but it greatly reduces mean arterial and\ndiastolic blood pressures (Figure 6.12). Isoproterenol  is also a potent bronchodilator (β2 effect). The adverse effects\nof isoproterenol  are similar to the β receptor–related side effects of epinephrine.\n237\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 238 ---\n\n238\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 239 ---\n\nFigure 6.12 Cardiovascular effects of intravenous infusion of isoproterenol.\n239\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 240 ---\n\nD.  Dopamine\nDopamine [DOE-pa-meen], the immediate metabolic precursor of norepinephrine, occurs naturally in the CNS in\nthe basal ganglia, where it functions as a neurotransmitter, as well as in the adrenal medulla. Dopamine can activate\nα- and β-adrenergic receptors. For example, at higher doses, it causes vasoconstriction by activating α1 receptors,\nwhereas at lower doses, it stimulates β1 cardiac receptors. In addition, D1 and D2 dopaminergic receptors, distinct\nfrom the α- and β-adrenergic receptors, occur in the peripheral mesenteric and renal vascular beds, where binding of\ndopamine produces vasodilation. D2 receptors are also found on presynaptic adrenergic neurons, where their\nactivation interferes with norepinephrine release.\n1.  Actions\na.  Cardiovascular\nDopamine exerts a stimulatory effect on the β1 receptors of the heart, having both positive inotropic and\nchronotropic effects (Figure 6.13). At very high doses, dopamine activates α1 receptors on the vasculature, resulting\nin vasoconstriction.\n240\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 241 ---\n\n241\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 242 ---\n\nFigure 6.13 Clinically important actions of isoproterenol and dopamine.\nb.  Renal and visceral\nDopamine dilates renal and splanchnic arterioles by activating dopaminergic receptors, thereby increasing blood\nflow to the kidneys and other viscera (Figure 6.13). These receptors are not affected by α- or β-blocking drugs, and\nin the past, low-dose (“renal-dose”) dopamine was often used in the prevention or treatment of acute renal failure.\nHowever, more recent data suggest there is limited clinical utility in the renal protective effects of dopamine.\n2.  Therapeutic uses\nDopamine can be used for cardiogenic and septic shock and is given by continuous infusion. It raises blood pressure\nby stimulating the β1 receptors on the heart to increase cardiac output, and α1 receptors on blood vessels to increase\ntotal peripheral resistance. It enhances perfusion to the kidney and splanchnic areas, as described above. Increased\nblood flow to the kidney enhances the glomerular filtration rate and causes diuresis. By contrast, norepinephrine can\ndiminish blood supply to the kidney and may reduce renal function. Dopamine is also used to treat hypotension,\nsevere heart failure, and bradycardia unresponsive to other treatments.\n3.  Adverse effects\nAn overdose of dopamine produces the same effects as sympathetic stimulation. Dopamine is rapidly metabolized\nby MAO or COMT, and its adverse effects (nausea, hypertension, and arrhythmias) are, therefore, short lived.\n242\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 243 ---\n\nE.  Fenoldopam\nFenoldopam [fen-OL-de-pam] is an agonist of peripheral dopamine D1 receptors. It is used as a rapid-acting\nvasodilator to treat severe hypertension in hospitalized patients, acting on coronary arteries, kidney arterioles, and\nmesenteric arteries. Fenoldopam is a racemic mixture, and the R-isomer is the active component. It undergoes\nextensive first-pass metabolism and has a 10-minute elimination half-life after IV infusion. Headache, flushing,\ndizziness, nausea, vomiting, and tachycardia (due to vasodilation) may occur with this agent.\n243\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 244 ---\n\nF.  Dobutamine\nDobutamine [doe-BYOO-ta-meen] is a synthetic, direct-acting catecholamine that is primarily a β1 receptor agonist\nwith minor β2 and α1 effects. It increases heart rate and cardiac output with few vascular effects. Dobutamine is used\nto increase cardiac output in acute heart failure (see",

Oxymetazoline\nOxymetazoline [OX-ee-mee-TAZ-ih-leen] is a direct-acting synthetic adrenergic agonist that stimulates both α1- and\nα2-adrenergic receptors. Oxymetazoline is found in many over-the-counter nasal spray decongestants, as well as in\nophthalmic drops for the relief of redness of the eyes associated with swimming, colds, and contact lenses.\nOxymetazoline directly stimulates α receptors on blood vessels supplying the nasal mucosa and conjunctiva, thereby\nproducing vasoconstriction and decreasing congestion. It is absorbed in the systemic circulation regardless of the\nroute of administration and may produce nervousness, headaches, and trouble sleeping. Local irritation and sneezing\nmay occur with intranasal administration. Use for greater than 3 days is not recommended, as rebound congestion\nand dependence may occur.\n245\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 246 ---\n\nH.  Phenylephrine\nPhenylephrine [fen-ill-EF-reen] is a direct-acting, synthetic adrenergic drug that binds primarily to α1 receptors.\nPhenylephrine is a vasoconstrictor that raises both systolic and diastolic blood pressures. It has no effect on the heart\nitself but, rather, induces reflex bradycardia when given parenterally, making it useful in the treatment of\nparoxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. The drug is used to treat hypotension in hospitalized or surgical patients\n(especially those with a rapid heart rate). Large doses can cause hypertensive headache and cardiac irregularities.\nPhenylephrine acts as a nasal decongestant when applied topically or taken orally. Although data suggest it may not\nbe as effective, phenylephrine has replaced pseudoephedrine in many oral decongestants, since pseudoephedrine has\nbeen misused to make methamphetamine. Phenylephrine is also used in ophthalmic solutions for mydriasis.\n246\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 247 ---\n\nI.  Midodrine\nMidodrine, a prodrug, is metabolized to the pharmacologically active desglymidodrine. It is a selective α1 agonist,\nwhich acts in the periphery to increase arterial and venous tone. Midodrine is indicated for the treatment of\northostatic hypotension. The drug should be given three times daily, with doses at 3- or 4-hour intervals. To avoid\nsupine hypertension, doses within 4 hours of bedtime are not recommended.\n247\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 248 ---\n\nJ.

Both clonidine and the α2 agonist\nguanfacine [GWAHN-fa-seen] may be used in the management of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Clonidine\nacts centrally on presynaptic α2 receptors to produce inhibition of sympathetic vasomotor centers, decreasing\nsympathetic outflow to the periphery. The most common side effects of clonidine are lethargy, sedation,\nconstipation, and xerostomia. Abrupt discontinuation must be avoided to prevent rebound hypertension.

Tyramine\nTyramine [TIE-ra-meen] is not a clinically useful drug, but it is important because it is found in fermented foods,\nsuch as aged cheese and Chianti wine. It is a normal by-product of tyrosine metabolism. Normally, it is oxidized by\nMAO in the gastrointestinal tract, but if the patient is taking MAOIs, it can precipitate serious vasopressor episodes.\nLike amphetamines, tyramine can enter the nerve terminal and displace stored norepinephrine.

Mixed-Action Adrenergic Agonists\nEphedrine [eh-FED-rin] and pseudoephedrine [soo-doe-eh-FED-rin] are mixed-action adrenergic agents. They not\nonly enhance release of stored norepinephrine from nerve endings (Figure 6.8) but also directly stimulate both α and\nβ receptors. Thus, a wide variety of adrenergic actions ensue that are similar to those of epinephrine, although less\npotent. Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are not catecholamines and are poor substrates for COMT and MAO.\nTherefore, these drugs have a long duration of action. Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine have excellent absorption\nafter oral administration and penetrate the CNS, but pseudoephedrine has fewer CNS effects. Ephedrine is\neliminated largely unchanged in urine, and pseudoephedrine undergoes incomplete hepatic metabolism before\nelimination in urine. Ephedrine raises systolic and diastolic blood pressures by vasoconstriction and cardiac\nstimulation and it is indicated in anesthesia-induced hypotension. Ephedrine produces bronchodilation, but it is less\npotent and slower acting than epinephrine or isoproterenol . It was previously used to prevent asthma attacks but has\nbeen replaced by more effective medications. Ephedrine produces a mild stimulation of the CNS. This increases\nalertness, decreases fatigue, and prevents sleep. It also improves athletic performance. [Note: The clinical use of\nephedrine is declining because of the availability of better, more potent agents that cause fewer adverse effects.\nEphedrine-containing herbal supplements (mainly ephedra-containing products) have been banned by the U.S. Food\nand Drug Administration because of life-threatening cardiovascular reactions.] Oral pseudoephedrine is primarily\nused to treat nasal and sinus congestion. Pseudoephedrine has been illegally used to produce methamphetamine.\nTherefore, products containing pseudoephedrine have certain restrictions and must be kept behind the sales counter\nin the United States.

Norepinephrine is the major neurotransmitter released from sympathetic nerve terminals.\nB.  Norepinephrine is mainly released from the adrenal glands.\nC.  Tricyclic antidepressants and cocaine prevent the release of norepinephrine from the nerve terminals.\nD.  Monoamine oxidase (MAO) converts dopamine to norepinephrine in the nerve terminal.\nCorrect answer = A. Norepinephrine (NE) is the major neurotransmitter released from sympathetic nerve\nterminals. Epinephrine, not norepinephrine, is mainly released from the adrenal glands. Tricyclic antidepressants\n(TCAs) and cocaine inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine into the sympathetic nerve terminals, but they do not\nprevent the release of NE. Dopamine is converted to norepinephrine by dopamine β-hydroxylase, not by MAO.\nWhich of the following adrenergic drugs is used in the treatment of overactive bladder?\nA.  Epinephrine\nB.  Dobutamine\nC.  Phenylephrine\nD.  Mirabegron\nCorrect answer = D. Detrusor muscles in the urinary bladder wall have β3 receptors. Stimulation of these\nreceptors relaxes the urinary bladder wall and relieves overactive bladder. Mirabegron is a β3 agonist and\ntherefore used in treating overactive bladder. None of the other drugs listed have β3 agonist activity.\nWhich of the following classes of adrenergic agents has utility in the management of hypertension?\nA.  α1 Agonist\nB.  α2 Agonist\nC.  β1 Agonist\nD.  β3 Agonist\nCorrect answer = B. α2 Agonists activate α2 receptors located in the presynaptic terminal of sympathetic neurons\nand cause a reduction in the release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerve terminals. This leads to a reduction\nin blood pressure. α2 Agonists such as clonidine and methyldopa are therefore used as antihypertensive agents. α1\nAgonists cause vasoconstriction, and β1 agonists cause increased cardiac output and renin release, so these agents\nmay increase blood pressure. β3 Agonists are not used in the management of hypertension.\nWhich of the following is correct regarding responses mediated by adrenergic receptors?\nA.  Stimulation of α1 receptors increases blood pressure.\nB.  Stimulation of sympathetic presynaptic α2 receptors increases norepinephrine release.\nC.  Stimulation of β2 receptors increases heart rate (tachycardia).\nD.  Stimulation of β2 receptors causes bronchoconstriction.\nCorrect answer = A. Stimulation of α1 receptors, mostly found in the blood vessels, causes vasoconstriction and\nan increase in blood pressure. Stimulation of α2 receptors on the sympathetic presynaptic terminal reduces the\nrelease of norepinephrine. β2 receptors are not found in the heart, so activation of β2 receptors does not affect\nheart rate. Stimulation of β2 receptors found in the bronchial tissues causes bronchodilation, not\nbronchoconstriction.\nAn asthma patient was given a nonselective β agonist to relieve bronchoconstriction. Which adverse effect\nwould you expect in this patient?\nA.  Bradycardia\nB.  Tachycardia\nC.  Hypotension (reduction in blood pressure)\nD.  Worsening bronchoconstriction\nCorrect answer = B. A nonselective β agonist activates both β1 and β2 receptors. β1 Activation causes an increase\nin heart rate (tachycardia), contractility, and subsequent increase in blood pressure. It relieves bronchoconstriction\nbecause of the β2 receptor activation.\nA 22-year-old male is brought to the emergency room with suspected cocaine overdose. Which of the\nfollowing symptoms is most likely in this patient?\nA.  Hypertension\nB.  Bronchoconstriction262\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 263 ---\n\n6.7\n6.8\n6.9\n6.10C.  Bradycardia\nD.  Miosis (constriction of pupil)\nCorrect answer = A. Cocaine is an indirect adrenergic agonist that prevents the reuptake of norepinephrine into\nthe nerve terminals, thus increasing the levels of NE in the synaptic cleft. The increase in NE leads to an increase\nin blood pressure (hypertension), tachycardia (not bradycardia), mydriasis (not miosis), and other symptoms of\nsympathetic overactivity.\nA 12-year-old boy with a peanut allergy is brought to the emergency room after accidental consumption of\npeanuts. He is in anaphylactic shock. Which of the following drugs is most appropriate to treat this patient?\nA.  Norepinephrine\nB.  Phenylephrine\nC.  Dobutamine\nD.  Epinephrine\nCorrect answer = D. Norepinephrine has more α agonistic effects and activates mainly α1, α2, and β1 receptors.\nEpinephrine has more β agonistic effects and activates mainly α1, α2, β1, and β2 receptors. Phenylephrine has\npredominantly α effects and activates mainly α1 receptors. Dobutamine mainly activates β1 receptors and has no\nsignificant effects on β2 receptors. Thus, epinephrine is the drug of choice in anaphylactic shock that can both\nstimulate the heart (β1 activation) and dilate bronchioles (β2 activation).\nAn elderly patient is brought to the emergency room with a blood pressure of 76/60 mm Hg, tachycardia, and\nlow cardiac output. He is diagnosed with acute heart failure. Which of the following drugs is most\nappropriate to improve his cardiac function?\nA.  Epinephrine\nB.  Fenoldopam\nC.  Dobutamine\nD.  Isoproterenol\nCorrect answer = C. Among the choices, the ideal drug to increase contractility in acute heart failure is\ndobutamine, since it is a selective β1-adrenergic agonist. Fenoldopam is a dopamine agonist used to treat severe\nhypertension. The other drugs are nonselective adrenergic agonists that could cause unwanted side effects.\nWhich of the following adrenergic agonists is commonly present in nasal sprays available over-the-counter\n(OTC) to treat nasal congestion?\nA.  Clonidine\nB.  Albuterol\nC.  Oxymetazoline\nD.  Formoterol\nCorrect answer = C. Drugs with selective α1 agonistic activity are commonly used as nasal decongestants because\nof their ability to cause vasoconstriction in the nasal vessels. Oxymetazoline is an α1 agonist and therefore the\npreferred drug among the choices as a nasal decongestant. Clonidine is an α2 agonist, albuterol is a β2 agonist, and\nformoterol is a long-acting β2 agonist.\nA patient who has hypertension and mild asthma attacks bought a herbal remedy for asthma online. He does\nnot take any prescription medications for asthma, but takes a β1-selective blocker for hypertension. The\nherbal remedy relieves the asthma attacks, but his blood pressure seems to increase despite the β-blocker\ntherapy. Which of the following drugs is most likely present in the herbal remedy?\nA.  Phenylephrine\nB.  Norepinephrine\nC.  Ephedrine\nD.  Salmeterol\nCorrect answer = C. Both ephedrine and salmeterol can relieve asthma symptoms, as they activate β2 receptors in\nthe bronchioles and cause bronchodilation. However, salmeterol is a selective β2 agonist and should not increase\nblood pressure. By contrast, ephedrine stimulates the release of norepinephrine and acts as a direct agonist at α-\nand β-adrenergic receptors, thus causing an increase in blood pressure. Phenylephrine (a nonselective α agonist)\ndoes not cause bronchodilation, so it would not relieve asthma symptoms. Norepinephrine is a nonselective\nadrenergic agonist that does not have any stimulatory effects on β2 receptors. In addition, norepinephrine is not\nactive when given orally.263\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 264 ---\n\n264\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 265 ---\n\n7\nAdrenergic Antagonists\nRajan Radhakrishnan and Sandhya Jinesh\n265\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 266 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nThe adrenergic antagonists (also called adrenergic blockers or sympatholytics) bind to adrenoceptors but do not\ntrigger the usual receptor-mediated intracellular effects. These drugs act by either reversibly or irreversibly attaching\nto the adrenoceptors, thus preventing activation by endogenous or exogenous agonists. Like the agonists, the\nadrenergic antagonists are classified according to their relative affinities for α or β receptors in the sympathetic\nnervous system. Numerous adrenergic antagonists have important roles in clinical medicine, primarily to treat\ndiseases associated with the cardiovascular system. [Note: Antagonists that block dopamine receptors are most\nimportant in the central nervous system (CNS) and are, therefore, considered in that section.] The adrenergic\nantagonists discussed in this chapter are summarized in Figure 7.1.\n266\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 267 ---\n\nFigure 7.1 Summary of blocking agents and drugs affecting neurotransmitter uptake or\nrelease.\n267\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 268 ---\n\n268\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 269 ---\n\nII.  α-Adrenergic Blocking Agents\nα-Adrenergic blocking agents antagonize the subtype(s) of α-adrenergic receptors (α1 or α2), depending on the\nspecificity of the agent for the receptor subtype(s). Drugs that block α1-adrenoceptors profoundly affect blood\npressure. Because normal sympathetic control of the vasculature occurs in large part through agonist actions on α1-\nadrenergic receptors, blockade of these receptors reduces the sympathetic tone of the blood vessels, resulting in\ndecreased peripheral vascular resistance. This lowered blood pressure induces reflex tachycardia. The magnitude of\nthe response depends on the sympathetic tone of the individual when the agent is given. Selective α2-adrenergic\nblockers have limited clinical utility.\n269\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 270 ---\n\nA.  Phenoxybenzamine\nPhenoxybenzamine [fen-ox-ee-BEN-za-meen] is a nonselective, noncompetitive blocker of α1- and α2-adrenergic\nreceptors.\n1.  Actions\na.  Cardiovascular effects\nThe drug prevents α1 receptor vasoconstriction of peripheral blood vessels caused by endogenous catecholamines,\nwhich leads to decreased peripheral resistance and resultant reflex tachycardia. However, by blocking presynaptic α2\nreceptors on the sympathetic nerve terminals in the heart, phenoxybenzamine causes an increase in the release of\nnorepinephrine, which in turn increases heart rate and cardiac output (mediated by β1 receptors). This may also lead\nto cardiac arrhythmias and anginal pain. Thus, the drug has been unsuccessful in maintaining lowered blood\npressure in hypertension, and it is no longer used for this purpose.\nb.  Epinephrine reversal\nAll α-adrenergic blockers reverse the α agonist actions of epinephrine. For example, the vasoconstrictive action of\nepinephrine is interrupted, but vasodilation of other vascular beds caused by stimulation of β2 receptors is not\nblocked. Therefore, in the presence of phenoxybenzamine, the systemic blood pressure decreases in response to\nepinephrine (Figure 7.2). [Note: The actions of norepinephrine are not reversed but are diminished because\nnorepinephrine lacks significant β agonist action on the vasculature.] Phenoxybenzamine has no effect on the actions\nof isoproterenol , which is a pure β agonist (Figure 7.2).\nFigure 7.2 Summary of effects of adrenergic blockers on the changes in blood pressure\ninduced by isoproterenol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine.\n270\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 271 ---\n\n2.  Therapeutic uses\nPhenoxybenzamine is used in the treatment of sweating and hypertension associated with pheochromocytoma, a\ncatecholamine-secreting tumor of cells derived from the adrenal medulla. Phenoxybenzamine is sometimes effective\nin treating Raynaud disease and frostbite.\n3.  Adverse effects\nPhenoxybenzamine can cause postural hypotension, nasal stuffiness, nausea, and vomiting. It may inhibit\nejaculation. It may also induce reflex tachycardia, which is mediated by the baroreceptor reflex. Phenoxybenzamine\nshould be used with caution in patients with cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease.\n271\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 272 ---\n\nB.  Phentolamine\nIn contrast to phenoxybenzamine, phentolamine [fen-TOLE-a-meen] produces a competitive block of α1 and α2\nreceptors. Effects last for approximately 4 hours after a single injection. Pharmacological effects of phentolamine\nare very similar to those of phenoxybenzamine. It is used for the diagnosis and short-term management of\npheochromocytoma. It is also used locally to prevent dermal necrosis following extravasation of norepinephrine.\nPhentolamine is useful to treat hypertensive crisis due to abrupt withdrawal of clonidine or ingestion of tyramine-\ncontaining foods in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors.\n272\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 273 ---\n\nC.  Prazosin, terazosin, and doxazosin\nPrazosin [PRAY-zoe-sin], terazosin [ter-AY-zoe-sin], and doxazosin [dox-AY-zoe-sin] are selective competitive\nblockers of the α1 receptor. In contrast to phenoxybenzamine and phentolamine, they are useful in the treatment of\nhypertension.

Doxazosin is the longest acting of these drugs.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nThese agents decrease peripheral vascular resistance and lower blood pressure by causing relaxation of both arterial\nand venous smooth muscle. Unlike phenoxybenzamine and phentolamine, these drugs cause minimal changes in\ncardiac output, renal blood flow, and glomerular filtration rate. Tamsulosin, alfuzosin, and silodosin have less\npronounced effects on blood pressure because they are less selective for α1B receptors found in the blood vessels and\nmore selective for α1A receptors in the prostate and bladder. Blockade of the α1A receptors decreases tone in the\nsmooth muscle of the bladder neck and prostate and improves urine flow.\n2.  Therapeutic uses\nIndividuals with elevated blood pressure treated with one of these drugs do not become tolerant to its action.\nHowever, the first dose of these drugs may produce an exaggerated orthostatic hypotensive response (Figure 7.3)\nthat can result in syncope (fainting). This action, termed a “first-dose” effect, may be minimized by adjusting the\nfirst dose to one-third or one-fourth of the normal dose and by giving the drug at bedtime. These drugs may cause\nmodest improvement in lipid profiles and glucose metabolism in hypertensive patients. Because of inferior\ncardiovascular outcomes as compared to other antihypertensives, α1 antagonists are not used as monotherapy for the\ntreatment of hypertension (see",

An additive antihypertensive effect occurs when α1 antagonists are given with vasodilators such as\nnitrates or PDE-5 inhibitors (for example, sildenafil ), thereby necessitating cautious dose titration and use at the\nlowest possible doses. These agents may cause “floppy iris syndrome,” a condition in which the iris billows in\nresponse to intraoperative eye surgery.

Yohimbine\nYohimbine [yo-HIM-bean] is a selective competitive α2-blocker that works at the level of the CNS to increase\nsympathetic outflow to the periphery. It is found as a component of the bark of the yohimbe tree (Pausinystalia\nyohimbe) and has been used as a sexual stimulant and in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Its use in the\ntreatment of these disorders is not recommended due to lack of demonstrated efficacy.\n275\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 276 ---\n\nIII.  β-Adrenergic Blocking Agents\nAll of the clinically available β-blockers are competitive antagonists. Nonselective β-blockers act at both β1 and β2\nreceptors, whereas cardioselective β antagonists primarily block β1 receptors. [Note: There are no clinically useful\nβ2 selective antagonists.] These drugs also differ in intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), CNS effects, blockade\nof sympathetic receptors, vasodilation, and pharmacokinetics (Figure 7.5). Although all β-blockers lower blood\npressure, they do not induce postural hypotension, because the α-adrenoceptors remain functional. Therefore, normal\nsympathetic control of the vasculature is maintained. β-Blockers are effective in treating systemic as well as portal\nhypertension, angina, cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, heart failure, hyperthyroidism, and glaucoma.\nThey are also used for the prophylaxis of migraine headaches. [Note: The names of all β-blockers end in “-olol”\nexcept for labetalol  and carvedilol .]\nFigure 7.5 Elimination half-lives for some β-blockers.\n276\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 277 ---\n\nA.  Propranolol: a nonselective β antagonist\nPropranolol  [proe-PRAN-oh-lole] is the prototype β-adrenergic antagonist and blocks both β1 and β2 receptors with\nequal affinity. Sustained-release preparations for once-a-day dosing are available. Nonselective β-blockers,\nincluding propranolol , have the ability to block the actions of isoproterenol  (β1, β2 agonist) on the cardiovascular\nsystem. Thus, in the presence of a β-blocker, isoproterenol  does not produce cardiac stimulation (β1 mediated) or\nreductions in mean arterial pressure and diastolic pressure (β2 mediated; Figure 7.2). [Note: In the presence of a\nnonselective β-blocker, epinephrine no longer lowers diastolic blood pressure or stimulates the heart, but its\nvasoconstrictive action (mediated by α receptors) remains unimpaired. The actions of norepinephrine on the\ncardiovascular system are mediated primarily by α receptors and are, therefore, mostly unaffected.]\n1.  Actions\na.  Cardiovascular\nPropranolol  diminishes cardiac output, having both negative inotropic and chronotropic effects ( Figure 7.6). It\ndirectly depresses sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodal activity. The resulting bradycardia usually limits the dose of\nthe drug. During exercise or stress, when the sympathetic nervous system is activated, β-blockers attenuate the\nexpected increase in heart rate. Cardiac output, workload, and oxygen consumption are decreased by blockade of β1\nreceptors, and these effects are useful in the treatment of angina (see",

Peripheral vasoconstriction\nNonselective blockade of β receptors prevents β2-mediated vasodilation in skeletal muscles, increasing peripheral\nvascular resistance (Figure 7.6). The reduction in cardiac output produced by all β-blockers leads to decreased blood\npressure, which triggers a reflex peripheral vasoconstriction that is reflected in reduced blood flow to the periphery.\nIn patients with hypertension, total peripheral resistance returns to normal or decreases with long-term use of\npropranolol  as a result of down regulation of the β receptors. There is a gradual reduction of both systolic and\ndiastolic blood pressures in hypertensive patients.\nc.  Bronchoconstriction\nBlocking β2 receptors in the lungs of susceptible patients causes contraction of the bronchiolar smooth muscle\n(Figure 7.6). This can precipitate an exacerbation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or\nasthma. Therefore, β-blockers, particularly nonselective ones, are contraindicated in patients with asthma and should\nbe avoided in COPD.\nd.  Disturbances in glucose metabolism\nβ-Blockade leads to decreased glycogenolysis and decreased glucagon secretion. Therefore, if propranolol  is given\nto a diabetic patient receiving insulin, careful monitoring of blood glucose is essential, because pronounced\nhypoglycemia may occur after insulin injection. β-Blockers also attenuate the normal physiologic response to\nhypoglycemia. [Note: Diaphoresis with hypoglycemia still occurs, as this is mediated through the neurotransmitter\nacetylcholine.]\n2.  Therapeutic uses\na.  Hypertension\nPropranolol  does not reduce blood pressure in people with normal blood pressure. Propranolol  lowers blood\npressure in hypertension by several different mechanisms of action. Decreased cardiac output is the primary\nmechanism, but inhibition of renin release from the kidney, decrease in total peripheral resistance with long-term\nuse, and decreased sympathetic outflow from the CNS also contribute to the antihypertensive effects (see Chapter\n16).\nb.  Angina pectoris\nPropranolol  decreases the oxygen requirement of heart muscle and, therefore, is effective in reducing chest pain on\nexertion that is common in angina. Propranolol  is therefore useful in the management of chronic stable angina.\nc.  Myocardial infarction\nPropranolol  and other β-blockers have a protective effect on the myocardium. Thus, patients who have had one\nmyocardial infarction seem to be protected against a second heart attack by prophylactic use of β-blockers. In\naddition, administration of a β-blocker immediately following a myocardial infarction reduces infarct size and early\nmortality. The mechanism for these effects may be a reduction in the actions of circulating catecholamines that\nincrease the oxygen demand in an already ischemic heart muscle. Propranolol  also reduces the incidence of sudden\narrhythmic death after myocardial infarction.\nd.  Migraine\nPropranolol  is effective in reducing migraine episodes when used prophylactically (see",

        "content": "Chapter 37). It is one of the\nmore useful β-blockers for this indication, due to its lipophilic nature that allows it to penetrate the CNS. [Note: For\nthe acute management of migraine, serotonin agonists such as sumatriptan are used, as well as other drugs.]\ne.  Hyperthyroidism\nPropranolol  and other β-blockers are effective in blunting the widespread sympathetic stimulation that occurs in\nhyperthyroidism. In acute hyperthyroidism (thyroid storm), β-blockers may be lifesaving in protecting against\nserious cardiac arrhythmias.\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\nAfter oral administration, propranolol  is almost completely absorbed. It is subject to first-pass effect, and only about\n25% of an administered dose reaches the circulation. The volume of distribution of propranolol  is quite large (4\nL/kg), and the drug readily crosses the blood–brain barrier due to its high lipophilicity. Propranolol  is extensively\nmetabolized, and most metabolites are excreted in the urine.\n4.  Adverse effects\na.  Bronchoconstriction\nPropranolol  has the potential to cause significant bronchoconstriction due to blockade of β2 receptors (Figure 7.7).\nDeath by asphyxiation has been reported for patients with asthma who inadvertently received the drug. Therefore,\npropranolol  is contraindicated in patients with COPD or asthma.279\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 280 ---\n\nFigure 7.7 Adverse effects commonly observed in individuals treated with propranolol.\nb.  Arrhythmias\nTreatment with β-blockers must never be stopped abruptly because of the risk of precipitating cardiac arrhythmias,\nwhich may be severe. The β-blockers must be tapered off gradually over a period of at least a few weeks. Long-term\ntreatment with a β antagonist leads to up-regulation of the β receptor. On suspension of therapy, the increased\nreceptors can precipitate worsened angina or hypertension through action of endogenous catecholamines on the up-\nregulated β receptors.\nc.  Sexual impairment\nImpaired sexual activity has been reported in male patients taking propranolol . The reasons for this are not clear and\nmay be independent of β receptor blockade. However, β-blockers do not affect ejaculation (mediated by α\nreceptors).\nd.  Metabolic disturbances 280\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 281 ---\n\nβ-Blockade leads to decreased glycogenolysis and decreased glucagon secretion. Fasting hypoglycemia may occur.\nIn addition, β-blockers can prevent the counterregulatory effects of catecholamines during hypoglycemia. Thus, the\nperception of symptoms of hypoglycemia such as tremor, tachycardia, and nervousness are blunted by β-blockers. A\nmajor role of β receptors is to mobilize energy molecules such as free fatty acids. [Note: Lipases in fat cells are\nactivated mainly by β receptor stimulation, leading to the metabolism of triglycerides into free fatty acids.] Patients\nadministered nonselective β-blockers may have increased triglycerides and reduced high-density lipoprotein (“good”\ncholesterol) through β-blockade. These effects on the serum lipid profile may be less pronounced with the use of β1-\nselective antagonists such as metoprolol .\ne.  CNS effects\nPropranolol  has numerous CNS-mediated effects, including depression, dizziness, lethargy, fatigue, weakness,\nvisual disturbances, hallucinations, short-term memory loss, emotional lability, vivid dreams (including nightmares),\nand depression. Fewer CNS effects may be seen with more hydrophilic β-blockers (for example, atenolol ) because\nthey do not cross the blood–brain barrier as readily.\nf.  Drug interactions\nDrugs that interfere with, or inhibit, the metabolism of propranolol , such as cimetidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and\nritonavir, may potentiate its antihypertensive effects. Conversely, those that stimulate or induce its metabolism, such\nas barbiturates, phenytoin, and rifampin, can decrease its effects. Nonselective β-blockers such as propranolol  may\nprevent the rescue effects of epinephrine in anaphylaxis.\n281\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 282 ---\n\nB.  Nadolol and timolol: nonselective β antagonists\nNadolol  [NAH-doh-lole] and timolol  [TIM-o-lole] also block β1- and β2-adrenoceptors and are more potent than\npropranolol . Nadolol  has a very long duration of action (Figure 7.5). Timolol  reduces the production of aqueous\nhumor in the eye. It is used topically in the treatment of chronic open-angle glaucoma.\n1.  Treatment of glaucoma\nβ-Blockers, such as topically applied timolol , are effective in diminishing intraocular pressure in glaucoma (Figure\n7.8). This occurs by decreasing the secretion of aqueous humor by the ciliary body. Carteolol  [kar-TEE-oh-lol],\nlevobunolol  [lee-voe-BYOO-noe-lole], and metipranolol  [met-i-PRAN-oh-lol] are nonselective β antagonists,\nwhereas betaxolol  [be-TAKS-oh-lol] is a β1-selective agent. Unlike the cholinergic drugs, these agents neither affect\nthe ability of the eye to focus for near vision nor change pupil size. When administered intraocularly, the onset is\nabout 30 minutes, and the effects last for 12 to 24 hours. The β-blockers are only used for chronic management of\nglaucoma. In an acute attack of glaucoma, pilocarpine is still the drug of choice for emergency lowering of\nintraocular pressure. Other agents used in the treatment of glaucoma are summarized in Figure 7.8.\nFigure 7.8 Classes of drugs used to treat glaucoma.\n282\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 283 ---\n\nC.  Acebutolol, atenolol, betaxolol, bisoprolol, esmolol, metoprolol,\nand nebivolol: selective β 1 antagonists\nDrugs that preferentially block the β1 receptors minimize the unwanted bronchoconstriction (β2 effect) seen with use\nof nonselective agents in asthma patients. Cardioselective β-blockers, such as acebutolol  [a-se-BYOO-toe-lole],\natenolol  [a-TEN-oh-lole], and metoprolol  [me-TOE-proe-lole], antagonize β1 receptors at doses 50- to 100-fold less\nthan those required to block β2 receptors. This cardioselectivity is most pronounced at low doses and is lost at high\ndoses. [Note: Because β1 selectivity of these agents is lost at high doses, they may antagonize β2 receptors.]\n1.  Actions\nThese drugs lower blood pressure in hypertension and increase exercise tolerance in angina (Figure 7.6). Esmolol\n[EZ-moe-lole] has a very short half-life (Figure 7.5) due to metabolism of an ester linkage. It is only available\nintravenously and is used to control blood pressure or heart rhythm in critically ill patients and those undergoing\nsurgery or diagnostic procedures. In addition to its cardioselective β-blockade, nebivolol  [ne-BIV-oh-lole] releases\nnitric oxide from endothelial cells and causes vasodilation. In contrast to propranolol , the cardioselective β-blockers\nhave fewer effects on pulmonary function, peripheral resistance, and carbohydrate metabolism. Nevertheless, asthma\npatients treated with these agents must be carefully monitored to make certain that respiratory activity is not\ncompromised. Because these drugs have less effect on peripheral vascular β2 receptors, coldness of extremities\n(Raynaud phenomenon), a common side effect of β-blockers, is less frequent.\n2.  Therapeutic uses\nThe cardioselective β-blockers are useful in hypertensive patients with impaired pulmonary function. These agents\nare also first-line therapy for chronic stable angina. Bisoprolol  and the extended-release formulation of metoprolol\nare indicated for the management of chronic heart failure.\n283\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 284 ---\n\nD.  Acebutolol and pindolol: antagonists with partial agonist\nactivity\n1.  Actions\na.  Cardiovascular\nAcebutolol  (β1-selective antagonist) and pindolol  (nonselective β-blocker) [PIN-doe-lole] are not pure antagonists.\nThese drugs can also weakly stimulate both β1 and β2 receptors (Figure 7.9) and are said to have ISA. These partial\nagonists stimulate the β receptor to which they are bound, yet they inhibit stimulation by the more potent\nendogenous catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine. The result of these opposing actions is a diminished\neffect on reduction of cardiac rate and cardiac output compared to that of β-blockers without ISA.\n284\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 285 ---\n\n285\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 286 ---\n\nFigure 7.9 Comparison of agonists, antagonists, and partial agonists of β-adrenoceptors.\nb.  Decreased metabolic effects\nβ-Blockers with ISA minimize the disturbances of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism that are seen with other β-\nblockers. For example, these agents do not decrease plasma HDL levels.\n2.  Therapeutic use\nβ-Blockers with ISA are effective in hypertensive patients with moderate bradycardia, because a further decrease in\nheart rate is less pronounced with these drugs. [Note: β-blockers with ISA are not used for stable angina or\narrhythmias due to their partial agonist effect.] Overall, β-blockers with ISA are infrequently used in clinical\npractice. Figure 7.10 summarizes some of the indications for β-blockers.\n286\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 287 ---\n\n287\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 288 ---\n\nFigure 7.10 Some clinical applications of β-blockers. AV = atrioventricular.\n288\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 289 ---\n\nE.  Labetalol and carvedilol: antagonists of both α- and β-\nadrenoceptors\n1.  Actions\nLabetalol  [lah-BET-a-lole] and carvedilol  [CAR-ve-dil-ol] are nonselective β-blockers with concurrent α1-blocking\nactions that produce peripheral vasodilation, thereby reducing blood pressure. They contrast with the other β-\nblockers that produce initial peripheral vasoconstriction, and these agents are, therefore, useful in treating\nhypertensive patients for whom increased peripheral vascular resistance is undesirable. Carvedilol  also decreases\nlipid peroxidation and vascular wall thickening, effects that have benefit in heart failure.\n2.  Therapeutic use in hypertension and heart failure\nLabetalol  is used as an alternative to methyldopa in the treatment of pregnancy-induced hypertension. Intravenous\nlabetalol  is also used to treat hypertensive emergencies, because it can rapidly lower blood pressure (see Chapter\n16). β-Blockers should not be given to patients with an acute exacerbation of heart failure, as they can worsen the\ncondition. However, carvedilol  as well as metoprolol  and bisoprolol  are beneficial in patients with stable chronic\nheart failure. These agents work by blocking the effects of sympathetic stimulation on the heart, which causes\nworsening heart failure over time (see",

Drugs Affecting Neurotransmitter Release or Uptake\nSome agents act on the adrenergic neuron, either to interfere with neurotransmitter release from storage vesicles or\nto alter the uptake of the neurotransmitter into the adrenergic neuron. However, due to the advent of newer and more\neffective agents with fewer side effects, these agents are seldom used therapeutically. Reserpine [re-SER-peen] is\none of the remaining agents in this category.\nReserpine, a plant alkaloid, blocks the Mg2+/adenosine triphosphate–dependent transport of biogenic amines\n(norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin) from the cytoplasm into storage vesicles in the adrenergic nerve\nterminals in all body tissues. This causes the ultimate depletion of biogenic amines. Sympathetic function, in\ngeneral, is impaired because of decreased release of norepinephrine. Reserpine has a slow onset, a long duration of\naction, and effects that persist for many days after discontinuation. It has been used for the management of\nhypertension but has largely been replaced with newer agents with better side effect profiles and fewer drug\ninteractions. It is also indicated in agitated psychotic states such as schizophrenia to relieve symptoms.\n290\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 291 ---\n\n7.1\n7.2\n7.3\n7.4\n7.5Study Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nA 60-year-old patient started a new antihypertensive medication. His blood pressure is well controlled, but\nhe complains of fatigue, drowsiness, and fainting when he gets up from the bed (orthostatic hypotension).\nWhich of the following drugs is he most likely taking?\nA.  Metoprolol\nB.  Propranolol\nC.  Prazosin\nD.  Alfuzosin\nCorrect answer = C. Because they block α1-mediated vasoconstriction, α-blockers (prazosin) are more likely to\ncause orthostatic hypotension, as compared to β-blockers (metoprolol, propranolol). Alfuzosin is a more selective\nantagonist for α1A receptors in the prostate and bladder and is less likely to cause hypotension than prazosin.\nA 30-year-old male patient was brought to the ER with amphetamine overdose. He presented with high\nblood pressure and arrhythmias. Which drug is the most appropriate to treat the cardiovascular symptoms of\namphetamine overdose in this patient?\nA.  Metoprolol\nB.  Prazosin\nC.  Labetalol\nD.  Nebivolol\nCorrect answer = C. Amphetamine is an indirect adrenergic agonist that mainly enhances the release of\nnorepinephrine from peripheral sympathetic neurons. Therefore, it activates all types of adrenergic receptors (that\nis, α and β receptors) and causes an increase in blood pressure. Since both α and β receptors are activated\nindirectly by amphetamine, α-blockers (prazosin) or β-blockers (metoprolol, nebivolol) alone cannot relieve the\ncardiovascular effects of amphetamine poisoning. Labetalol blocks both α1 and beta receptors and can minimize\nthe cardiovascular effects of amphetamine overdose.\nA new antihypertensive drug was tested in an animal model of hypertension. The drug when given alone\nreduces blood pressure in the animal. Norepinephrine when given in the presence of this drug did not cause\nany significant change in blood pressure or heart rate in the animal. The mechanism of action of the new\ndrug is similar to which of the following agents?\nA.  Doxazosin\nB.  Clonidine\nC.  Atenolol\nD.  Carvedilol\nCorrect answer = D. Norepinephrine activates both α1 and β1 receptors and causes an increase in heart rate and\nblood pressure. A drug that prevents the increase in blood pressure caused by norepinephrine should be similar to\ncarvedilol that antagonizes both α1 and β1 receptors. Doxazosin is an α1 antagonist, clonidine is an α2 agonist, and\natenolol is a β antagonist, and these drugs cannot completely prevent the cardiovascular effects of norepinephrine.\nA β-blocker was prescribed for hypertension in a patient with asthma. After a week of treatment, the asthma\nattacks got worse, and the patient was asked to stop taking the β-blocker. Which β-blocker would you\nsuggest as an alternative that is less likely to worsen the asthma?\nA.  Propranolol\nB.  Metoprolol\nC.  Labetalol\nD.  Carvedilol\nCorrect answer = B. The patient was most likely given a nonselective β-blocker (antagonizes both β1 and β2\nreceptors) that made the asthma worse due to β2 antagonism. An alternative is to prescribe a cardioselective\n(antagonizes only β1) β-blocker that does not antagonize β2 receptors in the bronchioles. Metoprolol is a\ncardioselective β-blocker. Propranolol, labetalol, and carvedilol are nonselective β-blockers and could worsen the\nasthma.\nA 70-year-old male is treated with doxazosin for overflow incontinence due to his enlarged prostate. He\ncomplains of dizzy spells while getting up from bed at night. Which drug would you suggest as an alternative\nthat may not cause dizziness?\nA.  Propranolol\nB.  Phentolamine\nC.  Tamsulosin\nD.  Terazosin291\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 292 ---\n\n7.6\n7.7\n7.8\n7.9\n7.10Correct answer = C. Dizziness in this elderly patient could be due to orthostatic hypotension caused by doxazosin.\nTamsulosin is an α1 antagonist that is more selective to the α1 receptor subtype (α1A) present in the prostate and\nless selective to the α1 receptor subtype (α1B) present in the blood vessels. Therefore, tamsulosin should not affect\nblood pressure significantly and may not cause dizziness. Terazosin and phentolamine antagonize both these\nsubtypes and cause significant hypotension as a side effect. Propranolol is a nonselective beta-blocker that is not\nindicated in overflow incontinence.\nA 50-year-old male was in anaphylactic shock after being stung by a hornet. The medical team tried to\nreverse the bronchoconstriction and hypotension using epinephrine; however, the patient did not fully\nrespond to the treatment. The patient’s wife mentioned that he is taking a prescription medication for blood\npressure. Which medication is he most likely taking that contributed to a reduced response to epinephrine?\nA.  Doxazosin\nB.  Propranolol\nC.  Metoprolol\nD.  Acebutolol\nCorrect answer = B. Epinephrine reverses hypotension by activating β1 receptors and relieves bronchoconstriction\nby activating β2 receptors in anaphylaxis. Since epinephrine was not effective in reversing hypotension or\nbronchoconstriction in this patient, it could be assumed that the patient was on a nonselective β-blocker\n(propranolol). Doxazosin (α1-blocker), metoprolol, or acebutolol (both β1-selective blockers) would not have\ncompletely prevented the effects of epinephrine.\nWhich of the following is correct regarding α-adrenergic blockers?\nA.  α-Adrenergic blockers are used in the treatment of hypotension in anaphylactic shock.\nB.  α-Adrenergic blockers are used in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).\nC.  α-Adrenergic blockers may cause bradycardia.\nD.  α-Adrenergic blockers reduce the frequency of urination.\nCorrect answer = B. α-Adrenergic blockers are used in the treatment of BPH because of their relaxant effect on\nprostate smooth muscles. Being antihypertensive agents, they are not useful in treating hypotension in\nanaphylaxis. α-Adrenergic blockers generally cause reflex tachycardia (not bradycardia) due to the significant\ndrop in blood pressure caused by them. They increase (not reduce) the frequency of urination by relaxing the\ninternal sphincter of the urinary bladder, which is controlled by α1 receptors.\nWhich of the following is correct regarding β-blockers?\nA.  Treatment with β-blockers should not be stopped abruptly.\nB.  Propranolol is a cardioselective β-blocker.\nC.  Cardioselective β-blockers worsen asthma.\nD.  β-Blockers decrease peripheral resistance by causing vasorelaxation.\nCorrect answer = A. If β-blocker therapy is stopped abruptly, that could cause angina and rebound hypertension.\nThis could be due to the up-regulation of β receptors in the body. β-Blockers do not cause direct vasorelaxation.\nTherefore, they do not decrease peripheral resistance with short-term use. Propranolol is a nonselective β-blocker\n(not cardioselective). Cardioselective β-blockers antagonize only β1 receptors and do not worsen asthma, as they\ndo not antagonize β2 receptors.\nWhich of the following drugs is commonly used topically in the treatment of glaucoma?\nA.  Esmolol\nB.  Timolol\nC.  Silodosin\nD.  Yohimbine\nCorrect answer = B. β-Blockers reduce the formation of aqueous humor in the eye and therefore reduce\nintraocular pressure, thus relieving glaucoma. Timolol is a nonselective β-blocker that is commonly used topically\nto treat glaucoma. Esmolol is a short-acting β-blocker that is used intravenously for hypertension or arrhythmias.\nSilodosin is an α1 antagonist used for BPH, and yohimbine is a α2 antagonist used for sexual dysfunction.\nWhich of the following drugs has the highest potential to worsen orthostatic hypotension when given\ntogether with prazosin?\nA.  Propranolol\nB.  Atenolol\nC.  Nebivolol\nD.  Labetalol\nCorrect answer = D. Labetalol is a nonselective β-blocker with α1-blocking activity. Prazosin causes orthostatic\nhypotension due to its α1-blockade, which could be enhanced by adding labetalol.

Overview\nMost drugs that affect the central nervous system (CNS) act by altering some step in the neurotransmission process.\nDrugs affecting the CNS may act presynaptically by influencing the production, storage, release, or termination of\naction of neurotransmitters. Other agents may activate or block postsynaptic receptors. This chapter provides an\noverview of the CNS, with a focus on those neurotransmitters that are involved in the actions of the clinically useful\nCNS drugs. These concepts are useful in understanding the etiology and treatment strategies for the\nneurodegenerative disorders that respond to drug therapy: Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, multiple sclerosis\n(MS), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Figure 8.1).\n296\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 297 ---\n\nFigure 8.1 Summary of agents used in the treatment of Parkinson disease, Alzheimer\ndisease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n297\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 298 ---\n\nII.

        "content": "Chapter 3. For example, transmission of information in both the CNS and in the periphery involves the release of\nneurotransmitters that diffuse across the synaptic cleft to bind to specific receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. In\nboth systems, the recognition of the neurotransmitter by the membrane receptor of the postsynaptic neuron triggers\nintracellular changes. However, several major differences exist between neurons in the peripheral ANS and those in\nthe CNS. The circuitry of the CNS is more complex than that of the ANS, and the number of synapses in the CNS is\nfar greater. The CNS, unlike the peripheral ANS, contains networks of inhibitory neurons that are constantly active\nin modulating the rate of neuronal transmission. In addition, the CNS communicates through the use of multiple\nneurotransmitters, whereas the ANS uses only two primary neurotransmitters, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine.\n298\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 299 ---\n\nIII.  Synaptic Potentials\nIn the CNS, receptors in most synapses are coupled to ion channels. Binding of the neurotransmitter to the\npostsynaptic membrane receptors results in a rapid but transient opening of ion channels. Open channels allow\nspecific ions inside and outside the cell membrane to flow down their concentration gradients. The resulting change\nin the ionic composition across the membrane of the neuron alters the postsynaptic potential, producing either\ndepolarization or hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic membrane, depending on the specific ions and the direction\nof their movement.\n299\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 300 ---\n\nA.  Excitatory pathways\nNeurotransmitters can be classified as either excitatory or inhibitory, depending on the nature of the action they\nelicit. Stimulation of excitatory neurons causes a movement of ions that results in a depolarization of the\npostsynaptic membrane. These excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) are generated by the following: 1)\nStimulation of an excitatory neuron causes the release of neurotransmitters, such as glutamate or acetylcholine,\nwhich bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell membrane. This causes a transient increase in the permeability of\nsodium (Na+) ions. 2) The influx of Na+ causes a weak depolarization, or EPSP, that moves the postsynaptic\npotential toward its firing threshold. 3) If the number of stimulated excitatory neurons increases, more excitatory\nneurotransmitter is released. This ultimately causes the EPSP depolarization of the postsynaptic cell to pass a\nthreshold, thereby generating an all-or-none action potential. [Note: The generation of a nerve impulse typically\nreflects the activation of synaptic receptors by thousands of excitatory neurotransmitter molecules released from\nmany nerve fibers.] Figure 8.2 shows an example of an excitatory pathway.\nFigure 8.2 Binding of the excitatory neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, causes\n300\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 301 ---\n\ndepolarization of the neuron.\n301\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 302 ---\n\nB.  Inhibitory pathways\nStimulation of inhibitory neurons causes movement of ions that results in a hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic\nmembrane. These inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSP) are generated by the following: 1) Stimulation of\ninhibitory neurons releases neurotransmitters, such as γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or glycine, which bind to\nreceptors on the postsynaptic cell membrane. This causes a transient increase in the permeability of specific ions,\nsuch as potassium (K+) and chloride (Cl−). 2) The influx of Cl− and efflux of K+ cause a weak hyperpolarization, or\nIPSP, that moves the postsynaptic potential away from its firing threshold. This diminishes the generation of action\npotentials. Figure 8.3 shows an example of an inhibitory pathway.\n302\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 303 ---\n\n303\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 304 ---\n\nFigure 8.3 Binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA),\ncauses hyperpolarization of the neuron.\n304\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 305 ---\n\nC.  Combined effects of the EPSP and IPSP\nMost neurons in the CNS receive both EPSP and IPSP input. Thus, several different types of neurotransmitters may\nact on the same neuron, but each binds to its own specific receptor. The overall action is the summation of the\nindividual actions of the various neurotransmitters on the neuron. The neurotransmitters are not uniformly\ndistributed in the CNS but are localized in specific clusters of neurons, the axons of which may synapse with\nspecific regions of the brain. Many neuronal tracts, thus, seem to be chemically coded, and this may offer greater\nopportunity for selective pharmacological modulation of certain neuronal pathways.\n305\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 306 ---\n\nIV.  Neurodegenerative Diseases\nNeurodegenerative diseases of the CNS include Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, MS, and ALS. These\ndevastating illnesses are characterized by the progressive loss of selected neurons in discrete brain areas, resulting in\ncharacteristic disorders of movement, cognition, or both.\n306\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 307 ---\n\nV.  Overview of Parkinson Disease\nParkinsonism is a progressive neurological disorder of muscle movement, characterized by tremors, muscular\nrigidity, bradykinesia, and postural and gait abnormalities. Most cases involve people over the age of 65, among\nwhom the incidence is about 1 in 100 individuals.\n307\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 308 ---\n\nA.  Etiology\nThe cause of Parkinson disease is unknown for most patients. The disease is correlated with destruction of\ndopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra with a consequent reduction of dopamine actions in the corpus\nstriatum, parts of the basal ganglia system that are involved in motor control.\n1.  Substantia nigra\nThe substantia nigra, part of the extrapyramidal system, is the source of dopaminergic neurons (shown in red in\nFigure 8.4) that terminate in the neostriatum. Each dopaminergic neuron makes thousands of synaptic contacts\nwithin the neostriatum and therefore modulates the activity of a large number of cells. These dopaminergic\nprojections from the substantia nigra fire tonically rather than in response to specific muscular movements or\nsensory input. Thus, the dopaminergic system appears to serve as a tonic, sustaining influence on motor activity,\nrather than participating in specific movements.\nFigure 8.4 Role of substantia nigra in Parkinson disease. ACh = acetylcholine; DA =\ndopamine; GABA = γ-aminobutyric acid.\n2.  Neostriatum\nNormally, the neostriatum is connected to the substantia nigra by neurons (shown in orange in Figure 8.4) that\nsecrete the inhibitory transmitter GABA at their termini. In turn, cells of the substantia nigra send neurons back to\nthe neostriatum, secreting the inhibitory transmitter dopamine at their termini. This mutual inhibitory pathway\nnormally maintains a degree of inhibition of both areas. In Parkinson disease, destruction of cells in the substantia\nnigra results in the degeneration of the nerve terminals that secrete dopamine in the neostriatum. Thus, the normal\ninhibitory influence of dopamine on cholinergic neurons in the neostriatum is significantly diminished, resulting in\noverproduction, or a relative overactivity, of acetylcholine by the stimulatory neurons (shown in green in Figure308\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 309 ---\n\n8.4). This triggers a chain of abnormal signaling, resulting in loss of the control of muscle movements.\n3.  Secondary parkinsonism\nDrugs such as the phenothiazines and haloperidol , whose major pharmacologic action is blockade of dopamine\nreceptors in the brain, may produce parkinsonian symptoms (also called pseudoparkinsonism). These drugs should\nbe used with caution in patients with Parkinson disease.\n309\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 310 ---\n\nB.  Strategy of treatment\nIn addition to an abundance of inhibitory dopaminergic neurons, the neostriatum is also rich in excitatory\ncholinergic neurons that oppose the action of dopamine (Figure 8.4). Many of the symptoms of parkinsonism reflect\nan imbalance between the excitatory cholinergic neurons and the greatly diminished number of inhibitory\ndopaminergic neurons. Therapy is aimed at restoring dopamine in the basal ganglia and antagonizing the excitatory\neffect of cholinergic neurons, thus reestablishing the correct dopamine/acetylcholine balance.\n310\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 311 ---\n\nVI.  Drugs Used in Parkinson Disease\nMany currently available drugs aim to maintain CNS dopamine levels, or signaling, as constant as possible. These\nagents offer temporary relief from the symptoms of the disorder, but they do not arrest or reverse the neuronal\ndegeneration caused by the disease.\n311\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 312 ---\n\nA.  Levodopa and carbidopa\nLevodopa [lee-voe-DOE-pa] is a metabolic precursor of dopamine (Figure 8.5). It restores dopaminergic\nneurotransmission in the neostriatum by enhancing the synthesis of dopamine in the surviving neurons of the\nsubstantia nigra. In early disease, the number of residual dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (typically\nabout 20% of normal) is adequate for conversion of levodopa to dopamine. Thus, in new patients, the therapeutic\nresponse to levodopa is consistent, and the patient rarely complains that the drug effects “wear off.” Unfortunately,\nwith time, the number of neurons decreases, and fewer cells are capable of converting exogenously administered\nlevodopa to dopamine. Consequently, motor control fluctuation develops. Relief provided by levodopa is only\nsymptomatic, and it lasts only while the drug is present in the body.\nFigure 8.5 Synthesis of dopamine from levodopa in the absence and presence of\ncarbidopa, an inhibitor of dopamine decarboxylase in the peripheral tissues. (GI =\ngastrointestinal.)\n1.  Mechanism of action\na.  Levodopa\nDopamine does not cross the blood–brain barrier, but its immediate precursor, levodopa, is actively transported into\nthe CNS and converted to dopamine (Figure 8.5). Levodopa must be administered with carbidopa [kar-bi-DOE-pa].\nWithout carbidopa, much of the drug is decarboxylated to dopamine in the periphery, resulting in diminished effect,\nnausea, vomiting, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypotension.\nb.  Carbidopa\nCarbidopa, a dopamine decarboxylase inhibitor, diminishes the metabolism of levodopa in the periphery, thereby\nincreasing the availability of levodopa to the CNS. The addition of carbidopa lowers the dose of levodopa needed\nby four- to five-fold and, consequently, decreases the severity of adverse effects arising from peripherally formed\ndopamine.\n2.  Therapeutic uses\nLevodopa in combination with carbidopa is an efficacious drug regimen for the treatment of Parkinson disease. It\ndecreases rigidity, tremors, and other symptoms of parkinsonism. In approximately two-thirds of patients with\nParkinson disease, levodopa–carbidopa substantially reduces the severity of symptoms for the first few years of\ntreatment. Patients typically experience a decline in response during the 3rd to 5th year of therapy. Withdrawal from\nthe drug must be gradual.\n3.  Absorption and metabolism\nThe drug is absorbed rapidly from the small intestine (when empty of food). Levodopa has an extremely short half-\nlife (1 to 2 hours), which causes fluctuations in plasma concentration. This may produce fluctuations in motor\nresponse, which generally correlate with the plasma concentration of levodopa, or perhaps give rise to the more\ntroublesome “on–off” phenomenon, in which the motor fluctuations are not related to plasma levels in a simple way.\nMotor fluctuations may cause the patient to suddenly lose normal mobility and experience tremors, cramps, and\nimmobility. Ingestion of meals, particularly if high in protein, interferes with the transport of levodopa into the CNS.\nThus, levodopa should be taken on an empty stomach, typically 30 minutes before a meal.\n4.  Adverse effects312\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 313 ---\n\na.  Peripheral effects\nAnorexia, nausea, and vomiting occur because of stimulation of the chemoreceptor trigger zone ( Figure 8.6).\nTachycardia and ventricular extrasystole result from dopaminergic action on the heart. Hypotension may also\ndevelop. Adrenergic action on the iris causes mydriasis. In some individuals, blood dyscrasias and a positive\nreaction to the Coombs test are seen. Saliva and urine may turn brownish color because of the melanin pigment\nproduced from catecholamine oxidation.\n313\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 314 ---\n\nFigure 8.6 Adverse effects of levodopa.\nb.  CNS effects\n314\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 315 ---\n\nVisual and auditory hallucinations and abnormal involuntary movements (dyskinesias) may occur. These effects are\nthe opposite of parkinsonian symptoms and reflect overactivity of dopamine in the basal ganglia. Levodopa can also\ncause mood changes, depression, psychosis, and anxiety.\n5.  Interactions\nThe vitamin pyridoxine (B6) increases the peripheral breakdown of levodopa and diminishes its effectiveness\n(Figure 8.7). Concomitant administration of levodopa and nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs),\nsuch as phenelzine, can produce a hypertensive crisis caused by enhanced catecholamine production. Therefore,\nconcomitant administration of these agents is contraindicated. In many psychotic patients, levodopa exacerbates\nsymptoms, possibly through the buildup of central catecholamines. Cardiac patients should be carefully monitored\nfor the possible development of arrhythmias. Antipsychotic drugs are generally contraindicated in Parkinson disease,\nbecause they potently block dopamine receptors and may augment parkinsonian symptoms. However, low doses of\natypical antipsychotics, such as quetiapine or clozapine, are sometimes used to treat levodopa-induced psychotic\nsymptoms.\nFigure 8.7 Some drug interactions observed with levodopa. MAO = monoamine oxidase.\n315\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 316 ---\n\nB.  Selegiline, rasagiline, and safinamide\nSelegiline [seh-LEDGE-ah-leen], also called deprenyl  [DE-pre-nill], selectively inhibits monoamine oxidase (MAO)\ntype B, the enzyme that metabolizes dopamine. It does not inhibit MAO type A (metabolizes norepinephrine and\nserotonin) unless given above recommended doses, where it loses its selectivity. By decreasing the metabolism of\ndopamine, selegiline increases dopamine levels in the brain (Figure 8.8). When selegiline is administered with\nlevodopa, it enhances the actions of levodopa and substantially reduces the required dose. Unlike nonselective\nMAOIs, selegiline at recommended doses has little potential for causing hypertensive crises. However, the drug\nloses selectivity at high doses, and there is a risk for severe hypertension. Selegiline is metabolized to\nmethamphetamine and amphetamine, whose stimulating properties may produce insomnia if the drug is\nadministered later than mid-afternoon. Rasagiline [ra-SA-gi-leen], an irreversible and selective inhibitor of brain\nMAO type B, has five times the potency of selegiline. Unlike selegiline, rasagiline is not metabolized to an\namphetamine-like substance. Safinamide [sa-FIN-a-mide] is also a selective inhibitor of MAO type B indicated for\nuse as an adjunct to levodopa–carbidopa.\nFigure 8.8 Action of selegiline (deprenyl) in dopamine metabolism. (MAO B =\nmonoamine oxidase type B.)\n316\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 317 ---\n\nC.  Catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors\nNormally, the methylation of levodopa by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) to 3-O-methyldopa is a minor\npathway for levodopa metabolism. However, when peripheral dopamine decarboxylase activity is inhibited by\ncarbidopa, a significant concentration of 3-O-methyldopa is formed that competes with levodopa for active transport\ninto the CNS (Figure 8.9). Entacapone [en-TAK-a-pone] and tolcapone [TOLE-ka-pone] selectively and reversibly\ninhibit COMT. Inhibition of COMT by these agents leads to decreased plasma concentrations of 3-O-methyldopa,\nincreased central uptake of levodopa, and greater concentrations of brain dopamine. Both of these agents reduce the\nsymptoms of “wearing-off” phenomena seen in patients on levodopa–carbidopa. The two drugs differ primarily in\ntheir pharmacokinetic and adverse effect profiles.\nFigure 8.9 Effect of entacapone on dopa concentration in the central nervous system\n(CNS). COMT = catechol-O- methyltransferase.\n1.  Pharmacokinetics\nOral absorption of both drugs occurs readily and is not influenced by food. They are extensively bound to plasma\nalbumin, with a limited volume of distribution. Tolcapone has a relatively long duration of action (probably due to\nits affinity for the enzyme) compared to entacapone, which requires more frequent dosing. Both drugs are\nextensively metabolized and eliminated in feces and urine. The dosage may need to be adjusted in patients with\nmoderate or severe cirrhosis.\n2.  Adverse effects\nBoth drugs exhibit adverse effects that are observed in patients taking levodopa–carbidopa, including diarrhea,\npostural hypotension, nausea, anorexia, dyskinesias, hallucinations, and sleep disorders. Most seriously, fulminating\nhepatic necrosis is associated with tolcapone use. Therefore, it should be used, along with appropriate hepatic\nfunction monitoring, only in patients in whom other modalities have failed. Entacapone does not exhibit this toxicity\nand has largely replaced tolcapone in clinical practice.\n317\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 318 ---\n\nD.  Dopamine receptor agonists\nThis group of antiparkinsonian compounds includes bromocriptine [broe-moe-KRIP-teen], an ergot derivative, and\nthe nonergot drugs, ropinirole [roe-PIN-i-role], pramipexole [pra-mi-PEX-ole], rotigotine [ro-TIG-oh-teen], and\napomorphine [A-poe-more-feen]. These agents have a longer duration of action than that of levodopa and are\neffective in patients exhibiting fluctuations in response to levodopa. Initial therapy with these drugs is associated\nwith less risk of developing dyskinesias and motor fluctuations as compared to patients started on levodopa.\nBromocriptine, pramipexole, and ropinirole are effective in patients with Parkinson disease complicated by motor\nfluctuations and dyskinesias. However, these drugs are ineffective in patients who have not responded to levodopa.\nApomorphine is an injectable dopamine agonist that is used in severe and advanced stages of the disease to\nsupplement oral medications. Adverse effects severely limit the utility of the dopamine agonists (Figure 8.10).\n318\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 319 ---\n\nFigure 8.10 Some adverse effects of dopamine agonists.\n1.  Bromocriptine\n319\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 320 ---\n\nThe actions of the ergot derivative bromocriptine are similar to those of levodopa, except that hallucinations,\nconfusion, delirium, nausea, and orthostatic hypotension are more common, whereas dyskinesia is less prominent. In\npsychiatric illness, bromocriptine may cause the mental condition to worsen. It should be used with caution in\npatients with a history of myocardial infarction or peripheral vascular disease due to the risk of vasospasm. Because\nbromocriptine is an ergot derivative, it has the potential to cause pulmonary and retroperitoneal fibrosis.\n2.  Apomorphine, pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine\nThese are nonergot dopamine agonists that are approved for the treatment of Parkinson disease. Ropinirole is also\nindicated for the treatment of restless legs syndrome. Pramipexole and ropinirole are orally active agents.\nApomorphine and rotigotine are available in injectable and transdermal delivery systems, respectively. Apomorphine\nis used for acute management of the hypomobility “off” phenomenon in advanced Parkinson disease. Rotigotine is\nadministered as a once-daily transdermal patch that provides even drug levels over 24 hours. These agents alleviate\nthe motor deficits in patients who have never taken levodopa and also in patients with advanced Parkinson disease\nwho are treated with levodopa. Dopamine agonists may delay the need to use levodopa in early Parkinson disease\nand may decrease the dose of levodopa in advanced Parkinson disease. Unlike the ergotamine derivatives, these\nagents do not exacerbate peripheral vascular disorders or cause fibrosis. Nausea, hallucinations, insomnia, dizziness,\nconstipation, and orthostatic hypotension are adverse effects of these drugs, but dyskinesias are less frequent than\nwith levodopa (Figure 8.11). Pramipexole is mainly excreted unchanged in the urine, and dosage adjustments are\nneeded in renal dysfunction. The fluoroquinolone antibiotics and other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450)\n1A2 isoenzyme (for example, fluvoxamine) may inhibit the metabolism of ropinirole, requiring an adjustment in\nropinirole dosage. Figure 8.12 summarizes some properties of dopamine agonists.\n320\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 321 ---\n\nFigure 8.11 Motor complications in patients treated with levodopa or dopamine agonists.\nFigure 8.12 Pharmacokinetic properties of dopamine agonists pramipexole , ropinirole ,\nand rotigotine.

Amantadine\nIt was accidentally discovered that the antiviral drug amantadine [a-MAN-ta-deen] has an antiparkinsonian action.\nAmantadine has several effects on a number of neurotransmitters implicated in parkinsonism, including increasing\nthe release of dopamine, blocking cholinergic receptors, and inhibiting the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type of\nglutamate receptors. The drug may cause restlessness, agitation, confusion, and hallucinations, and, at high doses, it\nmay induce acute toxic psychosis. Orthostatic hypotension, urinary retention, peripheral edema, and dry mouth also\nmay occur. Amantadine is less efficacious than levodopa, and tolerance develops more readily. However,\namantadine has fewer adverse effects.\n323\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 324 ---\n\nF.  Antimuscarinic agents\nThe antimuscarinic agents are much less efficacious than levodopa and play only an adjuvant role in\nantiparkinsonism therapy. The actions of benztropine [BENZ-troe-peen] and trihexyphenidyl  [tri-hex-ee-FEN-i-dill]\nare similar, although individual patients may respond more favorably to one drug or the other. Blockade of\ncholinergic transmission produces effects similar to augmentation of dopaminergic transmission, since it helps to\ncorrect the imbalance in the dopamine/acetylcholine activity (Figure 8.4). These agents can induce mood changes\nand confusion, and produce xerostomia, constipation, and visual problems typical of muscarinic blockers (see",

They interfere with gastrointestinal peristalsis and are contraindicated in patients with glaucoma,\nprostatic hyperplasia, or pyloric stenosis.\n324\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 325 ---\n\nVII.  Drugs Used in Alzheimer Disease\nDementia of the Alzheimer type has three distinguishing features: 1) accumulation of senile plaques (β-amyloid\naccumulations), 2) formation of numerous neurofibrillary tangles, and 3) loss of cortical neurons, particularly\ncholinergic neurons. Current therapies aim to either improve cholinergic transmission within the CNS or prevent\nexcitotoxic actions resulting from overstimulation of NMDA-glutamate receptors in selected areas of the brain.\nPharmacologic intervention for Alzheimer disease is only palliative and provides modest short-term benefit. None of\nthe available therapeutic agents alter the underlying neurodegenerative process.\n325\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 326 ---\n\nA.  Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors\nNumerous studies have linked the progressive loss of cholinergic neurons and, presumably, cholinergic transmission\nwithin the cortex to the memory loss that is a hallmark symptom of Alzheimer disease. It is postulated that inhibition\nof acetylcholinesterase (AChE) within the CNS improves cholinergic transmission, at least at those neurons that are\nstill functioning. The reversible AChE inhibitors approved for the treatment of Alzheimer disease include donepezil\n[doe-NE-peh-zil], galantamine [ga-LAN-ta-meen], and rivastigmine [ri-va-STIG-meen]. These agents have some\nselectivity for AChE in the CNS, as compared to the periphery. Galantamine may also augment the action of\nacetylcholine at nicotinic receptors in the CNS. At best, these compounds may provide a modest reduction in the\nrate of loss of cognitive functioning in Alzheimer patients. Rivastigmine is the only agent approved for the\nmanagement of dementia associated with Parkinson disease and also the only AChE inhibitor available as a\ntransdermal formulation. Rivastigmine is hydrolyzed by AChE to a carbamylated metabolite and has no interactions\nwith drugs that alter the activity of CYP450 enzymes. The other agents are substrates for CYP450 and have a\npotential for such interactions. Common adverse effects include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia, tremors,\nbradycardia, and muscle cramps (Figure 8.13).\n326\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 327 ---\n\n327\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 328 ---\n\nFigure 8.13 Adverse effects of AChE inhibitors.\n328\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 329 ---\n\nB.  NMDA receptor antagonist\nStimulation of glutamate receptors in the CNS appears to be critical for the formation of certain memories.\nHowever, overstimulation of glutamate receptors, particularly of the NMDA type, may result in excitotoxic effects\non neurons and is suggested as a mechanism for neurodegenerative or apoptotic (programmed cell death) processes.\nBinding of glutamate to the NMDA receptor assists in the opening of an ion channel that allows Ca2+ to enter the\nneuron. Excess intracellular Ca2+ can activate a number of processes that ultimately damage neurons and lead to\napoptosis. Memantine [meh-MAN-teen] is an NMDA receptor antagonist indicated for moderate to severe\nAlzheimer disease. It acts by blocking the NMDA receptor and limiting Ca2+ influx into the neuron, such that toxic\nintracellular levels are not achieved. Memantine is well tolerated, with few dose-dependent adverse events. Expected\nadverse effects, such as confusion, agitation, and restlessness, are often indistinguishable from the symptoms of\nAlzheimer disease. Given its different mechanism of action and possible neuroprotective effects, memantine is often\ngiven in combination with an AChE inhibitor.\n329\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 330 ---\n\nVIII.  Drugs Used in Multiple Sclerosis\nMS is an autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS. The course of MS is variable. For some, MS\nmay consist of one or two acute neurologic episodes. In others, it is a chronic, relapsing, or progressive disease that\nmay span 10 to 20 years. Historically, corticosteroids (for example, dexamethasone and prednisone) have been used\nto treat acute exacerbations of the disease. Chemotherapeutic agents, such as cyclophosphamide and azathioprine,\nhave also been used.\n330\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 331 ---\n\nA.  Disease-modifying therapies\nDrugs currently approved for MS are indicated to decrease relapse rates or, in some cases, to prevent accumulation\nof disability. The major target of these medications is to modify the immune response through inhibition of white\nblood cell–mediated inflammatory processes that eventually lead to myelin sheath damage and decreased or\ninappropriate axonal communication between cells.\n1.  Interferon b 1a and interferon b 1b\nThe immunomodulatory effects of interferon [in-ter-FEER-on] help to diminish the inflammatory responses that\nlead to demyelination of the axon sheaths. Adverse effects of these medications may include depression, local\ninjection site reactions, increases in hepatic enzymes, and flu-like symptoms.\n2.  Glatiramer\nGlatiramer [gluh-TEER-a-mur] is a synthetic polypeptide that resembles myelin protein and may act as a decoy to\nT-cell attack. Some patients experience a postinjection reaction that includes flushing, chest pain, anxiety, and\nitching. It is usually self-limiting.\n3.  Fingolimod\nFingolimod [fin-GO-li-mod] is an oral drug that alters lymphocyte migration, resulting in fewer lymphocytes in the\nCNS. Fingolimod may cause first-dose bradycardia and is associated with an increased risk of infection and macular\nedema.\n4.  Teriflunomide\nTeriflunomide [te-ree-FLOO-no-mide] is an oral pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor that leads to a lower concentration of\nactive lymphocytes in the CNS. Teriflunomide may cause elevated liver enzymes. It should be avoided in pregnancy.\n5.  Dimethyl fumarate\nDimethyl fumarate [dye-METH-il FOO-ma-rate] is an oral agent that may alter the cellular response to oxidative\nstress to reduce disease progression. Flushing and abdominal pain are the most common adverse events.\n6.  Monoclonal antibodies\nAlemtuzumab [AL-em-TOOZ-ue-mab], daclizumab [dah-KLIH-zyoo-mab], natalizumab [na-ta-LIZ-oo-mab], and\nocrelizumab [OK-re-LIZ-ue-mab] are monoclonal antibodies indicated for the treatment of MS. Ocrelizumab is the\nfirst agent to be approved for primary progressive forms of the disease. These agents can be associated with\nsignificant toxicities, such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy with natalizumab, serious infections with\ndaclizumab and alemtuzumab, and autoimmune disorders with alemtuzumab. As such, these agents may be reserved\nfor patients who have failed other therapies.\n331\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 332 ---\n\nB.  Symptomatic treatment\nMany different classes of drugs are used to manage symptoms of MS such as spasticity, constipation, bladder\ndysfunction, and depression. Dalfampridine [DAL-fam-pre-deen], an oral potassium channel blocker, improves\nwalking speeds in patients with MS. It is the first drug approved for this use.\n332\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 333 ---\n\nIX.  Drugs Used in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis\nALS is characterized by progressive degeneration of motor neurons, resulting in the inability to initiate or control\nmuscle movement. Riluzole [RIL-ue-zole] and edaravone [e-DAR-a-vone] are indicated for the management of\nALS. Riluzole, an oral NMDA receptor antagonist, is believed to act by inhibiting glutamate release and blocking\nsodium channels. Riluzole may improve survival time in patients suffering from ALS. Edaravone is an intravenous\nfree radical scavenger and antioxidant that may slow the progression of ALS.\n333\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 334 ---\n\n8.1\n8.2\n8.3\n8.4\n8.5\n8.6Study Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nA 75-year-old man with moderate Parkinson disease is no longer responding to anticholinergic treatment for\nhis tremors and bradykinesia. Which combination of antiparkinsonian drugs is an appropriate treatment plan?\nA.  Amantadine, carbidopa, and entacapone\nB.  Levodopa, carbidopa, and entacapone\nC.  Pramipexole, carbidopa, and entacapone\nD.  Ropinirole, carbidopa, and selegiline\nCorrect answer = B. To reduce the dose of levodopa and its peripheral side effects, the peripheral decarboxylase\ninhibitor, carbidopa, is coadministered. As a result of this combination, more levodopa is available for\nmetabolism by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) to 3-O-methyldopa, which competes with levodopa for the\nactive transport processes into the CNS. By administering entacapone (an inhibitor of COMT), the competing\nproduct is not formed, and more levodopa enters the brain. The other choices are not appropriate because neither\nperipheral decarboxylase, nor COMT, nor monoamine oxidase metabolizes amantadine or the direct-acting\ndopamine agonists ropinirole and pramipexole; thus carbidopa and entacapone should only be given with\nlevodopa, otherwise they are not contributing to the clinical response of the patient.\nPeripheral adverse effects of levodopa, including nausea, hypotension, and cardiac arrhythmias, can be\ndiminished by including which drug in the therapy?\nA.  Amantadine\nB.  Ropinirole\nC.  Carbidopa\nD.  Entacapone\nCorrect answer = C. Carbidopa inhibits the peripheral decarboxylation of levodopa to dopamine, thereby\ndiminishing the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular side effects of levodopa. The other agents listed do not\nameliorate adverse effects of levodopa.\nWhich antiparkinsonian drug may cause vasospasm?\nA.  Amantadine\nB.  Bromocriptine\nC.  Entacapone\nD.  Ropinirole\nCorrect answer = B. Bromocriptine is a dopamine receptor agonist that may cause vasospasm. It is\ncontraindicated in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Ropinirole directly stimulates dopamine receptors,\nbut it does not cause vasospasm. The other drugs do not act directly on dopamine receptors.\nModest improvement in the memory of patients with Alzheimer disease may occur with drugs that increase\ntransmission at which receptor?\nA.  Adrenergic\nB.  Cholinergic\nC.  Dopaminergic\nD.  Serotonergic\nCorrect answer = B. AChE inhibitors, such as galantamine, increase cholinergic transmission in the CNS and may\ncause a modest delay in the progression of Alzheimer disease. Increased transmission at the other types of\nreceptors listed does not result in improved memory.\nA 70-year-old woman with moderate to severe dementia of the Alzheimer type has been treated with an\nacetylcholinesterase inhibitor for 6 months at maximum dosing with minimal effect. Which medication is a\nglutamate receptor antagonist that could provide added benefit for management of her moderate to severe\nsymptoms of Alzheimer disease?\nA.  Rivastigmine\nB.  Pramipexole\nC.  Memantine\nD.  Galantamine\nCorrect answer = C. When combined with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, memantine has modest efficacy in\nkeeping patients with Alzheimer disease at or above baseline for at least 6 months and may delay disease\nprogression.

Rotigotine\nCorrect answer = A. Rivastigmine is the only agent available as a transdermal delivery system (patch) for the\ntreatment of Alzheimer disease. It may also be used for dementia associated with Parkinson disease. Daily use of\nthe rivastigmine patch provides steady drug levels to treat Alzheimer disease, with a possible reduced incidence\nof nausea. Rotigotine is available as a transdermal delivery system; however, it is indicated for Parkinson disease\nand not for Alzheimer disease.\nWhich medication would benefit a 55-year-old female patient recently diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral\nsclerosis (ALS)?\nA.  Pramipexole\nB.  Galantamine\nC.  Riluzole\nD.  Glatiramer\nCorrect answer = C. Riluzole is approved for the debilitating and lethal illness of ALS. It is used to, ideally, delay\nthe progression and need for ventilator support in severe patients. It is believed to work by decreasing the release\nof glutamate from the presynaptic terminal.\nA 48-year-old woman with relapsing multiple sclerosis has had intolerable adverse reactions to interferon\nbeta (depression) and dimethyl fumarate (angioedema) and now requires an alternative treatment option.\nWhich medication is most appropriate for this patient?\nA.  Riluzole\nB.  Rotigotine\nC.  Teriflunomide\nD.  Galantamine\nCorrect answer = C. Teriflunomide is believed to exert its disease modifying and anti-inflammatory effects by\ninhibiting the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase to reduce pyrimidine synthesis. Teriflunomide may provide\nan alternative treatment option with a different side effect profile compared to the prior two attempted treatments.\nThe other agents are not indicated for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.\nWhich agent may cause tremors as an adverse effect and, thus, should be used with caution in patients with\nParkinson disease, even though it is also indicated for the treatment of dementia associated with Parkinson\ndisease?\nA.  Benztropine\nB.  Rotigotine\nC.  Rivastigmine\nD.  Dimethyl fumarate\nCorrect answer = C. Though rivastigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, which can cause tremors as an\nadverse effect, its use is not contraindicated in patients with Parkinson disease, as this agent is also the only\nmedication approved for dementia associated with Parkinson disease. It should be used with caution, as it may\nworsen the parkinsonian-related tremors. A risk–benefit discussion should occur with the patient and the\ncaregiver before rivastigmine is used.\nA 50-year-old male patient with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis reports continued difficulty\nwalking and the distance that he can walk before being overcome by fatigue.

Rey\n336\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 337 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nDisorders involving anxiety are among the most common mental disorders. Anxiety is an unpleasant state of\ntension, apprehension, or uneasiness (a fear that arises from either a known or an unknown source). The physical\nsymptoms of severe anxiety are similar to those of fear (such as tachycardia, sweating, trembling, and palpitations)\nand involve sympathetic activation. Episodes of mild anxiety are common life experiences and do not warrant\ntreatment. However, severe, chronic, debilitating anxiety may be treated with antianxiety drugs (sometimes called\nanxiolytics) and/or some form of psychotherapy. Because many antianxiety drugs also cause some sedation, they\nmay be used clinically as both anxiolytic and hypnotic (sleep-inducing) agents. Figure 9.1 summarizes the anxiolytic\nand hypnotic agents. Some antidepressants are also indicated for certain anxiety disorders; however, they are\ndiscussed with the antidepressants (see",

Benzodiazepines\nBenzodiazepines are widely used anxiolytic drugs. They have largely replaced barbiturates and meprobamate in the\ntreatment of anxiety and insomnia, because benzodiazepines are generally considered to be safer and more effective\n(Figure 9.2). Though benzodiazepines are commonly used, they are not necessarily the best choice for anxiety or\ninsomnia. Certain antidepressants with anxiolytic action, such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),\nare preferred in many cases, and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics and antihistamines may be preferable for insomnia.\nFigure 9.2 Ratio of lethal dose to effective dose for morphine (an opioid, see Chapter\n14), chlorpromazine (an antipsychotic, see",

Mechanism of action\nThe targets for benzodiazepine actions are the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors. [Note: GABA is the major\ninhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS).] The GABAA receptors are composed of a\ncombination of five α, β, and γ subunits that span the postsynaptic membrane (Figure 9.3). For each subunit, many\nsubtypes exist (for example, there are six subtypes of the α subunit). Binding of GABA to its receptor triggers an\nopening of the central ion channel, allowing chloride through the pore. The influx of chloride ions causes\nhyperpolarization of the neuron and decreases neurotransmission by inhibiting the formation of action potentials.\nBenzodiazepines modulate GABA effects by binding to a specific, high-affinity site (distinct from the GABA-\nbinding site) located at the interface of the α subunit and the γ subunit on the GABAA receptor (Figure 9.3).\nBenzodiazepines increase the frequency of channel openings produced by GABA. The clinical effects of individual\nbenzodiazepines correlate well with the binding affinity of each drug for the GABA receptor–chloride ion channel\ncomplex.\nFigure 9.3 Schematic diagram of benzodiazepine–GABA–chloride ion channel complex.\nGABA = γ-aminobutyric acid.\n341\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 342 ---\n\nB.  Actions\nAll benzodiazepines exhibit the following actions to some extent:\n1.  Reduction of anxiety\nAt low doses, the benzodiazepines are anxiolytic. They are thought to reduce anxiety by selectively enhancing\nGABAergic transmission in neurons having the α2 subunit in their GABAA receptors, thereby inhibiting neuronal\ncircuits in the limbic system of the brain.\n2.  Sedative/hypnotic\nAll benzodiazepines have sedative and calming properties, and some can produce hypnosis (artificially produced\nsleep) at higher doses. The hypnotic effects are mediated by the α1-GABAA receptors.\n3.  Anterograde amnesia\nTemporary impairment of memory with the use of the benzodiazepines is also mediated by the α1-GABAA\nreceptors. The ability to learn and form new memories is also impaired.\n4.  Anticonvulsant\nThis effect is partially, although not completely, mediated by α1-GABAA receptors.\n5.  Muscle relaxant\nAt high doses, the benzodiazepines relax the spasticity of skeletal muscle, probably by increasing presynaptic\ninhibition in the spinal cord, where the α2-GABAA receptors are largely located. [Note: Baclofen [BAK-loe-fen] is a\nmuscle relaxant that is believed to affect GABA receptors at the level of the spinal cord.]\n342\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 343 ---\n\nC.  Therapeutic uses\nThe individual benzodiazepines show small differences in their relative anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and sedative\nproperties. However, pharmacokinetic considerations are often important in choosing one benzodiazepine over\nanother.\n1.  Anxiety disorders\nBenzodiazepines are effective for the treatment of anxiety associated with panic disorder, generalized anxiety\ndisorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder, performance anxiety, and extreme phobias, such as fear of flying. The\nbenzodiazepines are also useful in treating anxiety related to depression and schizophrenia. These drugs should be\nreserved for severe anxiety and should not be used to manage the stress of everyday life. Because of their addictive\npotential, they should only be used for short periods of time. The longer-acting agents, such as clonazepam [kloe-\nNAZ-e-pam], lorazepam [lor-AZ-e-pam], and diazepam [dye-AZ-e-pam], are often preferred in patients with\nanxiety that require prolonged treatment. The antianxiety effects of the benzodiazepines are less subject to tolerance\nthan the sedative and hypnotic effects. [Note: Tolerance is decreased responsiveness to repeated doses of the drug\nthat occurs when used for more than 1 to 2 weeks.] For panic disorders, alprazolam [al-PRAY-zoe-lam] is effective\nfor short- and long-term treatment, although it may cause withdrawal reactions in approximately 30% of patients.\n2.  Sleep disorders\nBenzodiazepine hypnotics decrease the latency to sleep onset and increase stage II of non–rapid eye movement\n(REM) sleep. Both REM sleep and slow-wave sleep are decreased. In the treatment of insomnia, it is important to\nbalance the sedative effect needed at bedtime with the residual sedation (“hangover”) upon awakening. Short-acting\ntriazolam [try-AY-zoe-lam] is effective in treating individuals who have problems falling asleep. The risk of\nwithdrawal and rebound insomnia is higher with triazolam than with other agents. Intermediate-acting temazepam\n[te-MAZ-e-pam] is useful for patients who experience frequent awakenings and have difficulty staying asleep.\nTemazepam should be administered 1 to 2 hours before the desired bedtime. Long-acting flurazepam [flure-AZ-e-\npam] is rarely used, due to its extended half-life, which may result in excessive daytime sedation and accumulation\nof the drug, especially in the elderly. Estazolam [eh-STAY-zoe-lam] and quazepam [QUAY-ze-pam] are considered\nintermediate- and long-acting agents, respectively. In general, hypnotics should be used for only a limited time,\nusually 1 to 3 weeks.\n3.  Amnesia\nThe shorter-acting agents are often employed as premedication for anxiety-provoking and unpleasant procedures,\nsuch as endoscopy, dental procedures, and angioplasty. They cause a form of conscious sedation, allowing the\npatient to be receptive to instructions during these procedures. Midazolam [mi-DAY-zoe-lam] is a benzodiazepine\nused to facilitate anterograde amnesia while providing sedation prior to anesthesia.\n4.  Seizures\nClonazepam is occasionally used as an adjunctive therapy for certain types of seizures, whereas lorazepam and\ndiazepam are the drugs of choice in terminating status epilepticus (see",

Pharmacokinetics\n1.  Absorption and distribution\nThe benzodiazepines are lipophilic. They are rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration, distribute\nthroughout the body, and penetrate into the CNS.\n2.  Duration of action\nThe half-lives of the benzodiazepines are important clinically, because the duration of action may determine the\ntherapeutic usefulness. The benzodiazepines can be roughly divided into short-, intermediate-, and long-acting\ngroups (Figure 9.4). The longer-acting agents form active metabolites with long half-lives. However, with some\nbenzodiazepines, the clinical duration of action does not correlate with the actual half-life (otherwise, a dose of\ndiazepam could conceivably be given only every other day, given its long half-life and active metabolites). This may\nbe due to receptor dissociation rates in the CNS and subsequent redistribution to fatty tissues and other areas.\n344\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 345 ---\n\n345\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 346 ---\n\nFigure 9.4 Comparison of the durations of action of the benzodiazepines.\n3.  Fate\nMost benzodiazepines, including chlordiazepoxide and diazepam, are metabolized by the hepatic microsomal\nsystem to compounds that are also active. For these benzodiazepines, the apparent half-life of the drug represents the\ncombined actions of the parent drug and its metabolites. The benzodiazepines are excreted in the urine as\nglucuronides or oxidized metabolites. All benzodiazepines cross the placenta and may depress the CNS of the\nnewborn if given before birth. The benzodiazepines are not recommended for use during pregnancy. Nursing infants\nmay also be exposed to the drugs in breast milk.\n346\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 347 ---\n\nE.  Dependence\nPsychological and physical dependence can develop if high doses of benzodiazepines are given for a prolonged\nperiod. All benzodiazepines are controlled substances. Abrupt discontinuation of these agents results in withdrawal\nsymptoms, including confusion, anxiety, agitation, restlessness, insomnia, tension, and (rarely) seizures.\nBenzodiazepines with a short elimination half-life, such as triazolam, induce more abrupt and severe withdrawal\nreactions than those seen with drugs that are slowly eliminated such as flurazepam (Figure 9.5).\nFigure 9.5 Frequency of rebound insomnia resulting from discontinuation of\nbenzodiazepine therapy.\n347\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 348 ---\n\nF.  Adverse effects\nDrowsiness and confusion are the most common adverse effects of the benzodiazepines. Ataxia occurs at high doses\nand precludes activities that require fine motor coordination, such as driving an automobile. Cognitive impairment\n(decreased recall and retention of new knowledge) can occur with use of benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines should\nbe used cautiously in patients with liver disease. Alcohol and other CNS depressants enhance the sedative–hypnotic\neffects of the benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines are, however, considerably less dangerous than the older anxiolytic\nand hypnotic drugs. As a result, a drug overdose is seldom lethal unless other central depressants, such as alcohol or\nopioids, are taken concurrently.\n348\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 349 ---\n\nIII.  Benzodiazepine Antagonist\nFlumazenil  [floo-MAZ-eh-nill] is a GABA receptor antagonist that rapidly reverses the effects of benzodiazepines.\nThe drug is available for intravenous (IV) administration only. Onset is rapid, but the duration is short, with a half-\nlife of about 1 hour. Frequent administration may be necessary to maintain reversal of a long-acting benzodiazepine.\nAdministration of flumazenil  may precipitate withdrawal in dependent patients or cause seizures if a benzodiazepine\nis used to control seizure activity. Seizures may also result if the patient has a mixed ingestion with tricyclic\nantidepressants or antipsychotics. Dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and agitation are the most common adverse effects.\n349\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 350 ---\n\nIV.  Other Anxiolytic Agents\n350\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 351 ---\n\nA.  Antidepressants\nMany antidepressants are effective in the treatment of chronic anxiety disorders and should be considered as first-\nline agents, especially in patients with concerns for addiction or dependence. SSRIs (such as escitalopram or\nparoxetine) or serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs, such as venlafaxine or duloxetine) may be used\nalone or prescribed in combination with a benzodiazepine during the first week of treatment (Figure 9.6). After 4 to\n6 weeks, when the antidepressant begins to produce an anxiolytic effect, the benzodiazepine dose can be tapered.\nWhile only certain SSRIs or SNRIs have been approved for the treatment of anxiety disorders such as GAD, the\nefficacy of these drugs is most likely a class effect. Long-term use of antidepressants and benzodiazepines for\nanxiety disorders is often required to maintain ongoing benefit and prevent relapse.\nFigure 9.6 Treatment guideline for persistent anxiety.\n351\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 352 ---\n\nB.  Buspirone\nBuspirone [byoo-SPYE-rone] is useful for the chronic treatment of GAD and has an efficacy comparable to that of\nbenzodiazepines. It has a slow onset of action and is not effective for short-term or “as-needed” treatment of acute\nanxiety. The actions of buspirone appear to be mediated by serotonin (5-HT1A) receptors, although it also displays\nsome affinity for D2 dopamine receptors and 5-HT2A serotonin receptors. Thus, its mode of action differs from that\nof the benzodiazepines. In addition, buspirone lacks the anticonvulsant and muscle-relaxant properties of the\nbenzodiazepines. The frequency of adverse effects is low, with the most common effects being headache, dizziness,\nnervousness, nausea, and light-headedness. Sedation and psychomotor and cognitive dysfunction are minimal, and\ndependence is unlikely. Buspirone does not potentiate the CNS depression of alcohol. Figure 9.7 compares common\nadverse effects of buspirone and the benzodiazepine alprazolam.\n352\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 353 ---\n\nFigure 9.7 Comparison of common adverse effects of buspirone and alprazolam. Results\nare expressed as the percentage of patients showing each symptom.\n353\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 354 ---\n\n354\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 355 ---\n\nV.  Barbiturates\nThe barbiturates were formerly the mainstay of treatment to sedate patients or to induce and maintain sleep. They\nhave been largely replaced by the benzodiazepines, primarily because barbiturates induce tolerance and physical\ndependence, are lethal in overdose, and are associated with severe withdrawal symptoms. All barbiturates are\ncontrolled substances.\n355\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 356 ---\n\nA.  Mechanism of action\nThe sedative–hypnotic action of the barbiturates is due to their interaction with GABAA receptors, which enhances\nGABAergic transmission. The binding site of barbiturates on the GABA receptor is distinct from that of the\nbenzodiazepines. Barbiturates potentiate GABA action on chloride entry into the neuron by prolonging the duration\nof the chloride channel openings. In addition, barbiturates can block excitatory glutamate receptors. These molecular\nactions lead to decreased neuronal activity.\n356\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 357 ---\n\nB.  Actions\nBarbiturates are classified according to their duration of action (Figure 9.8). Long-acting phenobarbital  [fee-noe-\nBAR-bi-tal] has a duration of action greater than a day. Pentobarbital  [pen-toe-BAR-bi-tal], secobarbital  [see-koe-\nBAR-bi-tal], amobarbital  [am-oh-BAR-bi-tal], and butalbital  [bu-TAL-bi-tal] are short-acting barbiturates.\nFigure 9.8 Barbiturates classified according to their durations of action.\n357\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 358 ---\n\n1.  Depression of CNS\nAt low doses, the barbiturates produce sedation (have a calming effect and reduce excitement). At higher doses, the\ndrugs cause hypnosis, followed by anesthesia (loss of feeling or sensation), and, finally, coma and death. Thus, any\ndegree of depression of the CNS is possible, depending on the dose. Barbiturates do not raise the pain threshold and\nhave no analgesic properties. They may even exacerbate pain. Chronic use leads to tolerance.\n2.  Respiratory depression\nBarbiturates suppress the hypoxic and chemoreceptor response to CO2, and overdose is followed by respiratory\ndepression and death.\n358\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 359 ---\n\nC.  Therapeutic uses\n1.  Anesthesia\nThe ultra–short-acting barbiturates have been historically used intravenously to induce anesthesia but have been\nreplaced by other agents.\n2.  Anticonvulsant\nPhenobarbital  has specific anticonvulsant activity that is distinguished from the nonspecific CNS depression.\nHowever, phenobarbital  can depress cognitive development in children and decrease cognitive performance in\nadults, and it should be used for seizures only if other therapies have failed. Similarly, phenobarbital  may be used\nfor the treatment of refractory status epilepticus.\n3.  Sedative/hypnotic\nBarbiturates have been used as mild sedatives to relieve anxiety, nervous tension, and insomnia. When used as\nhypnotics, they suppress REM sleep more than other stages. However, the use of barbiturates for insomnia is no\nlonger generally accepted, given their adverse effects and potential for tolerance. Butalbital  is commonly used in\ncombination products (with acetaminophen and caffeine or aspirin and caffeine) as a sedative to assist in the\nmanagement of tension or migraine headaches.\n359\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 360 ---\n\nD.  Pharmacokinetics\nBarbiturates are well absorbed after oral administration and distribute throughout the body. All barbiturates\nredistribute from the brain to the splanchnic areas, to skeletal muscle, and, finally, to adipose tissue. Barbiturates\nreadily cross the placenta and can depress the fetus. These agents are metabolized in the liver, and inactive\nmetabolites are excreted in urine.\n360\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 361 ---\n\nE.  Adverse effects\nBarbiturates cause drowsiness, impaired concentration, and mental and psychomotor impairment ( Figure 9.9). The\nCNS depressant effects of barbiturates synergize with those of ethanol .\n361\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 362 ---\n\n362\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 363 ---\n\nFigure 9.9 Adverse effects of barbiturates.\nHypnotic doses of barbiturates produce a drug “hangover” that may lead to impaired ability to function normally for\nmany hours after waking. Occasionally, nausea and dizziness occur. Barbiturates induce cytochrome P450\n(CYP450) microsomal enzymes in the liver. Therefore, chronic barbiturate administration diminishes the action of\nmany drugs that are metabolized by the CYP450 system. Barbiturates are contraindicated in patients with acute\nintermittent porphyria. Abrupt withdrawal from barbiturates may cause tremors, anxiety, weakness, restlessness,\nnausea and vomiting, seizures, delirium, and cardiac arrest. Withdrawal is much more severe than that associated\nwith opioids and can result in death. Death may also result from overdose. Severe depression of respiration and\ncentral cardiovascular depression results in a shock-like condition with shallow, infrequent breathing. Treatment\nincludes supportive care and gastric decontamination for recent ingestions.\n363\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 364 ---\n\nVI.  Other Hypnotic Agents\n364\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 365 ---\n\nA.  Zolpidem\nThe hypnotic zolpidem [ZOL-pi-dem] is not structurally related to benzodiazepines, but it binds to GABAA\nreceptors with relative selectivity for those with the α1 subunit. Zolpidem has no anticonvulsant or muscle-relaxing\nproperties at hypnotic doses. It shows few withdrawal effects, exhibits minimal rebound insomnia, and little\ntolerance occurs with prolonged use. Zolpidem is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. It has a rapid onset of\naction and short elimination half-life (about 2 to 3 hours). The drug provides a hypnotic effect for approximately 5\nhours (Figure 9.10). [Note: A lingual spray and an extended-release formulation are also available. A sublingual\ntablet formulation may be used for middle-of-the-night awakening.] Zolpidem undergoes hepatic oxidation by the\nCYP450 system to inactive products. Thus, drugs such as rifampin, which induce this enzyme system, shorten the\nhalf-life of zolpidem, and drugs that inhibit the CYP3A4 isoenzyme may increase the half-life. Adverse effects of\nzolpidem include headache, dizziness, anterograde amnesia, and next-morning impairment (especially with\nextended-release formulations). Sleep-walking, sleep-driving, and performing other activities while not fully awake\nhave been reported. Unlike the benzodiazepines, at usual hypnotic doses, the nonbenzodiazepine drugs, zolpidem,\nzaleplon, and eszopiclone, do not significantly alter the various sleep stages and, hence, are often the preferred\nhypnotics. All three agents are controlled substances.\nFigure 9.10 Onset and duration of action of the commonly used nonbenzodiazepine\nhypnotic agents.\n365\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 366 ---\n\nB.  Zaleplon\nZaleplon [ZAL-e-plon] is an oral nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic similar to zolpidem; however, zaleplon causes fewer\nresidual effects on psychomotor and cognitive function compared to zolpidem or the benzodiazepines. This may be\ndue to its rapid elimination, with a half-life of approximately 1 hour. The drug is metabolized by CYP3A4.\n366\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 367 ---\n\nC.  Eszopiclone\nEszopiclone [es-ZOE-pi-clone] is an oral nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic that has been shown to be effective for\ninsomnia for up to 6 months. Eszopiclone is rapidly absorbed (time to peak, 1 hour), extensively metabolized by\noxidation and demethylation via the CYP450 system, and mainly excreted in urine. Elimination half-life is\napproximately 6 hours. Adverse events with eszopiclone include anxiety, dry mouth, headache, peripheral edema,\nsomnolence, and unpleasant taste.\n367\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 368 ---\n\nD.  Melatonin receptor agonists\nRamelteon [ram-EL-tee-on] and tasimelteon [tas-i-MEL-tee-on] are selective agonists at the MT1 and MT2 subtypes\nof melatonin receptors. Melatonin is a hormone secreted by the pineal gland that helps to maintain the circadian\nrhythm underlying the normal sleep–wake cycle. Stimulation of MT1 and MT2 receptors by ramelteon and\ntasimelteon is thought to induce and promote sleep. They have minimal potential for abuse, and no evidence of\ndependence or withdrawal has been observed. Therefore, ramelteon and tasimelteon can be administered long-term.\nRamelteon is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulty falling asleep (increased sleep\nlatency). Common adverse effects of ramelteon include dizziness, fatigue, and somnolence. Ramelteon may also\nincrease prolactin levels. Tasimelteon is indicated for non–24-hour sleep–wake disorder, often experienced by\npatients who are blind. The most common adverse effects of tasimelteon are headache, abnormal dreams, increase in\nliver function tests, and possible upper respiratory tract infections. CYP450 1A2 and 3A4 are the principle\nisoenzymes required for metabolism of ramelteon and tasimelteon, and, thus, drug–drug interactions are possible\nwith inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes.\n368\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 369 ---\n\nE.

Orexin is a neuropeptide that promotes\nwakefulness. Antagonism of the effects of orexin suppresses the wake drive from this neuropeptide. This\nantagonism may also explain the adverse events that are similar to signs of narcolepsy and cataplexy. The loss of\norexin-producing neurons is believed to be an underlying pathology for narcolepsy. Daytime somnolence and\nincreased suicidal ideation are other reported adverse effects. Suvorexant  is mainly metabolized by CYP450 3A4,\nand, thus, it may have drug interactions with CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors.\nFigure 9.11 summarizes the therapeutic disadvantages and advantages of some of the anxiolytic and hypnotic\ndrugs.\nFigure 9.11 Therapeutic disadvantages and advantages of some anxiolytic and hypnotic\nagents. CNS = central nervous system.\n371\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 372 ---\n\n9.1\n9.2\n9.3\n9.4\n9.5\n9.6Study Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nWhich one of the following statements is correct regarding benzodiazepines?\nA.  Benzodiazepines directly open chloride channels.\nB.  Benzodiazepines show analgesic actions.\nC.  Clinical improvement of anxiety requires 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with benzodiazepines.\nD.  All benzodiazepines have some sedative effects.\nCorrect answer = D. Although all benzodiazepines can cause sedation, the drugs labeled “benzodiazepines” in\nFigure 9.1 are promoted for the treatment of sleep disorder. Benzodiazepines enhance the binding of GABAA to\nits receptor, which increases the permeability of chloride. The benzodiazepines do not relieve pain but may reduce\nthe anxiety associated with pain. Unlike the tricyclic antidepressants and the monoamine oxidase inhibitors, the\nbenzodiazepines are effective within hours of administration. Benzodiazepines do not produce general anesthesia\nand therefore are relatively safe drugs with a high therapeutic index.\nWhich one of the following is a short-acting hypnotic?\nA.  Phenobarbital\nB.  Diazepam\nC.  Chlordiazepoxide\nD.  Triazolam\nCorrect answer = D. Triazolam is a short-acting hypnotic agent. It causes little daytime sedation. The other\nmedications listed are longer acting with longer half-lives.\nWhich one of the following statements is correct regarding the anxiolytic and hypnotic agents?\nA.  Diazepam and phenobarbital induce the cytochrome P450 enzyme system.\nB.  Phenobarbital is useful in the treatment of acute intermittent porphyria.\nC.  Phenobarbital induces respiratory depression, which is enhanced by the consumption of ethanol.\nD.  Buspirone has actions similar to those of benzodiazepines.\nCorrect answer = C. Barbiturates and ethanol are a potentially lethal combination because of a high risk for\nrespiratory depression. Only phenobarbital strongly induces the synthesis of the hepatic cytochrome P450 drug-\nmetabolizing system. Phenobarbital is contraindicated in the treatment of acute intermittent porphyria. Buspirone\nlacks the anticonvulsant and muscle-relaxant properties of the benzodiazepines and causes only minimal sedation.\nA 45-year-old man who has been injured in a car accident is brought into the emergency department. His\nblood alcohol level at admission is 275 mg/dL. Hospital records show a prior hospitalization for alcohol-\nrelated seizures. His wife confirms that he has been drinking heavily for 3 weeks. What treatment should be\nprovided to the patient if he goes into withdrawal?\nA.  No pharmacological treatment is necessary.\nB.  Lorazepam.\nC.  Phenytoin.\nD.  Buspirone.\nCorrect answer = B. It is important to treat the seizures associated with alcohol withdrawal. Benzodiazepines such\nas chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, or the shorter-acting lorazepam are effective in controlling this problem. They are\nless sedating than phenytoin, have fewer adverse effects, and are cross-tolerant with alcohol. Buspirone will not\nprevent the seizures associated with alcohol withdrawal.\nA 36-year-old male patient reports difficulty falling asleep for the past 2 weeks but needs to be able to wake\nup at 6 AM for work and doesn’t want any daytime sedation. Which medication is best to recommend for the\ntreatment of his insomnia?\nA.  Temazepam\nB.  Flurazepam\nC.  Zaleplon\nD.  Buspirone\nCorrect answer = C. Zaleplon has the shortest half-life and duration of action. Buspirone is not effective as a\nhypnotic agent. Temazepam and flurazepam have a longer duration of action and reduce nighttime awakenings\nbut have a greater risk of daytime sedation or hangover effect compared with zaleplon.\nA 45-year-old woman reports constant daytime anxiety about work and family problems. This is causing\ndifficulties functioning and participating in necessary daily activities. Which of the following agents has a\nrapid anxiolytic effect and is best for the acute management of her anxiety?\nA.  Buspirone372\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 373 ---\n\n9.7\n9.8\n9.9\n9.10B.  Venlafaxine\nC.  Lorazepam\nD.  Escitalopram\nCorrect answer = C. The benzodiazepines have same-day, first-dose efficacy for anxiety, whereas the other agents\nrequire 2 to 8 weeks for clinically significant improvement in anxiety to occur.\nWhich of the following sedative–hypnotic agents utilizes melatonin receptor agonist as the mechanism of\naction to induce sleep?\nA.  Zolpidem\nB.  Eszopiclone\nC.  Estazolam\nD.  Tasimelteon\nCorrect answer = D. Tasimelteon is a melatonin receptor agonist to promote sleep, especially in those individuals\nwith non–24-hour sleep–wake disorder. Zolpidem, eszopiclone, and estazolam all utilize the benzodiazepine\nreceptor.\nA 50-year-old man presents with insomnia not responsive to sleep hygiene interventions. He has a long\nhistory of alcohol and opioid abuse. He has been successfully sober for 10 years but is very concerned about\nfuture addiction and dependence. Which is most appropriate to address insomnia and minimize the risk for\ndependence in this patient?\nA.  Zaleplon\nB.  Flurazepam\nC.  Doxepin\nD.  Zolpidem\nCorrect answer = C. Only doxepin, a tricyclic agent with significant antihistaminergic properties, is considered to\nhave no risk of addiction or dependence. The other agents are all controlled substances with some risk for\naddiction or dependence, especially when used for extended periods.\nA 68-year-old female patient is demonstrating signs and symptoms of insomnia, especially difficulty falling\nasleep. She is afraid of taking a medication that can negatively affect her memory and concentration, as she\nis still working as a bookkeeper. She has been taking temazepam for the past 4 days and has noticed a\nmemory problem and would like to discontinue this medication. Which medication is most appropriate to\ntreat the insomnia and minimize the risk for cognitive impairment?\nA.  Diphenhydramine\nB.  Zolpidem\nC.  Alprazolam\nD.  Ramelteon\nCorrect answer = D. All of these agents, except ramelteon, have been associated with cognitive impairments,\nincluding memory impairment. Diphenhydramine likely causes its cognitive problems from its anticholinergic\nand antihistaminergic effects. Zolpidem and alprazolam are well-known causes of cognitive impairment,\nincluding anterograde amnesia. Ramelteon is a noncontrolled hypnotic agent acting as a melatonin receptor\nagonist. It is not considered to have a risk for cognitive impairment compared with the other agents listed.\nAn 18-year-old woman is admitted to the emergency room after an accidental overdose of alprazolam. She is\nunconscious and not considered a regular user of any medications or illicit drugs. Which treatment could be\nused to reverse the effect of the alprazolam overdose?\nA.  Diazepam\nB.  Ramelteon\nC.  Flumazenil\nD.  Naloxone\nCorrect answer = C. Flumazenil is only indicated to reverse the effects of benzodiazepines via antagonism of the\nbenzodiazepine receptor. It should be used with caution because of a risk of seizures if the patient has been a\nlong-time recipient of benzodiazepines or if the overdose attempt was with mixed drugs. Naloxone is an opioid\nreceptor antagonist. The other agents are not efficacious in reversing effects of benzodiazepines.373\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 374 ---\n\n10\nAntidepressants\nJose A. Rey\n374\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 375 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nThe symptoms of depression are feelings of sadness and hopelessness, as well as the inability to experience pleasure\nin usual activities, changes in sleep patterns and appetite, loss of energy, and suicidal thoughts. Mania is\ncharacterized by the opposite behavior: enthusiasm, anger, rapid thought and speech patterns, extreme self-\nconfidence, and impaired judgment. This chapter provides an overview of drugs used for the treatment of depression\nand mania.\n375\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 376 ---\n\nII.  Mechanism of Antidepressant Drugs\nMost antidepressant drugs ( Figure 10.1) potentiate, either directly or indirectly, the actions of norepinephrine and/or\nserotonin (5-HT) in the brain. This, along with other evidence, led to the biogenic amine theory, which proposes that\ndepression is due to a deficiency of monoamines, such as norepinephrine and serotonin, at certain key sites in the\nbrain. Conversely, the theory proposes that mania is caused by an overproduction of these neurotransmitters.\nHowever, the biogenic amine theory of depression and mania is overly simplistic. It fails to explain the time course\nfor a therapeutic response, which usually occurs over several weeks compared to the immediate pharmacodynamic\neffects of the agents, which are usually immediate. This suggests that decreased reuptake of neurotransmitters is\nonly an initial effect of the drugs, which may not be directly responsible for the antidepressant effects.\n376\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 377 ---\n\n377\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 378 ---\n\nFigure 10.1 Summary of antidepressants. (Figure continues on next page)\n378\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 379 ---\n\nIII.  Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors\nThe selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a group of antidepressant drugs that specifically inhibit\nserotonin reuptake, having 300- to 3000-fold greater selectivity for the serotonin transporter, as compared to the\nnorepinephrine transporter. This contrasts with the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and serotonin-norepinephrine\nreuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) that nonselectively inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin ( Figure 10.2).\nMoreover, the SSRIs have little blocking activity at muscarinic, α-adrenergic, and histaminic H1 receptors. Because\nthey have different adverse effects and are relatively safe in overdose, the SSRIs have largely replaced TCAs and\nmonoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) as the drugs of choice in treating depression. The SSRIs include fluoxetine\n[floo-OX-e-teen] (the prototypic drug), citalopram [sye-TAL-oh-pram], escitalopram [es-sye-TAL-oh-pram],\nfluvoxamine [floo-VOX-e-meen], paroxetine [pa-ROX-e-teen], and sertraline [SER-tra-leen]. Escitalopram is the\npure S-enantiomer of citalopram.\nFigure 10.2 Relative receptor specificity of some antidepressant drugs. *Venlafaxine\ninhibits norepinephrine reuptake only at high doses. ++++ = very strong affinity; +++ =\nstrong affinity; ++ = moderate affinity; + = weak affinity; 0 = little or no affinity.\n379\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 380 ---\n\nA.  Actions\nThe SSRIs block the reuptake of serotonin, leading to increased concentrations of the neurotransmitter in the\nsynaptic cleft. Antidepressants, including SSRIs, typically take at least 2 weeks to produce significant improvement\nin mood, and maximum benefit may require up to 12 weeks or more (Figure 10.3).\nFigure 10.3 Onset of therapeutic effects of the major antidepressant drugs requires\nseveral weeks.\n380\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 381 ---\n\nB.  Therapeutic uses\nThe primary indication for SSRIs is depression. A number of other psychiatric disorders also respond favorably to\nSSRIs, including obsessive–compulsive disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress\ndisorder, social anxiety disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and bulimia nervosa (only fluoxetine is approved\nfor bulimia).\n381\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 382 ---\n\nC.  Pharmacokinetics\nAll of the SSRIs are well absorbed after oral administration. Peak levels are seen in approximately 2 to 8 hours on\naverage. Food has little effect on absorption (except with sertraline, for which food increases its absorption). The\nmajority of SSRIs have plasma half-lives that range between 16 and 36 hours. Metabolism by cytochrome P450\n(CYP450)–dependent enzymes and glucuronide or sulfate conjugation occur extensively. Fluoxetine differs from the\nother members of the class by having a much longer half-life (50 hours), and the half-life of its active metabolite S-\nnorfluoxetine is quite long, averaging 10 days. Fluoxetine and paroxetine are potent inhibitors of a CYP450\nisoenzyme (CYP2D6). Other CYP450 isoenzymes (CYP2C9/19, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2) are involved with SSRI\nmetabolism and may also be inhibited to various degrees by the SSRIs.\n382\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 383 ---\n\nD.  Adverse effects\nAlthough the SSRIs are considered to have fewer and less severe adverse effects than the TCAs and MAOIs, the\nSSRIs are not without adverse effects, such as headache, sweating, anxiety and agitation, hyponatremia,\ngastrointestinal (GI) effects (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), weakness and fatigue, sexual dysfunction, changes in\nweight, sleep disturbances (insomnia and somnolence), and the above-mentioned potential for drug–drug\ninteractions (Figure 10.4).\n383\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 384 ---\n\n384\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 385 ---\n\nFigure 10.4 Some commonly observed adverse effects of selective serotonin reuptake\ninhibitors.\n1.  Sleep disturbances\nParoxetine and fluvoxamine are generally more sedating than activating, and they may be useful in patients who\nhave difficulty sleeping. Conversely, patients who are fatigued or complaining of excessive somnolence may benefit\nfrom one of the more activating SSRIs, such as fluoxetine or sertraline.\n2.  Sexual dysfunction\nSexual dysfunction, which may include loss of libido, delayed ejaculation, and anorgasmia, is common with the\nSSRIs.\n3.  Use in children and teenagers\nAntidepressants should be used cautiously in children and teenagers, because of reports of suicidal ideation as a\nresult of SSRI treatment. Pediatric patients should be observed for worsening depression and suicidal thinking with\ninitiation or dosage change of any antidepressant. Fluoxetine, sertraline, and fluvoxamine are approved for use in\nchildren to treat obsessive–compulsive disorder, and fluoxetine and escitalopram are approved to treat childhood\ndepression.\n4.  Overdose\nOverdose with SSRIs does not usually cause cardiac arrhythmias, with the exception of citalopram, which may\ncause QT prolongation. Seizures are a possibility because all antidepressants may lower the seizure threshold. SSRIs\nhave the potential to cause serotonin syndrome, especially when used in the presence of an MAOI or other highly\nserotonergic drug. Serotonin syndrome may include the symptoms of hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, sweating,\nmyoclonus (clonic muscle twitching), and changes in mental status and vital signs.\n5.  Discontinuation syndrome\nSSRIs have the potential to cause a discontinuation syndrome after their abrupt withdrawal, particularly the agents\nwith shorter half-lives and inactive metabolites. Fluoxetine has the lowest risk of causing an SSRI discontinuation\nsyndrome due to its longer half-life and active metabolite. Possible signs and symptoms of SSRI discontinuation\nsyndrome include headache, malaise and flu-like symptoms, agitation and irritability, nervousness, and changes in\nsleep pattern.\n385\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 386 ---\n\nIV.  Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors\nVenlafaxine [VEN-la-fax-een], desvenlafaxine [dez-VEN-la-fax-een], levomilnacipran [lee-voe-mil-NA-si-pran],\nand duloxetine [doo-LOX-e-teen] inhibit the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine (Figure 10.5) and, thus,\nare termed SNRIs. Depression is often accompanied by chronic pain, such as backache and muscle aches, for which\nSSRIs are relatively ineffective. This pain is, in part, modulated by serotonin and norepinephrine pathways in the\ncentral nervous system. With dual inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, both the SNRIs and the\nTCAs may be effective in relieving pain. These agents are also used in the treatment of pain syndromes, such as\ndiabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, fibromyalgia, and low back pain. The SNRIs, unlike the\nTCAs, have little activity at α-adrenergic, muscarinic, or histamine receptors and, thus, have fewer receptor-\nmediated adverse effects than the TCAs. The SNRIs may precipitate a discontinuation syndrome if treatment is\nabruptly stopped.\nFigure 10.5 Proposed mechanism of action of selective serotonin-norepinephrine\nreuptake inhibitor antidepressant drugs.\n386\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 387 ---\n\nA.  Venlafaxine and desvenlafaxine\nVenlafaxine is an inhibitor of serotonin reuptake and, at medium to higher doses, is an inhibitor of norepinephrine\nreuptake. Venlafaxine has minimal inhibition of the CYP450 isoenzymes and is a substrate of the CYP2D6\nisoenzyme. Desvenlafaxine is the active, demethylated metabolite of venlafaxine. The most common side effects of\nvenlafaxine are nausea, headache, sexual dysfunction, dizziness, insomnia, sedation, and constipation. At high doses,\nthere may be an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. The clinical activity and adverse effect profile of\ndesvenlafaxine are similar to that of venlafaxine.\n387\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 388 ---\n\nB.  Duloxetine\nDuloxetine inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake at all doses. It is extensively metabolized in the liver to\ninactive metabolites and should be avoided in patients with liver dysfunction. GI side effects are common with\nduloxetine, including nausea, dry mouth, and constipation. Insomnia, dizziness, somnolence, sweating, and sexual\ndysfunction are also seen. Duloxetine may increase blood pressure or heart rate. Duloxetine is a moderate inhibitor\nof CYP2D6 isoenzymes and may increase concentrations of drugs metabolized by this pathway, such as\nantipsychotics.\n388\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 389 ---\n\nC.  Levomilnacipran\nLevomilnacipran is an enantiomer of milnacipran (an older SNRI used for the treatment of depression in Europe and\nfibromyalgia in the United States). The adverse effect profile of levomilnacipran is similar to other SNRIs. It is\nprimarily metabolized by CYP3A4, and, thus, activity may be altered by inducers or inhibitors of this enzyme\nsystem.\n389\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 390 ---\n\nV.  Atypical Antidepressants\nThe atypical antidepressants are a mixed group of agents that have actions at several different sites. This group\nincludes bupropion [byoo-PROE-pee-on], mirtazapine [mir-TAZ-a-peen], nefazodone [ne-FAZ-oh-done], trazodone\n[TRAZ-oh-done], vilazodone [vil-AZ-oh-done], and vortioxetine [vor-TEE-ox-e-teen].\n390\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 391 ---\n\nA.  Bupropion\nBupropion is a weak dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that is used to alleviate the symptoms of\ndepression. Bupropion is also useful for decreasing cravings and attenuating withdrawal symptoms of nicotine in\npatients trying to quit smoking. Side effects may include dry mouth, sweating, nervousness, tremor, and a dose-\ndependent increased risk for seizures. It has a very low incidence of sexual dysfunction. Bupropion is metabolized\nby the CYP2B6 pathway and has a relatively low risk for drug–drug interactions, given the few agents that\ninhibit/induce this enzyme. Use of bupropion should be avoided in patients at risk for seizures or those who have\neating disorders such as bulimia.\n391\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 392 ---\n\nB.  Mirtazapine\nMirtazapine enhances serotonin and norepinephrine neurotransmission by serving as an antagonist at central\npresynaptic α2 receptors. Additionally, some of the antidepressant activity may be related to antagonism at 5-HT2\nreceptors. It is sedating because of its potent antihistaminic activity, but it does not cause the antimuscarinic side\neffects of the TCAs or interfere with sexual function like the SSRIs. Sedation, increased appetite, and weight gain\nfrequently occur (Figure 10.6).\nFigure 10.6 Some commonly observed adverse effects of mirtazapine.\n392\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 393 ---\n\nC.  Nefazodone and trazodone\nThese drugs are weak inhibitors of serotonin reuptake and are also antagonists at the postsynaptic 5-HT2a receptor.\nBoth agents are sedating, probably because of their potent histamine H1-blocking activity. Trazodone is commonly\nused off-label for the management of insomnia. Trazodone has been associated with priapism, and nefazodone has\nbeen associated with a risk for hepatotoxicity. Both agents also have mild-to-moderate α1 receptor antagonism,\ncontributing to orthostasis and dizziness.\n393\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 394 ---\n\nD.  Vilazodone\nVilazodone is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a 5-HT1a receptor partial agonist. Although the extent to which the\n5-HT1a receptor activity contributes to its therapeutic effects is unknown, this possible mechanism of action renders\nit unique from that of the SSRIs. The adverse effect profile of vilazodone is similar to the SSRIs, including a risk for\ndiscontinuation syndrome if abruptly stopped.\n394\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 395 ---\n\nE.  Vortioxetine\nVortioxetine utilizes a combination of serotonin reuptake inhibition, 5-HT1a agonism, and 5-HT3 and 5-HT7\nantagonism as its suggested mechanisms of action to treat depression. It is unclear to what extent the activities other\nthan inhibition of serotonin reuptake influence the overall effects of vortioxetine. The common adverse effects\ninclude nausea, constipation, and sexual dysfunction, which may be expected due to its serotonergic mechanisms.\n395\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 396 ---\n\nVI.  Tricyclic Antidepressants\nThe TCAs inhibit norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake into the presynaptic neuron and, thus, if discovered today,\nmight have been referred to as SNRIs, except for their differences in adverse effects relative to this newer class of\nantidepressants. The TCAs include the tertiary amines imipramine [ee-MIP-ra-meen] (the prototype drug),\namitriptyline [a-mee-TRIP-ti-leen], clomipramine [kloe-MIP-ra-meen], doxepin [DOX-e-pin], and trimipramine\n[trye-MIP-ra-meen], and the secondary amines desipramine [dess-IP-ra-meen] and nortriptyline [nor-TRIP-ti-leen]\n(the N-demethylated metabolites of imipramine and amitriptyline, respectively) and protriptyline [proe-TRIP-ti-\nleen]. Maprotiline [ma-PROE-ti-leen] and amoxapine [a-MOX-a-peen] are related “tetracyclic” antidepressant\nagents and are commonly included in the general class of TCAs.\n396\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 397 ---\n\nA.  Mechanism of action\n1.  Inhibition of neurotransmitter reuptake\nTCAs and amoxapine are potent inhibitors of the neuronal reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin into presynaptic\nnerve terminals. Maprotiline and desipramine are relatively selective inhibitors of norepinephrine reuptake.\n2.  Blocking of receptors\nTCAs also block serotonergic, α-adrenergic, histaminic, and muscarinic receptors. It is not known if any of these\nactions produce the therapeutic benefit of the TCAs. However, actions at these receptors are likely responsible for\nmany of their adverse effects. Amoxapine also blocks 5-HT2 and dopamine D2 receptors.\n397\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 398 ---\n\nB.  Actions\nThe TCAs improve mood, in 50% to 70% of individuals with major depression. The onset of the mood elevation is\nslow, requiring 2 weeks or longer ( Figure 10.3). Patient response can be used to adjust dosage. Tapering of these\nagents is recommended to minimize discontinuation syndromes and cholinergic rebound effects.\n398\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 399 ---\n\nC.  Therapeutic uses\nThe TCAs are effective in treating moderate to severe depression. Some patients with panic disorder also respond to\nTCAs. Imipramine is used as an alternative to desmopressin or nonpharmacologic therapies (enuresis alarms) in the\ntreatment of bed-wetting in children. The TCAs, particularly amitriptyline, have been used to help prevent migraine\nheadache and treat chronic pain syndromes (for example, neuropathic pain) in a number of conditions for which the\ncause of pain is unclear. Low doses of TCAs, especially doxepin, can be used to treat insomnia.\n399\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 400 ---\n\nD.  Pharmacokinetics\nTCAs are well absorbed upon oral administration. As a result of their variable first-pass metabolism in the liver,\nTCAs have low and inconsistent bioavailability. These drugs are metabolized by the hepatic microsomal system\n(and, thus, may be sensitive to agents that induce or inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes) and conjugated with\nglucuronic acid. Ultimately, the TCAs are excreted as inactive metabolites via the kidney.\n400\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 401 ---\n\nE.  Adverse effects\nBlockade of muscarinic receptors leads to blurred vision, xerostomia, urinary retention, sinus tachycardia,\nconstipation, and aggravation of angle-closure glaucoma ( Figure 10.7). These agents affect cardiac conduction\nsimilar to quinidine and may precipitate life-threatening arrhythmias in an overdose situation. The TCAs also block\nα-adrenergic receptors, causing orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and reflex tachycardia. Sedation is related to the\nability of these drugs to block histamine H1 receptors. Weight gain is a common adverse effect of the TCAs. Sexual\ndysfunction occurs in a minority of patients, and the incidence is lower than that associated with the SSRIs.\n401\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 402 ---\n\n402\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 403 ---\n\nFigure 10.7 Some commonly observed adverse effects of tricyclic antidepressants.\nAll antidepressants, including TCAs, should be used with caution in patients with bipolar disorder, even during their\ndepressed state, because antidepressants may cause a switch to manic behavior. The TCAs have a narrow therapeutic\nindex (for example, five- to six-fold the maximal daily dose of imipramine can be lethal). Depressed patients who\nare suicidal should be given only limited quantities of these drugs and be monitored closely. Drug interactions with\nthe TCAs are shown in Figure 10.8. The TCAs may exacerbate certain medical conditions, such as benign prostatic\nhyperplasia, epilepsy, and preexisting arrhythmias.\n403\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 404 ---\n\nFigure 10.8 Drugs interacting with tricyclic antidepressants. CNS = central nervous\nsystem; MAO = monoamine oxidase.\n404\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 405 ---\n\nVII.  Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors\nMonoamine oxidase (MAO) is a mitochondrial enzyme found in nerve and other tissues, such as the gut and liver. In\nthe neuron, MAO functions as a “safety valve” to oxidatively deaminate and inactivate any excess neurotransmitters\n(for example, norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin) that may leak out of synaptic vesicles when the neuron is at\nrest. The MAOIs may irreversibly or reversibly inactivate the enzyme, permitting neurotransmitters to escape\ndegradation and, therefore, to accumulate within the presynaptic neuron and leak into the synaptic space. The four\nMAOIs currently available for the treatment of depression include phenelzine [FEN-el-zeen], tranylcypromine [tran-\nil-SIP-roe-meen], isocarboxazid [eye-soe-car-BOX-ih-zid], and selegiline [seh-LEDGE-ah-leen]. [Note: Selegiline\nis also used for the treatment of Parkinson disease. It is the only antidepressant available in a transdermal delivery\nsystem.] Use of MAOIs is limited due to the complicated dietary restrictions required while taking these agents.\n405\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 406 ---\n\nA.  Mechanism of action\nMost MAOIs, such as phenelzine, form stable complexes with the enzyme, causing irreversible inactivation. This\nresults in increased stores of norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine within the neuron and subsequent diffusion of\nexcess neurotransmitter into the synaptic space (Figure 10.9). These drugs inhibit not only MAO in the brain but\nalso MAO in the liver and gut that catalyzes oxidative deamination of drugs and potentially toxic substances, such as\ntyramine, which is found in certain foods. The MAOIs, therefore, show a high incidence of drug–drug and drug–\nfood interactions. Selegiline administered as the transdermal patch may produce less inhibition of gut and hepatic\nMAO at low doses because it avoids first-pass metabolism.\n406\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 407 ---\n\n407\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 408 ---\n\nFigure 10.9 Mechanism of action of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).\n408\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 409 ---\n\nB.  Actions\nAlthough MAO is fully inhibited after several days of treatment, the antidepressant action of the MAOIs, like that of\nthe SSRIs, SNRIs, and TCAs, is delayed several weeks. Selegiline and tranylcypromine have an amphetamine-like\nstimulant effect that may produce agitation or insomnia.\n409\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 410 ---\n\nC.  Therapeutic uses\nThe MAOIs are indicated for depressed patients who are unresponsive or intolerant of other antidepressants.\nBecause of their risk for drug–drug and drug–food interactions, the MAOIs are considered last-line agents in many\ntreatment settings.\n410\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 411 ---\n\nD.  Pharmacokinetics\nThese drugs are well absorbed after oral administration. Enzyme regeneration, when irreversibly inactivated, varies,\nbut it usually occurs several weeks after termination of the drug. Thus, when switching antidepressant agents, a\nminimum of 2 weeks of delay must be allowed after termination of MAOI therapy and the initiation of another\nantidepressant from any other class. MAOIs are hepatically metabolized and excreted rapidly in urine.\n411\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 412 ---\n\nE.  Adverse effects\nSevere and often unpredictable side effects, due to drug–food and drug–drug interactions, limit the widespread use\nof MAOIs. For example, tyramine, which is contained in foods, such as aged cheeses and meats, liver, pickled or\nsmoked fish, and red wines, is normally inactivated by MAO in the gut. Individuals receiving a MAOI are unable to\ndegrade tyramine obtained from the diet. Tyramine causes the release of large amounts of stored catecholamines\nfrom nerve terminals, resulting in a hypertensive crisis, with signs and symptoms such as occipital headache, stiff\nneck, tachycardia, nausea, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and, possibly, stroke. Patients must,\ntherefore, be educated to avoid tyramine-containing foods. Other possible adverse effects of treatment with MAOIs\ninclude drowsiness, orthostatic hypotension, blurred vision, dry mouth, and constipation. SSRIs should not be\ncoadministered with MAOIs due to the risk of serotonin syndrome. Both SSRIs and MAOIs require a washout\nperiod of at least 2 weeks before the other type is administered, with the exception of fluoxetine, which should be\ndiscontinued at least 6 weeks before an MAOI is initiated. In addition, the MAOIs have many other critical drug\ninteractions, and caution is required when administering these agents concurrently with other drugs. Figure 10.10\nsummarizes the side effects of the antidepressant drugs.\n412\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 413 ---\n\n413\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 414 ---\n\nFigure 10.10 Side effects of some drugs used to treat depression.\n414\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 415 ---\n\nVIII.  Serotonin–Dopamine Antagonists\nWhile 60% to 80% of patients respond favorably to antidepressants, 20% to 40% experience a partial or poor\nresponse to monotherapy. The serotonin–dopamine antagonists (SDAs), or atypical antipsychotics, are occasionally\nused as adjunctive treatments to antidepressants in partial responders. Aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, quetiapine, and\nthe combination of fluoxetine and olanzapine are approved for use as adjuncts in major depressive disorder (MDD).\n415\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 416 ---\n\nXI.  Treatment of Mania and Bipolar Disorder\nThe treatment of bipolar disorder has increased in recent years due to increased recognition of the disorder and also\nan increase in the number of available medications for the treatment of mania.\n416\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 417 ---\n\nA.  Lithium\nLithium salts are used acutely and prophylactically for managing bipolar patients. Lithium is effective in treating\n60% to 80% of patients exhibiting mania and hypomania. Although many cellular processes are altered by treatment\nwith lithium, the mode of action is unknown. The therapeutic index of lithium is extremely low, and lithium can be\ntoxic. Common adverse effects may include headache, dry mouth, polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, GI distress, fine\nhand tremor, dizziness, fatigue, dermatologic reactions, and sedation. Adverse effects due to higher plasma levels\nmay indicate toxicity and include ataxia, slurred speech, coarse tremors, confusion, and convulsions. Thyroid\nfunction may be decreased and should be monitored. Lithium is renally eliminated, and though caution should be\nused when dosing this drug in renally impaired patients, it may be the best choice in patients with hepatic\nimpairment.\n417\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 418 ---\n\nB.

After 6 weeks of therapy with fluoxetine, his\nsymptoms improved, but he complains of sexual dysfunction. Which of the following drugs might be useful\nfor management of depression in this patient?\nA.  Sertraline\nB.  Citalopram\nC.  Mirtazapine\nD.  Lithium\nCorrect answer = C. Mirtazapine is largely free from sexual side effects. However, sexual dysfunction commonly\noccurs with SSRIs (sertraline and citalopram), as well as with TCAs and SNRIs. Lithium is used for the treatment\nof mania and bipolar disorder.\nA 25-year-old woman has a long history of depressive symptoms accompanied by body aches and pain\nsecondary to a car accident. Which of the following drugs might be useful in this patient?\nA.  Fluoxetine\nB.  Sertraline\nC.  Phenelzine\nD.  Duloxetine\nCorrect answer = D. Duloxetine is an SNRI that can be used for depression accompanied by symptoms of pain.\nSSRIs (fluoxetine and sertraline) and MAOIs (phenelzine) have little activity against pain syndromes.\nA 51-year-old woman with symptoms of major depression also has angle-closure glaucoma. Which\nantidepressant should be avoided in this patient?\nA.  Amitriptyline\nB.  Bupropion\nC.  Mirtazapine\nD.  Fluvoxamine\nCorrect answer = A. Because of its potent antimuscarinic activity, amitriptyline should not be given to patients\nwith glaucoma because of the risk of acute increases in intraocular pressure. The other antidepressants all lack\nantagonist activity at the muscarinic receptor.\nA 36-year-old man presents with symptoms of compulsive behavior. He realizes that his behavior is\ninterfering with his ability to accomplish his daily tasks but cannot seem to stop himself. Which drug would\nbe most helpful to this patient?\nA.  Desipramine\nB.  Paroxetine\nC.  Amitriptyline\nD.  Selegiline\nCorrect answer = B. SSRIs are particularly effective in treating obsessive–compulsive disorder, and paroxetine is\napproved for this condition. The other drugs are less effective in the treatment of obsessive–compulsive disorder.\nWhich antidepressant has, as its two proposed principal mechanisms of action, 5-HT1a receptor partial\nagonism and 5-HT reuptake inhibition?\nA.  Fluoxetine\nB.  Aripiprazole\nC.  Maprotiline\nD.  Vilazodone\nCorrect answer = D. In addition to inhibition of serotonin reuptake, the antidepressant activity of vilazodone may\nbe related to its 5-HT1a receptor agonism. Though aripiprazole is also proposed to have 5-HT1a partial agonism, it\nis not a serotonin reuptake inhibitor.\nWhich antidepressant is the most sedating?\nA.  Bupropion\nB.  Duloxetine\nC.  Doxepin\nD.  Venlafaxine\nCorrect answer = C. Doxepin is the most sedating of the list due to its histamine-blocking activity.419\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 420 ---\n\n10.7\n10.8\n10.9\n10.10Which mood stabilizer is completely renally eliminated and may be beneficial for patients with hepatic\nimpairment?\nA.  Valproic acid\nB.  Carbamazepine\nC.  Lithium\nD.  Risperidone\nCorrect answer = C. Lithium is the only agent for bipolar disorder that does not require hepatic metabolism and,\nthus, may be dosed without issue in a hepatically impaired patient. However, if the patient had renal impairment,\nthe lithium dosage would have to be adjusted.\nWhich antidepressant has, as its two principal mechanisms of action, 5-HT2A receptor antagonism and α2\nreceptor antagonism?\nA.  Fluoxetine\nB.  Doxepin\nC.  Maprotiline\nD.  Mirtazapine\nCorrect answer = D. Mirtazapine is the only antidepressant with this combination of mechanisms of action that\nare believed to contribute to its therapeutic effects.\nWhich mood-stabilizing agent is most likely to decrease the thyroid function?\nA.  Carbamazepine\nB.  Lithium\nC.  Valproic acid\nD.  Chlorpromazine\nCorrect answer = B. Lithium is best known for causing a drug-induced hypothyroidism in patients after long-term\nuse. Though it is possible with other mood stabilizers, lithium has the most reported cases, and thus, thyroid\nfunction tests should be performed at baseline and during follow-up to monitor for this possible effect.\nWhich antidepressant agent has significant α1 receptor antagonism and, thus, is a poor choice in an elderly\nfemale with depressive symptoms due to a higher risk of falls related to orthostatic hypotension?\nA.  Venlafaxine\nB.  Bupropion\nC.  Escitalopram\nD.  Amitriptyline\nCorrect answer = D. Venlafaxine, bupropion, and escitalopram have very little effect on decreasing blood\npressure (no α1 receptor antagonism) and are considered acceptable choices for treatment of depression in the\nelderly. Amitriptyline is associated with a high risk for orthostasis in the elderly and should be avoided due to its\nadverse effect profile and risk for falls.\n420\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 421 ---\n\n11\nAntipsychotic Drugs\nJose A. Rey\n421\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 422 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nThe antipsychotic drugs are used primarily to treat schizophrenia, but they are also effective in other psychotic and\nmanic states. The use of antipsychotic medications involves a difficult trade-off between the benefit of alleviating\npsychotic symptoms and the risk of a wide variety of adverse effects. Antipsychotic drugs (Figure 11.1) are not\ncurative and do not eliminate chronic thought disorders, but they often decrease the intensity of hallucinations and\ndelusions and permit the person with schizophrenia to function in a supportive environment.\n422\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 423 ---\n\nFigure 11.1 Summary of antipsychotic agents.\n423\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 424 ---\n\nII.  Schizophrenia\nSchizophrenia is a type of chronic psychosis characterized by delusions, hallucinations (often in the form of voices),\nand disturbances in thought. The onset of illness is often during late adolescence or early adulthood. It occurs in\nabout 1% of the population and is a chronic and disabling disorder. Schizophrenia has a strong genetic component\nand probably reflects some fundamental developmental and biochemical abnormality, possibly a dysfunction of the\nmesolimbic or mesocortical dopaminergic neuronal pathways.\n424\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 425 ---\n\nIII.  Antipsychotic Drugs\nThe antipsychotic drugs are usually divided into first- and second-generation agents. The first-generation drugs are\nfurther classified as “low potency” or “high potency.” This classification does not indicate clinical effectiveness of\nthe drugs but rather specifies affinity for the dopamine D2 receptor, which, in turn, may influence the adverse effect\nprofile of the drug.\n425\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 426 ---\n\nA.  First-generation antipsychotics\nThe first-generation antipsychotic drugs (also called conventional) are competitive inhibitors at a variety of\nreceptors, but their antipsychotic effects reflect competitive blockade of dopamine D2 receptors. First-generation\nantipsychotics are more likely to be associated with movement disorders known as extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS),\nparticularly drugs that bind tightly to dopaminergic neuroreceptors, such as haloperidol  [HAL-oh-PER-i-dol].\nMovement disorders are somewhat less likely with medications that bind less potently, such as chlorpromazine\n[klor-PROE-ma-zeen]. No one drug is clinically more effective than another.\n426\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 427 ---\n\nB.  Second-generation antipsychotic drugs\nThe second-generation antipsychotic drugs (also called “atypical” antipsychotics) have a lower incidence of EPS\nthan the first-generation agents but are associated with a higher risk of metabolic adverse effects, such as diabetes,\nhypercholesterolemia, and weight gain. The second-generation drugs owe their unique activity to blockade of both\nserotonin and dopamine receptors.\n1.  Drug selection\nSecond-generation agents are generally used as first-line therapy for schizophrenia to minimize the risk of\ndebilitating EPS associated with the first-generation drugs that act primarily at the dopamine D2 receptor. The\nsecond-generation antipsychotics exhibit an efficacy that is equivalent to, and occasionally exceeds, that of the first-\ngeneration antipsychotic agents. Differences in therapeutic efficacy among the second-generation drugs have not\nbeen established, and individual patient response and comorbid conditions must often be used to guide drug\nselection.\n2.  Refractory patients\nApproximately 10% to 20% of patients with schizophrenia have an insufficient response to first- and second-\ngeneration antipsychotics. For these patients, clozapine [KLOE-za-peen] has shown to be an effective antipsychotic\nwith a minimal risk of EPS. However, its clinical use is limited to refractory patients because of serious adverse\neffects. Clozapine can produce bone marrow suppression, seizures, and cardiovascular side effects, such as\northostasis. The risk of severe agranulocytosis necessitates frequent monitoring of white blood cell counts.\n427\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 428 ---\n\nC.  Mechanism of action\n1.  Dopamine antagonism\nAll of the first-generation and most of the second-generation antipsychotic drugs block D2 dopamine receptors in the\nbrain and the periphery (Figure 11.2).\nFigure 11.2 Dopamine-blocking actions of antipsychotic drugs.\n2.  Serotonin receptor–blocking activity\nMost of the second-generation agents exert part of their action through inhibition of serotonin receptors (5-HT),\nparticularly 5-HT2A receptors. Clozapine has high affinity for D1, D4, 5-HT2, muscarinic, and α-adrenergic\n428\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 429 ---\n\nreceptors, but it is also a weak dopamine D2 receptor antagonist (Figure 11.3). Risperidone [ris-PER-ih-dohn] blocks\n5-HT2A receptors to a greater extent than it does D2 receptors, as does olanzapine [oh-LANZ-ah-peen]. The second-\ngeneration antipsychotics aripiprazole [a-rih-PIP-ra-zole], brexpiprazole [brex-PIP-ra-zole], and cariprazine [kar-\nIP-ra-zeen] are partial agonists at D2 and 5-HT1A receptors, as well as antagonists of 5-HT2A receptors. Quetiapine\n[qwe-TY-uh-peen] is relatively weak at blockade of D2 and 5-HT2A receptors. Its low risk for EPS may also be\nrelated to the relatively short period of time it binds to the D2 receptor. Pimavanserin [pim-a-VAN-ser-in] appears to\nact as an inverse agonist and antagonist at the 5-HT2A receptor and the 5-HT2C receptor, with no appreciable affinity\nfor dopamine receptors. Pimavanserin is indicated for psychosis associated with Parkinson disease.\nFigure 11.3 Relative affinities of clozapine , chlorpromazine, and haloperidol at D1 and\nD2 dopaminergic receptors.\n429\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 430 ---\n\n430\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 431 ---\n\nD.  Actions\nThe clinical effects of antipsychotic drugs reflect a blockade at dopamine and/or serotonin receptors. However,\nmany antipsychotic agents also block cholinergic, adrenergic, and histaminergic receptors (Figure 11.4). It is\nunknown what role, if any, these actions have in alleviating the symptoms of psychosis. However, the undesirable\nadverse effects of antipsychotic drugs often result from pharmacological actions at these other receptors.\nFigure 11.4 Antipsychotic drugs block dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors as well\nas adrenergic, cholinergic, and histamine-binding receptors.\n1.  Antipsychotic effects\nAll antipsychotic drugs can reduce hallucinations and delusions associated with schizophrenia (known as “positive”\nsymptoms) by blocking D2 receptors in the mesolimbic system of the brain. The “negative” symptoms, such as\nblunted affect, apathy, and impaired attention, as well as cognitive impairment, are not as responsive to therapy,\nparticularly with the first-generation antipsychotics. Many second-generation agents, such as clozapine, can\nameliorate the negative symptoms to some extent.\n2.  Extrapyramidal effects\nDystonias (sustained contraction of muscles leading to twisting, distorted postures), Parkinson-like symptoms,\nakathisia (motor restlessness), and tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements, usually of the tongue, lips, neck,\ntrunk, and limbs) can occur with both acute and chronic treatment. Blockade of dopamine receptors in the\nnigrostriatal pathway is believed to cause these unwanted movement symptoms. The second-generation\nantipsychotics exhibit a lower incidence of EPS.\n3.  Antiemetic effects\nThe antipsychotic drugs have antiemetic effects that are mediated by blocking D2 receptors of the chemoreceptor\ntrigger zone of the medulla (see",

Anticholinergic effects\nSome of the antipsychotics, particularly thioridazine [THYE-oh-RID-a-zeen], chlorpromazine, clozapine, and\nolanzapine, produce anticholinergic effects. These effects include blurred vision, dry mouth (the exception is\nclozapine, which increases salivation), confusion, and inhibition of gastrointestinal and urinary tract smooth muscle,\nleading to constipation and urinary retention. The anticholinergic effects may actually assist in reducing the risk of\nEPS with these agents.\n5.  Other effects\nBlockade of α-adrenergic receptors causes orthostatic hypotension and light-headedness. The antipsychotics also\nalter temperature-regulating mechanisms and can produce poikilothermia (condition in which body temperature\nvaries with the environment). In the pituitary, antipsychotics that block D2 receptors may cause an increase in\nprolactin release. Sedation occurs with those drugs that are potent antagonists of the H1-histamine receptor,\nincluding chlorpromazine, olanzapine, quetiapine, and clozapine. Sexual dysfunction may also occur with the\nantipsychotics due to various receptor-binding characteristics. Weight gain is also a common adverse effect of\nantipsychotics and is more significant with the second-generation agents.\n433\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 434 ---\n\nE.  Therapeutic uses\n1.  Treatment of schizophrenia\nThe antipsychotics are the only efficacious pharmacological treatment for schizophrenia. The first-generation\nantipsychotics are generally most effective in treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. The atypical\nantipsychotics with 5-HT2A receptor–blocking activity may be effective in many patients who are resistant to the\ntraditional agents, especially in treating the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.\n2.  Prevention of nausea and vomiting\nThe older antipsychotics (most commonly, prochlorperazine [PROE-klor-PER-a-zeen]) are useful in the treatment\nof drug-induced nausea.\n3.  Other uses\nThe antipsychotic drugs can be used as tranquilizers to manage agitated and disruptive behavior secondary to other\ndisorders. Chlorpromazine is used to treat intractable hiccups. Pimozide [PIM-oh-zide] is primarily indicated for\ntreatment of the motor and phonic tics of Tourette disorder. However, risperidone and haloperidol  are also\ncommonly prescribed for this tic disorder. Also, risperidone and aripiprazole are approved for the management of\ndisruptive behavior and irritability secondary to autism. Many antipsychotic agents are approved for the\nmanagement of the manic and mixed symptoms associated with bipolar disorder. Lurasidone [loo-RAS-i-done] and\nquetiapine are indicated for the treatment of bipolar depression. Paliperidone [pal-ee-PER-i-dohn] is approved for\nthe treatment of schizoaffective disorder. Some antipsychotics (aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, and quetiapine) are used\nas adjunctive agents with antidepressants for treatment-refractory depression.\n434\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 435 ---\n\nF.  Absorption and metabolism\nAfter oral administration, the antipsychotics show variable absorption that is unaffected by food (except for\nziprasidone [zi-PRAS-i-done], lurasidone, and paliperidone, the absorption of which is increased with food). These\nagents readily pass into the brain and have a large volume of distribution. They are metabolized to many different\nmetabolites, usually by the cytochrome P-450 system in the liver, particularly the CYP2D6, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4\nisoenzymes. Some metabolites are active and have been developed as pharmacological agents themselves (for\nexample, paliperidone is the active metabolite of risperidone, and the antidepressant amoxapine is the active\nmetabolite of loxapine). Fluphenazine decanoate, haloperidol decanoate, risperidone microspheres, paliperidone\npalmitate, aripiprazole monohydrate, aripiprazole lauroxil , and olanzapine pamoate are long-acting injectable\n(LAI) formulations of antipsychotics. These formulations usually have a therapeutic duration of action of 2 to 4\nweeks, with some having a duration of 6 to 12 weeks. Therefore, these LAI formulations are often used to treat\noutpatients and individuals who are nonadherent with oral medications.\n435\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 436 ---\n\nG.  Adverse effects\nAdverse effects of the antipsychotic drugs can occur in practically all patients and are significant in about 80%\n(Figure 11.6).\n436\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 437 ---\n\n437\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 438 ---\n\nFigure 11.6 Adverse effects observed in individuals treated with antipsychotic drugs.\n1.  Extrapyramidal effects\nThe inhibitory effects of dopaminergic neurons are normally balanced by the excitatory actions of cholinergic\nneurons in the striatum. Blocking dopamine receptors alters this balance, causing a relative excess of cholinergic\ninfluence, which results in extrapyramidal motor effects. The appearance of the movement disorders is generally\ntime- and dose dependent, with dystonias occurring within a few hours to days of treatment, followed by akathisias\noccurring within days to weeks. Parkinson-like symptoms of bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor usually occur within\nweeks to months of initiating treatment. Tardive dyskinesia (see below), which can be irreversible, may occur after\nmonths or years of treatment.\nIf cholinergic activity is also blocked, a new, more nearly normal balance is restored, and extrapyramidal effects\nare minimized. This can be achieved by administration of an anticholinergic drug, such as benztropine [BENZ-troe-\npeen]. The therapeutic trade-off is a lower incidence of EPS in exchange for the adverse effect of muscarinic\nreceptor blockade. Akathisia may respond better to β-blockers (for example, propranolol ) or benzodiazepines, rather\nthan anticholinergic medications.\n2.  Tardive dyskinesia\nLong-term treatment with antipsychotics can cause this motor disorder. Patients display involuntary movements,\nincluding bilateral and facial jaw movements and “fly-catching” motions of the tongue. A prolonged holiday from\nantipsychotics may cause the symptoms to diminish or disappear within a few months. However, in many\nindividuals, tardive dyskinesia is irreversible and persists after discontinuation of therapy. Tardive dyskinesia is\npostulated to result from an increased number of dopamine receptors that are synthesized as a compensatory\nresponse to long-term dopamine receptor blockade. This makes the neuron supersensitive to the actions of\ndopamine, and it allows the dopaminergic input to this structure to overpower the cholinergic input, causing excess\nmovement in the patient. Traditional anti-EPS medications may actually worsen this condition. Valbenazine [val-\nBEN-a-zeen] and deutetrabenazine [doo-TET-ra-BEN-a-zeen] are inhibitors of the vesicular monoamine\ntransporter, and they are indicated for the management of tardive dyskinesia. These agents cause a decreased uptake\nof monoamines into synaptic vesicles and depletion of monoamine stores, ideally focused on dopamine, to address\nthe symptoms of tardive dyskinesia.\n3.  Neuroleptic malignant syndrome\nThis potentially fatal reaction to antipsychotic drugs is characterized by muscle rigidity, fever, altered mental status\nand stupor, unstable blood pressure, and myoglobinemia. Treatment necessitates discontinuation of the antipsychotic\nagent and supportive therapy. Administration of dantrolene or bromocriptine may be helpful.\n4.  Other effects\nDrowsiness occurs during the first few weeks of treatment. These agents may also cause confusion. Those\nantipsychotics with potent antimuscarinic activity often produce dry mouth, urinary retention, constipation, and loss\nof visual accommodation. Others may block α-adrenergic receptors, resulting in lowered blood pressure and\northostatic hypotension. The antipsychotics depress the hypothalamus, thereby affecting thermoregulation and\ncausing amenorrhea, galactorrhea, gynecomastia, infertility, and erectile dysfunction. Significant weight gain is\noften a reason for nonadherence. Glucose and lipid profiles should be monitored in patients taking antipsychotics, as\nthe second-generation agents may increase these laboratory parameters and possibly exacerbate preexisting diabetes\nor hyperlipidemia. Some antipsychotics have been associated with mild to significant QT prolongation. Thioridazine\nhas the highest risk, and ziprasidone and iloperidone [eye-low-PER-ee-dohn] also have cautions with their use due\nto this effect. Other antipsychotics have a general precaution regarding QT prolongation, even if the risk is relatively\nlow.\n5.  Cautions and contraindications\nAll antipsychotics may lower the seizure threshold and should be used cautiously in patients with seizure disorders\nor those with an increased risk for seizures, such as withdrawal from alcohol. These agents also carry the warning of\nincreased risk for mortality when used in elderly patients with dementia-related behavioral disturbances and\npsychosis. Antipsychotics used in patients with mood disorders should also be monitored for worsening of mood and\nsuicidal ideation or behaviors.438\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 439 ---\n\nH.  Maintenance treatment\nPatients who have had two or more psychotic episodes secondary to schizophrenia should receive maintenance\ntherapy for at least 5 years, and some experts prefer indefinite therapy. The rate of relapse may be lower with\nsecond-generation drugs (Figure 11.7). Figure 11.8 summarizes the therapeutic uses of some of the antipsychotic\ndrugs.\nFigure 11.7 Rates of relapse among patients with schizophrenia after maintenance\ntherapy with either risperidone or haloperidol.\n439\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 440 ---\n\nFigure 11.8 Summary of antipsychotic agents commonly used to treat schizophrenia.\nEPS = extrapyramidal effects; LAI = long-acting injectable.\n440\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 441 ---\n\n11.1\n11.2\n11.3\n11.4\n11.5\n11.6Study Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nAn adolescent male is newly diagnosed with schizophrenia. Which antipsychotic agent may have the best\nchance to improve his apathy and blunted affect?\nA.  Chlorpromazine\nB.  Fluphenazine\nC.  Haloperidol\nD.  Risperidone\nCorrect answer = D. Risperidone is the only antipsychotic on the list that has some reported benefit in improving\nthe negative symptoms of schizophrenia. All of the agents have the potential to diminish the hallucinations and\ndelusional thought processes (positive symptoms).\nWhich of the following antipsychotics is a partial agonist at the dopamine D2 receptor?\nA.  Brexpiprazole\nB.  Clozapine\nC.  Haloperidol\nD.  Risperidone\nCorrect answer = A. Brexpiprazole is the only agent listed that acts as a partial agonist at D2 receptors.\nTheoretically, the drug enhances action at these receptors under low dopamine conditions and blocks activation\nwhen dopamine levels are high. All of the other drugs are antagonistic at D2 receptors.\nA 21-year-old man has recently begun pimozide therapy for Tourette disorder. He has been having\n“different-appearing tics,” such as prolonged contraction of the facial muscles, and he experiences\nopisthotonos (extrapyramidal spasm of the body in which the head and heels are bent backward and the body\nis bowed forward). Which of the following drugs would be beneficial in reducing these symptoms?\nA.  Benztropine\nB.  Bromocriptine\nC.  Prochlorperazine\nD.  Risperidone\nCorrect answer = A. The patient is experiencing EPS due to pimozide, and a muscarinic antagonist such as\nbenztropine would be effective in reducing the symptoms. The other drugs would have no effect or, in the case of\nprochlorperazine and risperidone, might increase the adverse symptoms.\nA 28-year-old woman with schizoaffective disorder (combination of mood and psychotic symptoms) reports\ndifficulty falling asleep. Which of the following would be most beneficial in this patient?\nA.  Olanzapine\nB.  Haloperidol\nC.  Paliperidone\nD.  Ziprasidone\nCorrect answer = C. Paliperidone is the only agent that is approved for schizoaffective disorder. Olanzapine has\nsignificant sedative activity as well as antipsychotic properties and is the drug most likely to alleviate this\npatient’s report of insomnia. Although other antipsychotics may benefit this patient’s disorder, paliperidone has\nthe indication for this disorder, and if the underlying disorder is improved, then the symptom of insomnia may\nalso improve without risking other unwanted adverse effects, such as the weight gain associated with olanzapine.\nWhich of the following antipsychotic agents is considered to be the most potent and thus have the highest\nrisk of extrapyramidal symptoms?\nA.  Thioridazine\nB.  Haloperidol\nC.  Quetiapine\nD.  Chlorpromazine\nCorrect answer = B. Among the older, conventional, or typical antipsychotics on this list, haloperidol is the most\npotent and would thus be expected to have the highest incidence of EPS. The atypical antipsychotics listed\n(quetiapine) could be considered low potency based on their common dosing and are considered to have the\nlowest risk for EPS.\nWhich antipsychotic has the most sedative potential and is sometimes, questionably, used as a hypnotic agent\nin certain clinical settings?\nA.  Fluphenazine\nB.  Thiothixene441\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 442 ---\n\n11.7\n11.8\n11.9\n11.10C.  Quetiapine\nD.  Haloperidol\nCorrect answer = C. Quetiapine has strong antihistaminergic effects causing sedation and is sometimes used at\nlow doses as a sedative–hypnotic, even though this use is considered off-label. The other antipsychotic agents\nlisted are weaker at blocking the histamine receptor and therefore are not as sedating.\nA 30-year-old male patient is treated with haloperidol for schizophrenia. His psychotic symptoms are well\nmanaged with haloperidol; however, he is reporting restlessness, the inability to sit still at the dinner table,\nand his family notices that he frequently paces the hallway. Which is the best agent to treat this\nantipsychotic-induced akathisia?\nA.  Benztropine\nB.  Dantrolene\nC.  Bromocriptine\nD.  Propranolol\nCorrect answer = D. Propranolol, a β-blocker, is considered the drug of choice for the management of\nantipsychotic-induced akathisia. Benztropine is more effective for pseudoparkinsonism and acute dystonias.\nBromocriptine is more effective for Parkinson-like symptoms, and dantrolene is a muscle relaxant that is best\nreserved for managing some symptoms of neuroleptic malignant syndrome.\nWhich antipsychotic agent is available in an LAI formulation that may be useful for patients with difficulty\nadhering to therapy?\nA.  Asenapine\nB.  Chlorpromazine\nC.  Clozapine\nD.  Aripiprazole\nCorrect answer = D. Aripiprazole is available in two different LAI formulations. The other agents listed do not\nhave LAI formulations. Risperidone, fluphenazine, haloperidol, olanzapine, and paliperidone are other\nantipsychotics that are available in LAI formulations.\nWhich antipsychotic agent is most associated with the possibility of a hematological dyscrasia such as\nagranulocytosis in a patient being treated for schizophrenia?\nA.  Chlorpromazine\nB.  Buspirone\nC.  Lithium\nD.  Clozapine\nCorrect answer = D. Clozapine is the only antipsychotic medication that has a black box warning and a risk of\nagranulocytosis in approximately 1% of the patients treated. This requires regular monitoring of white blood cell\ncounts. Although other antipsychotics have case reports of blood dyscrasias, clozapine is considered to have the\nhighest risk.\nWhich antipsychotic agent has been most associated with significant QT interval prolongation and should be\nused with caution in patients with preexisting arrhythmias or patients taking other drugs associated with QT\nprolongation?\nA.  Thioridazine\nB.  Risperidone\nC.  Asenapine\nD.  Lurasidone\nCorrect answer = A. Of the antipsychotic drugs listed, thioridazine has the highest risk for causing QT interval\nprolongation. Although this is a general warning for many antipsychotics, thioridazine has been issued a “black\nbox warning,” suggesting that it is associated with the greatest risk.442\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 443 ---\n\n12\nDrugs for Epilepsy\nJeannine M. Conway and Angela K. Birnbaum\n443\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 444 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nApproximately 10% of the population has at least one seizure in their lifetime. Globally, epilepsy is the fourth most\ncommon neurologic disorder after migraine, cerebrovascular disease (stroke), and Alzheimer’s disease. Epilepsy is\nnot a single entity but an assortment of different seizure types and syndromes originating from several mechanisms\nthat have in common the sudden, excessive, and synchronous discharge of cerebral neurons. This abnormal\nelectrical activity may result in a variety of events, including loss of consciousness, abnormal movements, atypical\nor odd behavior, and distorted perceptions that are of limited duration but recur if untreated. The site of origin of\nabnormal neuronal firing determines the symptoms that occur. For example, if the motor cortex is involved, the\npatient may experience abnormal movements or a generalized convulsion. Seizures originating in the parietal or\noccipital lobe may include visual, auditory, and olfactory hallucinations. Medications are the most widely used\nmode of treatment for patients with epilepsy. In general, seizures can be controlled with one medication in\napproximately 75% of patients. Patients may require more than one medication in order to optimize seizure control,\nand some patients may never obtain total seizure control. A summary of antiseizure medications is shown in Figure\n12.1.\n444\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 445 ---\n\nFigure 12.1 Summary of agents used in the treatment of epilepsy.\n445\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 446 ---\n\nII.  Etiology of Seizures\nEpilepsy can be due to an underlying genetic, structural, or metabolic cause or an unknown etiology. In most cases,\nepilepsy has no identifiable cause. The neuronal discharge in epilepsy results from firing of a small population of\nneurons in a specific area of the brain referred to as the “primary focus.” Focal areas that are functionally abnormal\nmay be triggered into activity by changes in physiologic factors, such as an alteration in blood gases, pH,\nelectrolytes, and blood glucose and changes in environmental factors, such as sleep deprivation, alcohol intake, and\nstress. A number of causes, such as illicit drug use, tumor, head injury, hypoglycemia, meningeal infection, and the\nrapid withdrawal of alcohol from an alcoholic, can precipitate seizures. In cases when the source of a seizure can be\ndetermined and corrected, medication may not be necessary. For example, a seizure that is caused by a drug reaction\nis not epilepsy and does not require chronic therapy. In other situations, antiseizure medications may be needed\nwhen the primary cause of the seizures cannot be corrected. Though multiple specific epilepsy syndromes that\ninclude symptoms other than seizures have been classified, a discussion of these syndromes is beyond the scope of\nthis chapter.\n446\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 447 ---\n\nIII.  Classification of Seizures\nIt is important to correctly classify seizures to determine appropriate treatment. Seizures have been categorized by\nsite of origin, etiology, electrophysiologic correlation, and clinical presentation. Nomenclature developed by the\nInternational League Against Epilepsy is considered the standard classification for seizures and epilepsy syndromes\n(Figure 12.2). Seizures have been classified into two broad groups: focal and generalized.\nFigure 12.2 Classification of epilepsy.\n447\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 448 ---\n\nA.  Focal\nFocal seizures involve only a portion of one hemisphere of the brain. The symptoms of each seizure type depend on\nthe site of neuronal discharge and on the extent to which the electrical activity spreads to other neurons in the brain.\nFocal seizures may progress to become bilateral tonic–clonic seizures. Patients may lose consciousness or\nawareness. This seizure type may begin with a motor or nonmotor activity.\n448\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 449 ---\n\nB.  Generalized\nGeneralized seizures may begin locally and then progress to include abnormal electrical discharges throughout both\nhemispheres of the brain. Primary generalized seizures may be convulsive or nonconvulsive, and the patient usually\nhas an immediate loss of consciousness.\n1.  Tonic–clonic\nThese seizures result in loss of consciousness, followed by tonic (continuous contraction) and clonic (rapid\ncontraction and relaxation) phases. The seizure may be followed by a period of confusion and exhaustion due to\ndepletion of glucose and energy stores.\n2.  Absence\nThese seizures involve a brief, abrupt, and self-limiting loss of consciousness. The onset generally occurs in patients\nat 3 to 5 years of age and lasts until puberty or beyond. The patient stares and exhibits rapid eye blinking, which\nlasts for 3 to 5 seconds. An absence seizure has a very distinct three-per-second spike and wave discharge seen on\nelectroencephalogram.\n3.  Myoclonic\nThese seizures consist of short episodes of muscle contractions that may recur for several minutes. They generally\noccur after wakening and exhibit as brief jerks of the limbs. Myoclonic seizures occur at any age but usually begin\naround puberty or early adulthood.\n4.  Clonic\nThese seizures consist of short episodes of muscle contractions that may closely resemble myoclonic seizures.\nConsciousness is more impaired with clonic seizures as compared to myoclonic.\n5.  Tonic\nThese seizures involve increased tone in the extension muscles and are generally less than 60 seconds.\n6.  Atonic\nThese seizures are also known as drop attacks and are characterized by a sudden loss of muscle tone.\n449\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 450 ---\n\nC.  Mechanism of action of antiseizure medications\nDrugs reduce seizures through mechanisms such as blocking voltage-gated channels (Na+ or Ca2+), enhancing\ninhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic impulses and interfering with excitatory glutamate transmission. Some\nantiseizure medications appear to have multiple targets within the central nervous system (CNS), whereas the\nmechanism of action for some agents is poorly defined. Antiseizure medications suppress seizures but do not “cure”\nor “prevent” epilepsy.\n450\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 451 ---\n\nIV.  Drug Selection\nChoice of drug treatment is based on the classification of the seizures, patient-specific variables (for example, age,\ncomorbid medical conditions, lifestyle, and personal preference), and characteristics of the drug (such as cost and\ndrug interactions). For example, focal-onset seizures are treated with a different set of medications than primary\ngeneralized seizures, although the list of effective agents overlaps. The toxicity of the agent and characteristics of\nthe patient are major considerations in drug selection. In newly diagnosed patients, monotherapy is instituted with a\nsingle agent until seizures are controlled or toxicity occurs (Figure 12.3). Compared with those receiving\ncombination therapy, patients receiving monotherapy exhibit better medication adherence and fewer side effects. If\nseizures are not controlled with the first medication, monotherapy with an alternate medication or the addition of\nmedications should be considered (Figure 12.4). Failing that, other medical management (vagal nerve stimulation,\nsurgery, etc.) should be considered. Awareness of the antiseizure medications available and their mechanisms of\naction, pharmacokinetics, potential for drug–drug interactions, and adverse effects is essential for successful\ntreatment of the patient.\n451\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 452 ---\n\n452\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 453 ---\n\nFigure 12.3 Therapeutic strategies for managing newly diagnosed epilepsy.\nFigure 12.4 Therapeutic indications for the antiseizure agents. Benzodiazepines =\ndiazepam and lorazepam.\n453\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 454 ---\n\nV.  Antiseizure Medications\nThe Food and Drug Administration has approved many new antiseizure medications in the last few decades. Some\nof these agents are thought to have potential advantages over older drugs in terms of pharmacokinetics, tolerability,\nand reduced risk for drug–drug interactions. However, studies have failed to demonstrate that the newer drugs are\nsignificantly more efficacious than are the older agents. Figure 12.5 summarizes pharmacokinetic properties of the\nantiseizure medications, and Figure 12.6 shows common adverse effects. Suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation\nhave been identified as a risk with antiseizure medications. In addition, virtually, all antiseizure medications have\nbeen associated with multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions, a rare idiosyncratic reaction characterized by rash, fever,\nand systemic organ involvement.\nFigure 12.5 Summary of the pharmacokinetics of antiseizure medications used as chronic\ntherapy.\n454\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 455 ---\n\n455\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 456 ---\n\nFigure 12.6 Notable adverse effects of antiseizure medications.\n456\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 457 ---\n\nA.  Benzodiazepines\nBenzodiazepines bind to GABA inhibitory receptors to reduce the firing rate. Most benzodiazepines are reserved for\nemergency or acute seizure treatment due to tolerance. However, clonazepam [kloe-NAY-ze-pam] and clobazam\n[KLOE-ba-zam] may be prescribed as adjunctive therapy for particular types of seizures. Diazepam [dye-AZ-e-pam]\nis also available for rectal administration to avoid or interrupt prolonged generalized tonic–clonic seizures or clusters\nwhen oral administration is not possible.\n457\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 458 ---\n\nB.  Brivaracetam\nBrivaracetam [briv-a-RA-se-tam] is approved for treatment of focal-onset seizures in adults. It demonstrates high\nand selective affinity for a synaptic vesicle protein (SV2A); however, the exact mechanism of antiseizure action is\nunknown. The drug is well absorbed after oral administration and metabolized by both hydrolysis and CYP2C19\n(minor). Comedication with strong CYP-inducing medications may lead to lower plasma concentrations.\nBrivaracetam is a moderate inhibitor of epoxide hydrolase, resulting in increased levels of the active metabolite of\ncarbamazepine when the drugs are coadministered.\n458\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 459 ---\n\nC.  Carbamazepine\nCarbamazepine [kar-ba-MAZ-a-peen] blocks sodium channels, thereby possibly inhibiting the generation of\nrepetitive action potentials in the epileptic focus and preventing spread. Carbamazepine is effective for treatment of\nfocal seizures, generalized tonic–clonic seizures, trigeminal neuralgia, and bipolar disorder. It induces its own\nmetabolism, resulting in lower total carbamazepine blood concentrations at higher doses. Carbamazepine is an\ninducer of the CYP1A2, CYP2C, CYP3A, and UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes, which increases the\nclearance of other drugs (Figure 12.7). Hyponatremia may be noted in some patients, especially the elderly, and may\nnecessitate a change in medication. Carbamazepine should not be prescribed for patients with absence seizures\nbecause it may cause an increase in seizures.\n459\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 460 ---\n\nFigure 12.7 CYP metabolism of the antiseizure medications.\n460\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 461 ---\n\n461\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 462 ---\n\nD.  Eslicarbazepine\nEslicarbazepine [es-li-kar-BAZ-a-peen] acetate is a prodrug that is converted to the active metabolite\neslicarbazepine (S-licarbazepine) by hydrolysis. S-licarbazepine is the active metabolite of oxcarbazepine. It is a\nvoltage-gated sodium channel blocker and is approved for focal seizures in adults. Eslicarbazepine exhibits linear\npharmacokinetics and is eliminated via glucuronidation. The side effect profile includes dizziness, somnolence,\ndiplopia, and headache. Serious adverse reactions such as rash, psychiatric side effects, and hyponatremia occur\nrarely.\n462\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 463 ---\n\nE.  Ethosuximide\nEthosuximide [eth-oh-SUX-i-mide] reduces propagation of abnormal electrical activity in the brain, most likely by\ninhibiting T-type calcium channels. It is most effective in treating absence seizures.\n463\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 464 ---\n\nF.  Felbamate\nFelbamate [FEL-ba-mate] has a broad spectrum of anticonvulsant action with multiple proposed mechanisms\nincluding the blocking of voltage-dependent sodium channels, competing with the glycine-binding site on the N-\nmethyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor, blocking of calcium channels, and potentiating GABA action. It is\nan inhibitor of drugs metabolized by CYP2C19 and induces drugs metabolized by CYP3A4. It is reserved for use in\nrefractory epilepsies (particularly Lennox-Gastaut syndrome) because of the risk of aplastic anemia (about 1:4000)\nand hepatic failure.\n464\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 465 ---\n\nG.  Gabapentin\nGabapentin [GA-ba-pen-tin] is an analog of GABA. However, it does not act at GABA receptors, enhance GABA\nactions or convert to GABA. Although gabapentin binds to the α2δ subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, the\nprecise mechanism of action is not known. It is approved as adjunct therapy for focal seizures and treatment of\npostherpetic neuralgia. Gabapentin exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics (see",

Reduced dosing is required in renal disease. Gabapentin is well tolerated by the elderly\npopulation with focal seizures due to its relatively mild adverse effects. It may also be a good choice for the older\npatient because there are few drug interactions.\n465\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 466 ---\n\nH.  Lacosamide\nLacosamide [la-KOE-sa-mide] affects voltage-gated sodium channels, resulting in stabilization of hyperexcitable\nneuronal membranes and inhibition of repetitive neuronal firing. Lacosamide binds to collapsin response mediator\nprotein-2 (CRMP-2), a phosphoprotein involved in neuronal differentiation and control of axonal outgrowth. The\nrole of CRMP-2 binding in seizure control is unknown. Lacosamide is approved for adjunctive treatment of focal\nseizures. The most common adverse events that limit treatment include dizziness, headache, and fatigue.\n466\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 467 ---\n\nI.  Lamotrigine\nLamotrigine [la-MOE-tri-jeen] blocks sodium channels and high voltage–dependent calcium channels. Lamotrigine\nis effective in a wide variety of seizure types, including focal, generalized, absence seizures, and Lennox-Gastaut\nsyndrome. It is also used to treat bipolar disorder. Lamotrigine is metabolized primarily to the 2-N-glucuronide\nmetabolite through the UGT1A4 pathway. As with other antiseizure medications, general inducers increase\nlamotrigine clearance leading to lower lamotrigine concentrations, whereas divalproex results in a significant\ndecrease in lamotrigine clearance (higher lamotrigine concentrations). Lamotrigine dosages should be reduced when\nadding valproate to therapy. Slow titration is necessary with lamotrigine (particularly when adding lamotrigine to a\nregimen that includes valproate) due to risk of rash, which may progress to a serious, life-threatening reaction.\n467\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 468 ---\n\nJ.  Levetiracetam\nLevetiracetam [lee-ve-tye-RA-se-tam] is approved for adjunct therapy of focal-onset, myoclonic, and primary\ngeneralized tonic–clonic seizures in adults and children. It demonstrates high affinity for a synaptic vesicle protein\n(SV2A). The drug is well absorbed after oral administration and is excreted in urine mostly unchanged, resulting in\nfew to no drug interactions. Levetiracetam can cause mood alterations that may require a dose reduction or a change\nof medication.\n468\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 469 ---\n\nK.  Oxcarbazepine\nOxcarbazepine [ox-kar-BAY-zeh-peen] is a prodrug that is rapidly reduced to the 10-monohydroxy (MHD)\nmetabolite responsible for its anticonvulsant activity. MHD blocks sodium channels and is thought to modulate\ncalcium channels. It is approved for use in adults and children with focal seizures. Oxcarbazepine is a less potent\ninducer of CYP3A4 and UGT than is carbamazepine. The adverse effect of hyponatremia limits its use in the\nelderly.\n469\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 470 ---\n\nL.  Perampanel\nPerampanel  [per-AM-pa-nel] is a selective α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid antagonist\nresulting in reduced excitatory activity. Perampanel  has a long half-life enabling once-daily dosing. It is approved\nfor adjunctive treatment of focal and generalized tonic–clonic seizures.

Gingival hyperplasia may cause the gums to grow over the\nteeth (Figure 12.9). Long-term use may lead to development of peripheral neuropathies and osteoporosis. Although\nphenytoin is advantageous due to its low cost, the actual cost of therapy may be higher, considering the potential for\nserious toxicity and adverse effects.\nFigure 12.8 Nonlinear effect of phenytoin dosage on the plasma concentration of the\ndrug.\n472\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 473 ---\n\nFigure 12.9 Gingival hyperplasia in patient treated with phenytoin.\nFosphenytoin [FOS-phen-i-toin] is a prodrug that is rapidly converted to phenytoin in the blood within minutes.\nWhereas fosphenytoin may be administered intramuscularly (IM), phenytoin sodium should never be given IM, as it\ncauses tissue damage and necrosis. Fosphenytoin is the drug of choice and standard of care for IV and IM\nadministration of phenytoin.\n473\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 474 ---\n\nO.  Pregabalin\nPregabalin [pree-GA-ba-lin] binds to the α2δ site, an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels in the\nCNS, inhibiting excitatory neurotransmitter release. The drug has proven effects on focal-onset seizures, diabetic\nperipheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, and fibromyalgia. More than 90% of pregabalin is eliminated renally.\nIt has no significant effects on drug metabolism and few drug interactions. Dosage adjustments are needed in renal\ndysfunction.\n474\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 475 ---\n\nP.  Rufinamide\nRufinamide [roo-FIN-a-mide] acts at sodium channels. It is approved for the adjunctive treatment of seizures\nassociated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in children one year of age and older and in adults. Rufinamide is a weak\ninhibitor of CYP2E1 and a weak inducer of CYP3A4 enzymes. Food increases absorption and peak serum\nconcentrations. Serum concentrations of rufinamide are affected by other antiseizure medications. Carbamazepine\nand phenytoi n can reduce and valproate can increase the serum concentrations of rufinamide. Adverse effects\ninclude the potential for shortened QT intervals. Patients with familial short QT syndrome should not be treated with\nrufinamide.\n475\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 476 ---\n\nQ.  Tiagabine\nTiagabine [ty-AG-a-been] blocks GABA uptake into presynaptic neurons permitting more GABA to be available for\nreceptor binding and thereby enhancing inhibitory activity. Tiagabine is effective as adjunctive treatment in focal\nseizures. In postmarketing surveillance, seizures have occurred in patients using tiagabine who did not have\nepilepsy. Tiagabine should not be used for indications other than epilepsy.\n476\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 477 ---\n\nR.  Topiramate\nTopiramate [toe-PEER-a-mate] has multiple mechanisms of action. It blocks voltage-dependent sodium channels,\nreduces high-voltage calcium currents (L type), is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, and may act at glutamate (NMDA)\nsites. Topiramate is effective for use in focal and primary generalized epilepsy. It is also approved for prevention of\nmigraine. It mildly inhibits CYP2C19 and coadministration with phenytoin and carbamazepine may reduce serum\nconcentrations of topiramate. Adverse effects include somnolence, weight loss, and paresthesias. Renal stones,\nglaucoma, oligohidrosis (decreased sweating), and hyperthermia have also been reported.\n477\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 478 ---\n\nS.  Valproic acid and divalproex\nPossible mechanisms of action include sodium channel blockade, blockade of GABA transaminase (GABA-T), and\naction at the T-type calcium channels. These varied mechanisms provide a broad spectrum of activity against\nseizures. It is effective for the treatment of focal and primary generalized epilepsies. Valproic acid [val-PRO-ik A-\nsid] is available as a free acid. Divalproex [dye-val-PRO-ex] sodium is a combination of sodium valproate [val-\nPROE-ate] and valproic acid that is converted to valproate ion in the gastrointestinal tract. It was developed to\nimprove gastrointestinal tolerance of valproic acid. All of the available salt forms are equivalent in efficacy\n(valproic acid and sodium valproate). Commercial products are available in multiple-salt dosage forms and\nextended-release formulations. Therefore, the risk for medication errors is high, and it is essential to be familiar with\nall preparations. Valproate inhibits metabolism of the CYP2C9, UGT, and epoxide hydrolase systems (Figure 12.7).\nRare hepatotoxicity may cause a rise in liver enzymes, which should be monitored frequently. Use in children under\nage 2 and women should be avoided if possible.\n478\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 479 ---\n\nT.  Vigabatrin\nVigabatrin [vye-GA-ba-trin] acts as an irreversible inhibitor of GABA-T. GABA-T is the enzyme responsible for\nmetabolism of GABA. Vigabatrin is associated with visual field loss ranging from mild to severe in 30% or more of\npatients. Vigabatrin is only available through physicians and pharmacies that participate in the REMS (risk\nevaluation and mitigation strategies) program.\n479\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 480 ---\n\nU.  Zonisamide\nZonisamide [zoe-NIS-a-mide] is a sulfonamide derivative that has a broad spectrum of action. The compound has\nmultiple effects, including blockade of both voltage-gated sodium channels and T-type calcium currents. It has a\nlimited amount of carbonic anhydrase activity. Zonisamide is approved for use in patients with focal epilepsy. It is\nmetabolized by the CYP3A4 isozyme and may, to a lesser extent, be affected by CYP3A5 and CYP2C19. In\naddition to typical CNS adverse effects, zonisamide may cause kidney stones. Oligohidrosis has been reported, and\npatients should be monitored for increased body temperature and decreased sweating. Zonisamide is contraindicated\nin patients with sulfonamide or carbonic anhydrase inhibitor hypersensitivity.\n480\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 481 ---\n\nVI.  Status Epilepticus\nIn status epilepticus, two or more seizures occur without recovery of full consciousness in between episodes. These\nmay be focal or generalized, convulsive or nonconvulsive. Status epilepticus is life threatening and requires\nemergency treatment usually consisting of parenteral administration of a fast-acting medication such as a\nbenzodiazepine, followed by a slower- acting medication such as phenytoin, fosphenytoin, divalproex, or\nlevetiracetam.\n481\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 482 ---\n\nVII.  Women’s Health and Epilepsy\nWomen of childbearing potential with epilepsy require assessment of their antiseizure medications in regard to\ncontraception and pregnancy planning. Several antiseizure medications increase the metabolism of hormonal\ncontraceptives, potentially rendering them ineffective. These include phenytoin, phenobarbital , carbamazepine,\ntopiramate, oxcarbazepine, rufinamide, and clobazam. These medications increase the metabolism of contraceptives\nregardless of the delivery system used (for example, patch, ring, implants, and oral tablets). Pregnancy planning is\nvital, as many antiseizure medications have the potential to affect fetal development and cause birth defects. All\nwomen considering pregnancy should be on high doses (1 to 5 mg) of folic acid prior to conception. Divalproex and\nbarbiturates should be avoided. If possible, women already taking divalproex should be placed on other therapies\nbefore pregnancy and counseled about the potential for birth defects, including cognitive (Figure 12.10) and\nbehavioral abnormalities and neural tube defects. The pharmacokinetics of antiseizure medications and the\nfrequency and severity of seizures may change during pregnancy. Regular monitoring by both an obstetrician and a\nneurologist is important. All women with epilepsy should be encouraged to register with the Antiepileptic Drug\nPregnancy Registry. Figure 12.11 summarizes important characteristics of the antiseizure medications.\nFigure 12.10 Cognitive function at 3 years of age after fetal exposure to doses of\nantiepileptic drugs. The means (black squares) and 95% confidence intervals (horizontal\nlines) are given for the children’s IQ as a function of the antiepileptic drugs.\n482\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 483 ---\n\nFigure 12.11 Summary of antiseizure drugs.

Over the past\nyear, the child has experienced episodes during which he develops a blank look on his face and his eyes\nblink for 15 seconds. He immediately resumes his previous activity. Which best describes seizures in this\npatient?\nA.  Focal\nB.  Tonic–clonic\nC.  Absence\nD.  Myoclonic\nCorrect answer = C. The patient is experiencing episodes of absence seizures where consciousness is impaired\nbriefly. Absence seizures generally begin in children aged 4 to 12 years. Diagnosis includes obtaining an\nelectroencephalogram that shows generalized 3-Hz waves.\nA child is experiencing absence seizures that interrupt his ability to pay attention during school and\nactivities. Which therapy is most appropriate for this patient?\nA.  Ethosuximide\nB.  Carbamazepine\nC.  Diazepam\nD.  Watchful waiting\nCorrect answer = A. The patient has had many seizures that interrupt his ability to pay attention during school and\nactivities, so therapy is justified. Carbamazepine may make the seizures more frequent. Diazepam is not indicated\nfor absence seizures.\nWhich drug is most useful for the treatment of absence seizures?\nA.  Topiramate\nB.  Tiagabine\nC.  Levetiracetam\nD.  Lamotrigine\nCorrect answer = D. Of the drugs listed, lamotrigine has the best data for use in absence seizures and is the best\nchoice. Tiagabine is only used for focal seizures. Topiramate and levetiracetam may be options if lamotrigine\ndoes not work.\nA 25-year-old woman with generalized seizures is well controlled on valproate. She indicates that she is\ninterested in becoming pregnant in the next year. With respect to her antiseizure medication, which of the\nfollowing should be considered?\nA.  Leave her on her current therapy.\nB.  Consider switching to lamotrigine.\nC.  Consider adding a second antiseizure medication.\nD.  Decrease her valproate dose.\nCorrect answer = B. Valproate is a poor choice in women of childbearing age and should be avoided if possible.\nA review of the medication history of this patient is warranted. If she has not tried any other antiseizure\nmedication, then consideration of another antiseizure medication may be beneficial. Studies show that valproate\ntaken during pregnancy can have a detrimental effect on cognitive abilities in children. However, treatment with\nvalproate may not be avoidable as it could be the only choice for some women. In these cases, the lowest\neffective dose should be used.\nA woman with generalized seizures is well controlled with lamotrigine. She becomes pregnant and begins to\nhave breakthrough seizures. What is most likely happening?\nA.  Her epilepsy is getting worse.\nB.  Lamotrigine concentrations are increasing.\nC.  Lamotrigine concentrations are decreasing.\nD.  Lamotrigine is no longer efficacious for this patient.\nCorrect answer = C. Pregnancy alters the pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine. As pregnancy progresses, women can\nrequire increased dosages to maintain blood concentrations and seizure control.\nA 42-year-old man undergoes a neurologic evaluation because of episodes of apparent confusion. Over the\npast year, the man has experienced episodes during which he develops a blank look on his face and fails to\nrespond to questions. Moreover, it appears to take several minutes before the man recovers from the\nepisodes. Which best describes this type of seizure?\nA.  Focal (aware)484\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 485 ---\n\n12.7\n12.8\n12.9\n12.10B.  Focal (impaired awareness)\nC.  Tonic–clonic\nD.  Absence\nCorrect answer = B. The patient is experiencing episodes of focal seizures with impaired consciousness.\nTypically, staring is accompanied by impaired consciousness and recall. If asked a question, the patient might\nrespond with an inappropriate or unintelligible answer. Automatic movements are associated with most focal\nseizures and involve the mouth and face (lip smacking, chewing, tasting, and swallowing movements), upper\nextremities (fumbling, picking, tapping, or clasping movements), and vocal apparatus (grunts or repetition of\nwords and phrases), as are complex acts (such as walking or mixing foods in a bowl).\nA 52-year-old man has had several focal seizures with impaired consciousness over the last year. Which is\nthe most appropriate initial therapy for this patient?\nA.  Ethosuximide\nB.  Levetiracetam\nC.  Diazepam\nD.  Carbamazepine plus primidone\nCorrect answer = B. The patient has had many seizures, and the risks of not starting drug therapy would be\nsubstantially greater than the risks of treating his seizures. Because the patient has impaired consciousness during\nthe seizure, he is at risk for injury during an attack. Monotherapy with primary agents is preferred for most\npatients. The advantages of monotherapy include reduced frequency of adverse effects, absence of interactions\nbetween antiepileptic drugs, lower cost, and improved compliance. Ethosuximide and diazepam are not indicated\nfor focal seizures.\nA patient with focal seizures has been treated for 6 months with carbamazepine but, recently, has been\nexperiencing breakthrough seizures on a more frequent basis. You are considering adding a second drug to\nthe antiseizure regimen. Which of the following drugs is least likely to have a pharmacokinetic interaction\nwith carbamazepine?\nA.  Topiramate\nB.  Tiagabine\nC.  Levetiracetam\nD.  Lamotrigine\nCorrect answer = C. Of the drugs listed, all of which are approved as adjunct therapy for refractory focal seizures,\nonly levetiracetam does not affect the pharmacokinetics of other antiepileptic drugs, and other drugs do not\nsignificantly alter its pharmacokinetics. However, any of the listed drugs could be added depending on the plan\nand the patient characteristics. Treatment of epilepsy is complex, and diagnosis is based on history and may need\nto be reevaluated when drug therapy fails or seizures increase.\nWhich is a first-line medication for generalized tonic–clonic seizures?\nA.  Ethosuximide\nB.  Felbamate\nC.  Vigabatrin\nD.  Topiramate\nCorrect answer = D. Topiramate is a broad-spectrum antiseizure medication that is indicated for primary\ngeneralized tonic–clonic seizures. Ethosuximide should only be used for absence seizures. Felbamate is reserved\nfor refractory seizures due to the risk of aplastic anemia and liver failure. Vigabatrin is not indicated for\ngeneralized seizures and is associated with visual field defects.\nA 75-year-old woman had a stroke approximately 1 month ago. She is continuing to have small focal\nseizures where she fails to respond appropriately while talking. Which is the most appropriate treatment for\nthis individual?\nA.  Phenytoin\nB.  Oxcarbazepine\nC.  Levetiracetam\nD.  Phenobarbital\nCorrect answer = C. Levetiracetam is renally cleared and prone to very few drug interactions. Elderly patients\nusually have more comorbidities and take more medications than do younger patients. Oxcarbazepine may cause\nhyponatremia, which is more symptomatic in the elderly. Phenytoin and phenobarbital have many drug\ninteractions and a side effect profile that may be especially troublesome in the elderly age group, including\ndizziness that may lead to falls, cognitive issues, and bone health issues.485\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 486 ---\n\n486\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 487 ---\n\n13\nAnesthetics\nBrandon Lopez and Chris Giordano\n487\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 488 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nFor patients undergoing surgical or medical procedures, different levels of sedation can provide important benefits\nto facilitate procedural interventions. These levels of sedation range from anxiolysis to general anesthesia and can\ncreate:\nSedation and reduced anxiety\nLack of awareness and amnesia\nSkeletal muscle relaxation\nSuppression of undesirable reflexes\nAnalgesia\nBecause no single agent provides all desired objectives, several categories of drugs are combined to produce the\noptimum level of sedation required (Figure 13.1). Drugs are chosen to provide safe and efficient sedation based on\nthe type and duration of the procedure and patient characteristics, such as organ function, medical conditions, and\nconcurrent medications (Figure 13.2). Preoperative medications provide anxiolysis and analgesia and mitigate\nunwanted side effects of the anesthetic or the procedure itself. Neuromuscular blockers enable endotracheal\nintubation and muscle relaxation to facilitate surgery. Potent general anesthetic medications are delivered via\ninhalation and/or intravenously. Except for nitrous oxide, inhaled anesthetics are volatile, halogenated hydrocarbons,\nwhile intravenous (IV) anesthetics consist of several chemically unrelated drug classes commonly used to rapidly\ninduce and/or maintain a state of general anesthesia.\n488\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 489 ---\n\n489\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 490 ---\n\nFigure 13.1 Summary of common drugs used for anesthesia. *Can cause general\nanesthesia with higher doses.

Levels of Sedation\nThe levels of sedation occur in a dose-related continuum, which is variable and depends on individual patient\nresponse to various drugs. These “artificial” levels of sedation start with light sedation (anxiolysis) and continue to\nmoderate sedation, then deep sedation, and finally a state of general anesthesia. The hallmarks of escalation from\none level to the next are recognized by changes in mentation, hemodynamic stability, and respiratory competency\n(Figure 13.3). This escalation in levels is often very subtle and unpredictable; therefore, the sedation provider must\nalways be ready to manage the unanticipated next level of sedation.\nFigure 13.3 Anesthetic levels of sedation.\n491\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 492 ---\n\nIII.  Stages of General Anesthesia\nGeneral anesthesia is a reversible state of central nervous system (CNS) depression, causing loss of response to and\nperception of stimuli. The state of general anesthesia can be divided into three stages: induction, maintenance, and\nrecovery. Induction is the time from administration of a potent anesthetic to development of unconsciousness, while\nmaintenance is the sustained period of general anesthesia. Recovery starts with the discontinuation of the anesthetic\nand continues until the return of consciousness and protective reflexes. Induction of anesthesia depends on how fast\neffective concentrations of anesthetic reach the brain. Recovery is essentially the reverse of induction and depends\non how fast the anesthetic diffuses from the brain. The depth of general anesthesia is the degree to which the CNS is\ndepressed, as evident in electroencephalograms.\n492\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 493 ---\n\nA.  Induction\nGeneral anesthesia in adults is normally induced with an IV agent like propofol , producing unconsciousness in 30 to\n40 seconds. Often, an IV neuromuscular blocker such as rocuronium, vecuronium, or succinylcholine is\nadministered to facilitate endotracheal intubation by eliciting muscle relaxation. For children without IV access,\nnonpungent volatile agents, such as sevoflurane, are administered via inhalation to induce general anesthesia.\n493\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 494 ---\n\nB.  Maintenance of anesthesia\nAfter administering the induction drug, vital signs and response to stimuli are vigilantly monitored to balance the\namount of drug continuously inhaled or infused to maintain general anesthesia. Maintenance is commonly provided\nwith volatile anesthetics, although total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with drugs like propofol  can be used to\nmaintain general anesthesia. Opioids such as fentanyl  are used for analgesia along with inhalation agents, because\nthe latter alter consciousness but not perception of pain.\n494\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 495 ---\n\nC.  Recovery\nAfter cessation of the maintenance anesthetic drug, the patient is evaluated for return of consciousness. For most\nanesthetic agents, redistribution from the site of action (rather than metabolism of the drug) underlies recovery.\nNeuromuscular blocking drugs are typically reversed after completion of surgery, unless enough time has elapsed\nfor their metabolism. The patient is monitored to assure full recovery of all normal physiologic functions\n(spontaneous respiration, blood pressure, heart rate, and all protective reflexes).\n495\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 496 ---\n\nIV.  Inhalation Anesthetics\nInhaled gases are used primarily for maintenance of anesthesia after administration of an IV drug (Figure 13.4).\nDepth of anesthesia can be rapidly altered by changing the inhaled gas concentration. Inhalational agents have steep\ndose–response curves with very narrow therapeutic indices, so the difference in concentrations from eliciting general\nanesthesia to cardiopulmonary collapse is small. No antagonists exist. To minimize waste, inhaled gases are\ndelivered in a recirculation system that contains absorbents to remove carbon dioxide and allow rebreathing of the\ngas. Recently, there has been greater attention to the anthropogenic emissions of these potent greenhouse gases,\nwhich are typically released from hospital rooftops after each procedure.\nFigure 13.4 Volatile anesthetics delivered to the patient are absorbed via the lungs into\nthe systemic circulation causing dose-dependent CNS depression.\n496\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 497 ---\n\nA.  Common features of inhalation anesthetics\nModern inhalation anesthetics are nonflammable, nonexplosive agents, which include nitrous oxide and volatile,\nhalogenated hydrocarbons. These agents decrease cerebrovascular resistance, resulting in increased brain perfusion.\nThey cause bronchodilation but also decrease both respiratory drive and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction\n(increased pulmonary vascular resistance in poorly oxygenated regions of the lungs, redirecting blood flow to better\noxygenated regions). Movement of these gases from the lungs to various body compartments depends upon their\nsolubility in blood and tissues, as well as on blood flow. The following factors play a role in induction and recovery:\n497\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 498 ---\n\nB.  Potency\nPotency is defined quantitatively as the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC), which is the end-tidal\nconcentration of inhaled anesthetic needed to eliminate movement in 50% of patients exposed to a noxious stimulus.\nMAC is the median effective dose (ED50) of the anesthetic, expressed as the percentage of gas in a mixture required\nto achieve that effect. Numerically, MAC is small for potent anesthetics such as isoflurane and large for less potent\nagents such as nitrous oxide. Thus, the inverse of MAC is an index of potency ( Figure 13.5). Nitrous oxide alone\ncannot produce general anesthesia because any admixture with a survivable oxygen percentage cannot reach its\nMAC value. The more lipid soluble an anesthetic, the lower the concentration needed to produce anesthesia and,\ntherefore, the higher the potency. Factors that can increase MAC (make the patient more resistant) include\nhyperthermia, drugs that increase CNS catecholamines, and chronic ethanol abuse. Factors that can decrease MAC\n(make the patient more sensitive) include increased age, hypothermia, pregnancy, sepsis, acute intoxication,\nconcurrent IV anesthetics, and α2-adrenergic receptor agonists (clonidine and dexmedetomidine).\nFigure 13.5 Minimal alveolar concentrations (MAC) for anesthetic gases are used to\ncompare pharmacologic effects of different agents (high MAC = low potency).\n498\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 499 ---\n\nC.  Uptake and distribution of inhalation anesthetics\nThe principal objective of inhalation anesthesia is a constant and optimal brain partial pressure (Pbr) of inhaled\nanesthetic (to create a partial pressure equilibrium between alveoli [Palv] and brain [Pbr]). Measuring the Palv is the\nmost practical and feasible way to ascertain the Pbr for the inhaled anesthetic concentration, but this necessitates\nadequate time for the two compartments to reach equilibrium. The partial pressure of an anesthetic gas that\noriginates by pulmonary entry is the driving force moving the gas from the alveolar space into the bloodstream (Pa),\nwhich transports the drug to the brain and other body compartments. Because gases move from one body\ncompartment to another according to partial pressure gradients, steady state is achieved when the partial pressure in\neach of these compartments is equivalent to that in the inspired mixture. [Note: At equilibrium, Palv = Pa = Pbr.] The\ntime course for attaining this steady state is determined by the following factors:\n1.  Alveolar wash-in\nThis refers to replacement of normal lung gases with the inspired anesthetic mixture. The time required for this\nprocess is directly proportional to the functional residual capacity of the lung (volume of gas remaining in the lungs\nat the end of a normal expiration) and inversely proportional to ventilatory rate. It is independent of the physical\nproperties of the gas. As the partial pressure builds within the lung, anesthetic gas transfer from the lung begins.\n2.  Anesthetic uptake (removal to peripheral tissues other than the brain)\nUptake is the product of the gas solubility in the blood, cardiac output (CO), and gradient between alveolar and\nblood anesthetic partial pressures.\na.  Solubility in blood\nThis is determined by a physical property of the anesthetic called the blood:gas partition coefficient (the ratio of the\nconcentration of anesthetic in the liquid [blood] phase to the concentration of anesthetic in the gas phase when the\nanesthetic is in equilibrium between the two phases; Figure 13.6). For inhaled anesthetics, think of the blood as a\npharmacologically inactive reservoir. Drugs with low versus high blood solubility differ in their rate of induction of\nanesthesia. When an anesthetic gas with low blood solubility such as nitrous oxide diffuses from the alveoli into the\ncirculation, little anesthetic dissolves in the blood. Therefore, equilibrium between the inspired anesthetic and\narterial blood occurs rapidly with relatively few additional molecules of anesthetic required to raise the arterial\nanesthetic partial pressure. By contrast, anesthetic gases with high blood solubility, such as isoflurane, dissolve more\nfully in the blood; therefore, greater amounts of gas and longer periods of time are required to raise blood partial\npressure. This results in longer periods for induction, recovery, and time to change in depth of anesthesia in response\nto changes in the drug concentration. The solubility in blood is ranked as follows: isoflurane > sevoflurane > nitrous\noxide > desflurane.\n499\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 500 ---\n\nFigure 13.6 Blood/gas partition coefficients for some inhalation anesthetics.\nb.  Cardiac output\nCO is inversely correlated with induction time for inhaled anesthetics. This counterintuitive phenomenon is\nexplained by the threshold of drug concentration required to alter neuronal activity and the time neurons are exposed\nto the drug in the passing blood. During low CO, a longer period of time permits a larger concentration of gas to\ndissolve in the slowly moving bloodstream. Furthermore, this large bolus of drug has longer contact time to diffuse\ninto neuronal tissue when it traverses the blood–brain barrier. Although a high CO will quickly transport the drug to\nthe brain, a lower concentration of the drug with a shorter exposure time slows down the rate of induction.\nc.  Alveolar-to-venous partial pressure gradient\nThis gradient between the alveolar and returning venous gas partial pressure results from the tissue uptake from the\narterial delivery. The arterial circulation distributes the anesthetic to various tissues, and tissue uptake is dependent\non the tissue blood flow, blood-to-tissue partial pressure difference, and blood-to-tissue solubility coefficient. As\nvenous circulation returns to the lung blood with low or no dissolved anesthetic gas, this high gradient causes gas to\nmove from the alveoli into the blood. If a large alveolar-to-venous partial pressure gradient persists, the peripheral\ntissue gas uptake must be high, and therefore, the induction time is longer. Over time, as the partial pressure of gas\nin venous blood approximates the inspired mixture and subsequent alveolar concentration, no further uptake from\nthe lung occurs.\n3.  Effect of different tissue types on anesthetic uptake\nThe time required for a tissue compartment to reach steady state with the partial pressure of the inspired anesthetic\ngas is inversely proportional to the blood flow to that tissue (greater flow equals less time to reach equilibrium).\nTime to steady state is directly proportional to the capacity of that tissue to store anesthetic (greater storage capacity\nequals longer time to reach equilibrium). Furthermore, capacity is directly proportional to the volume of tissue and\nthe tissue:blood solubility coefficient of the gas. Four major tissue compartments determine the time course of\nanesthetic uptake:\na.  Vessel-rich group (brain, heart, liver, kidney, and endocrine glands)\nHighly perfused tissues rapidly attain steady state with the partial pressure of anesthetic in the blood.\nb.  Skeletal muscles500\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 501 ---\n\nThese tissues are moderately perfused with a large storage capacity, which lengthens the time required to achieve\nsteady state.\nc.  Fat\nFat is poorly perfused but has a very large storage capacity for the highly lipophilic volatile anesthetics. This poor\nperfusion to a high-capacity compartment drastically prolongs the time required to achieve steady state.\nd.  Vessel-poor group (bone, ligaments, and cartilage)\nThese are very poorly perfused and have a low capacity to store anesthetic gas. Therefore, these tissues have\nminimal impact on the time course of anesthetic distribution in the body.\n4.  Washout\nWhen an inhalation anesthetic gas is removed from the inspired admixture, the body becomes the repository of\nanesthetic gas to be circulated back to the alveolar compartment. The same factors that influence uptake and\nequilibrium of the inspired anesthetic determine the time course of its exhalation from the body.

The fact that chemically\nunrelated compounds produce unconsciousness argues against the existence of a single receptor, and it appears that a\nvariety of molecular mechanisms may contribute to the activity of anesthetics. At clinically effective concentrations,\ngeneral anesthetics increase the sensitivity of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors to the inhibitory\nneurotransmitter GABA. This increases chloride ion influx and hyperpolarization of neurons. Postsynaptic neuronal\nexcitability and, thus, CNS activity are diminished (Figure 13.8). Unlike other anesthetics, nitrous oxide and\nketamine do not have actions on GABAA receptors. Their effects are mediated via inhibition of N -methyl-D-aspartate\n(NMDA) receptors. [Note: The NMDA receptor is a glutamate receptor, which is the body’s main excitatory\nneurotransmitter.] Receptors other than GABA that are affected by volatile anesthetics include the inhibitory glycine\nreceptors found in the spinal motor neurons. Additionally, inhalation anesthetics block excitatory postsynaptic\ncurrents found on nicotinic receptors. However, the mechanisms by which anesthetics perform these modulatory\nroles are not fully understood.\n504\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 505 ---\n\n505\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 506 ---\n\nFigure 13.8 An example of modulation of a ligand-gated membrane channel modulated\nby inhaled anesthetics.

Desflurane\nDesflurane [DES-floor-ane] provides very rapid onset and recovery due to low blood solubility. This makes it a\npopular anesthetic for short procedures. It has a low volatility, which requires administration via a special heated\nvaporizer. Like isoflurane, it decreases vascular resistance and perfuses all major tissues very well. Desflurane has\nsignificant respiratory irritation like isoflurane so it should not be used for inhalation induction. Its degradation is\nminimal and tissue toxicity is rare. Higher cost occasionally prohibits its use.\n508\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 509 ---\n\nG.  Sevoflurane\nSevoflurane [see-voe-FLOOR-ane] has low pungency or respiratory irritation. This makes it useful for inhalation\ninduction, especially with pediatric patients who do not tolerate IV placement. It has a rapid onset and recovery due\nto low blood solubility. Sevoflurane has low hepatotoxic potential, but compounds formed from reactions in the\nanesthesia circuit (soda lime) may be nephrotoxic with very low fresh gas flow that allows longer chemical reaction\ntime.\n509\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 510 ---\n\nH.  Nitrous oxide\nNitrous oxide [NYE-truss OX-ide] (“laughing gas”) is a nonirritating potent sedative that is unable to create a state\nof general anesthesia. It is frequently used at concentrations of 30% to 50% in combination with oxygen to create\nmoderate sedation, particularly in dentistry. Nitrous oxide does not depress respiration, and maintains cardiovascular\nhemodynamics as well as muscular strength. Nitrous oxide can be combined with other inhalational agents to\nestablish general anesthesia, which lowers the required concentration of the combined volatile agent. This gas\nadmixture further reduces many unwanted side effects of the other volatile agent that impact cardiovascular output\nand cerebral blood flow. Nitrous oxide is poorly soluble in blood and other tissues, allowing it to move very rapidly\nin and out of the body. This can be problematic in closed body compartments because nitrous oxide can increase the\nvolume (exacerbating a pneumothorax) or pressure (sinus or middle ear pressure); it replaces nitrogen in various air\nspaces faster than the nitrogen leaves. Its speed of movement allows nitrous oxide to retard oxygen uptake during\nrecovery, thereby causing “diffusion hypoxia.” This can be overcome by delivering high concentrations of inspired\noxygen during recovery. Some characteristics of the inhalation anesthetics are summarized in Figure 13.9.\n510\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 511 ---\n\nFigure 13.9 Characteristics of some inhalation anesthetics.\n511\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 512 ---\n\nI.  Malignant hyperthermia\nIn a very small percentage of susceptible patients, exposure to halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics (or\nsuccinylcholine) may induce malignant hyperthermia (MH), a rare life-threatening condition. MH causes a drastic\nand uncontrolled increase in skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism, overwhelming the body’s capacity to supply\noxygen, remove carbon dioxide, and regulate temperature, eventually leading to circulatory collapse and death if not\ntreated immediately. Strong evidence indicates that MH is due to an excitation–contraction coupling defect. Burn\nvictims and individuals with muscular dystrophy, myopathy, myotonia, and osteogenesis imperfecta are susceptible\nto MH-like events and caution should be taken. Susceptibility to MH is often inherited as an autosomal dominant\ndisorder. Should a patient exhibit symptoms of MH, dantrolene is given as the anesthetic mixture is withdrawn, and\nmeasures are taken to rapidly cool the patient. Dantrolene [DAN-troe-leen] blocks release of Ca2+ from the\nsarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle cells, reducing heat production and relaxing muscle tone. It should be available\nwhenever triggering agents are administered. In addition, the patient must be monitored and supported for\nrespiratory, circulatory, and renal problems. Use of dantrolene and avoidance of triggering agents such as\nhalogenated anesthetics in susceptible individuals have markedly reduced mortality from MH. A more soluble\nformulation of dantrolene has become commercially available that drastically reduces the constitution time needed\nto make this drug in emergencies.\n512\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 513 ---\n\nV.  Intravenous Anesthetics\nIV anesthetics cause rapid induction of anesthesia often occurring in 1 minute or less. It is the most common way to\ninduce anesthesia before maintenance of anesthesia with an inhalation agent. IV anesthetics may be used as single\nagents for short procedures or administered as infusions (TIVA) to help maintain anesthesia during longer surgeries.\nIn lower doses, they may be used solely for sedation.\n513\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 514 ---\n\nA.  Induction\nAfter entering the blood, a percentage of drug binds to plasma proteins, and the rest remains unbound or “free.” The\ndegree of protein binding depends upon the physical characteristics of the drug, such as the degree of ionization and\nlipid solubility. The majority of CO flows to the brain, liver, and kidney (“vessel-rich organs”). Thus, a high\nproportion of initial drug bolus is delivered to the cerebral circulation and then passes along a concentration gradient\nfrom blood into the brain. The rate of this transfer is dependent on the arterial concentration of the unbound free\ndrug, the lipid solubility of the drug, and the degree of ionization. Unbound, lipid-soluble, nonionized molecules\ncross into the brain most quickly. Like inhalational anesthetics, the exact mode of action of IV anesthetics is\nunknown; however, GABA likely plays a large role.\n514\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 515 ---\n\nB.  Recovery\nRecovery from IV anesthetics is due to redistribution from the CNS. After initial flooding of the CNS and other\nvessel-rich tissues with nonionized molecules, the drug diffuses into other tissues with less blood supply. With\nsecondary tissue uptake, predominantly skeletal muscle, plasma concentration of the drug falls. This allows the drug\nto diffuse out of the CNS, down the resulting reverse concentration gradient. This initial redistribution of drug into\nother tissues leads to the rapid recovery seen after a single IV dose of induction agent. Metabolism and plasma\nclearance become important only following infusions and repeat doses of a drug. Adipose tissue makes little\ncontribution to the early redistribution of free drug following a bolus, due to its poor blood supply. However,\nfollowing repeat doses or infusions, equilibration with fat tissue forms a drug reservoir, often leading to delayed\nrecovery.\n515\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 516 ---\n\nC.  Effect of reduced cardiac output on IV anesthetics\nWhen CO is reduced (for example, in certain types of shock, the elderly, cardiac disease), the body compensates by\ndiverting more CO to the cerebral circulation. A greater proportion of the IV anesthetic enters the cerebral\ncirculation under these circumstances. Therefore, the dose of the drug must be reduced. Further, decreased CO\ncauses prolonged circulation time. As global CO is reduced, it takes a longer time for an induction drug to reach the\nbrain and exert its effects. The slow titration of a reduced dose of an IV anesthetic is key to a safe induction in\npatients with reduced CO.\n516\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 517 ---\n\nD.  Propofol\nPropofol  [PRO-puh-fol] is an IV sedative/hypnotic used for induction and/or maintenance of anesthesia. It is widely\nused and has replaced thiopental  as the first choice for induction of general anesthesia and sedation. Because\npropofol  is poorly water soluble, it is supplied as an emulsion containing soybean oil and egg phospholipid, giving it\na milklike appearance.\n1.  Onset\nInduction is smooth and occurs 30 to 40 seconds after administration. Plasma levels decline rapidly as a result of\nredistribution, followed by a more prolonged period of hepatic metabolism and renal clearance. The initial\nredistribution half-life is 2 to 4 minutes. The pharmacokinetics of propofol  are not altered by moderate hepatic or\nrenal failure.\n2.  Actions\nAlthough propofol  depresses the CNS, it occasionally contributes to excitatory phenomena, such as muscle\ntwitching, spontaneous movement, yawning, and hiccups. Transient pain at the injection site is common. Propofol\ndecreases blood pressure without significantly depressing the myocardium. It also reduces intracranial pressure,\nmainly due to decreased cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption. It has less of a depressant effect than volatile\nanesthetics on CNS-evoked potentials, making it useful for surgeries in which spinal cord function is monitored. It\ndoes not provide analgesia, so supplementation with narcotics is required. Propofol  is commonly infused in lower\ndoses to provide sedation. The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is very low secondary to its\nantiemetic properties.\n517\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 518 ---\n\nE.  Barbiturates\nThiopental  [THYE-oh-PEN-tahl] is an ultra–short-acting barbiturate with high lipid solubility. It is a potent\nanesthetic but a weak analgesic. Barbiturates require supplementary analgesic administration during anesthesia.\nWhen given IV, agents such as thiopental  and methohexital  [meth-oh-HEX-uh-tall] quickly enter the CNS and\ndepress function, often in less than 1 minute. However, diffusion out of the brain can also occur very rapidly\nbecause of redistribution to other tissues (Figure 13.10). These drugs may remain in the body for relatively long\nperiods, because only about 15% of a dose entering the circulation is metabolized by the liver per hour. Thus,\nmetabolism of thiopental  is much slower than its redistribution. Barbiturates tend to decrease blood pressure, which\nmay cause a reflex tachycardia. They decrease intracranial pressure through reductions in cerebral blood flow and\noxygen consumption. Thiopental  is no longer available in many countries, including the United States. Methohexital\nis still commonly used for electroconvulsive therapy.\nFigure 13.10 Redistribution of thiopental from the brain to muscle and adipose tissue.\n518\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 519 ---\n\nF.  Benzodiazepines\nThe benzodiazepines are used in conjunction with anesthetics for sedation and amnesia. The most commonly used is\nmidazolam [meh-DAZ-o-lam]. Diazepam [dye-AZ-uh-pam] and lorazepam [lore-AZ-uh-pam] are alternatives. All\nthree facilitate amnesia while causing sedation, enhancing the inhibitory effects of various neurotransmitters,\nparticularly GABA. Minimal cardiovascular depressant effects are seen, but all are potential respiratory depressants\n(especially when administered IV). They are metabolized by the liver with variable elimination half-lives, and\nerythromycin may prolong effects of midazolam. Benzodiazepines can induce a temporary form of anterograde\namnesia in which the patient retains memory of past events, but new information is not transferred into long-term\nmemory. Therefore, important treatment information should be repeated to the patient after the effects of the drug\nhave worn off.\n519\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 520 ---\n\nG.  Opioids\nBecause of their analgesic property, opioids are commonly combined with other anesthetics. The choice of opioid is\nbased primarily on the duration of action needed. The most commonly used opioids are fentanyl  [FEN-ta-nil] and its\ncongeners, sufentanil  [SOO-fen-ta-nil] and remifentanil  [REMI-fen-ta-nil], because they induce analgesia more\nrapidly than morphine. They may be administered intravenously, epidurally, or intrathecally (into the cerebrospinal\nfluid). Opioids are not good amnestics, and they can all cause hypotension and respiratory depression, as well as\nnausea and vomiting. Opioid effects can be antagonized by naloxone.\n520\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 521 ---\n\nH.  Etomidate\nEtomidate [ee-TOM-uh-date] is a hypnotic agent used to induce anesthesia, but it lacks analgesic activity. Its water\nsolubility is poor, so it is formulated in a propylene glycol solution. Induction is rapid, and the drug is short-acting.\nAmong its benefits are little to no effect on the heart and systemic vascular resistance. Etomidate is usually only\nused for patients with cardiovascular dysfunction or patients who are acutely critically ill. It inhibits 11-β\nhydroxylase involved in steroidogenesis, and adverse effects may include decreased plasma cortisol and aldosterone\nlevels. Etomidate should not be infused for an extended time, because prolonged suppression of these hormones is\ndangerous. Injection site pain, involuntary skeletal muscle movements, and nausea and vomiting are common.\n521\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 522 ---\n\nI.  Ketamine\nKetamine [KET-uh-meen], a short-acting anti-NMDA receptor anesthetic and analgesic, induces a dissociated state\nin which the patient is unconscious (but may appear to be awake) with profound analgesia. Ketamine stimulates\ncentral sympathetic outflow, causing stimulation of the heart with increased blood pressure and CO. It is also a\npotent bronchodilator. Therefore, it is beneficial in patients with hypovolemic or cardiogenic shock as well as\nasthmatics. Conversely, it is contraindicated in hypertensive or stroke patients. The drug is lipophilic and enters the\nbrain very quickly. Like the barbiturates, it redistributes to other organs and tissues. Ketamine has become popular\nas an adjunct to reduce opioid consumption during surgery. Of note, it may induce hallucinations, particularly in\nyoung adults, but pretreatment with benzodiazepines may help. Ketamine may be used illicitly, since it causes a\ndreamlike state and hallucinations similar to phencyclidine (PCP).\n522\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 523 ---\n\nJ.  Dexmedetomidine\nDexmedetomidine [dex-med-eh-TOM-uh-deen] is a sedative used in intensive care settings and surgery. Like\nclonidine, it is an α2 receptor agonist in certain parts of the brain. Dexmedetomidine has sedative, analgesic,\nsympatholytic, and anxiolytic effects that blunt many cardiovascular responses. It reduces volatile anesthetic,\nsedative, and analgesic requirements without causing significant respiratory depression. It has gained popularity for\nits ability to blunt emergence delirium in the pediatric population. Some therapeutic advantages and disadvantages\nof the anesthetic agents are summarized in Figure 13.11.\nFigure 13.11 Therapeutic disadvantages and advantages of some anesthetic agents.\n523\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 524 ---\n\nVI.  Neuromuscular Blockers\nNeuromuscular blockers are crucial to the practice of anesthesia and used to facilitate endotracheal intubation and\nprovide muscle relaxation when needed for surgery. Their mechanism of action is via blockade of nicotinic\nacetylcholine receptors on the skeletal muscle cell membrane. These agents include cisatracurium, mivacurium,\npancuronium, rocuronium, succinylcholine, and vecuronium (see",

Sugammadex\nSugammadex [soo-GAM-ma-dex] is a selective relaxant-binding agent that terminates the action of both rocuronium\nand vecuronium. Its three-dimensional structure traps the neuromuscular blocker in a 1:1 ratio, terminating its action\nand making it water soluble. It is unique in that it produces rapid and effective reversal of both shallow and profound\nneuromuscular blockade. Sugammadex is eliminated via the kidneys.\n525\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 526 ---\n\nVII.  Local Anesthetics\nLocal anesthetics block nerve conduction of sensory impulses and in higher concentrations block motor impulses\nfrom the periphery to the CNS. Sodium ion channels are blocked to prevent the transient increase in permeability of\nthe nerve membrane to Na+ that is required for an action potential (Figure 13.12). When propagation of action\npotentials is prevented, sensation cannot be transmitted from the source of stimulation to the brain. Delivery\ntechniques include topical administration, infiltration, and perineural and neuraxial (spinal, epidural, or caudal)\nblocks. Small, unmyelinated nerve fibers for pain, temperature, and autonomic activity are most sensitive.\nStructurally, local anesthetics all include a lipophilic group joined by an amide or ester linkage to a carbon chain,\nwhich, in turn, is joined to a hydrophilic group (Figure 13.13). The most widely used local anesthetics are\nbupivacaine [byoo-PIV-uh-cane], lidocaine [LYE-doe-cane], mepivacaine [muh-PIV-uh-cane], ropivacaine [roe-\nPIV-uh-cane], and tetracaine [TET-truh-cane].\nFigure 13.12 Mechanism of local anesthetic action.\nFigure 13.13 Representative structures of ester and amide anesthetics.\n526\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 527 ---\n\n527\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 528 ---\n\nA.  Actions\nLocal anesthetics cause vasodilation, which leads to a rapid diffusion away from the site of action and short duration\nwhen these drugs are administered alone. By adding the vasoconstrictor epinephrine, the rate of local anesthetic\nabsorption and diffusion is decreased. This minimizes systemic toxicity and increases the duration of action. Hepatic\nfunction does not affect the duration of action of local anesthesia because that is determined by redistribution rather\nthan biotransformation. Some local anesthetics have other therapeutic uses (for example, lidocaine is an IV\nantiarrhythmic).\n528\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 529 ---\n\nB.  Onset, potency, and duration of action\nThe onset of action of local anesthetics is influenced by several factors including tissue pH, nerve morphology,\nconcentration, pKa, and lipid solubility of the drug. Of these, the pKa is most important. Local anesthetics with a\nlower pKa have a quicker onset, since more drug exists in the unionized form at physiologic pH, thereby allowing\npenetration of the nerve cell membrane. Once at the nerve membrane, the ionized form interacts with the protein\nreceptor of the Na+ channel to inhibit its function and achieve local anesthesia. The pH may drop in infected sites,\ncausing onset to be delayed or even prevented. Potency and duration of these agents depend mainly on lipid\nsolubility, with higher solubility correlating with increased potency and duration of action.\n529\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 530 ---\n\nC.  Metabolism\nBiotransformation of amides occurs primarily in the liver. Prilocaine [PRY-low-cane], a dental anesthetic, is also\nmetabolized in the plasma and kidney, and one of its metabolites may lead to methemoglobinemia. Esters are\nbiotransformed by plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase). Patients with pseudocholinesterase deficiency may\nmetabolize ester local anesthetics more slowly. At normal doses, this has little clinical effect. Reduced hepatic\nfunction predisposes patients to toxic effects, but should not significantly increase the duration of action of local\nanesthetics.\n530\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 531 ---\n\nD.  Allergic reactions\nPatient reports of allergic reactions to local anesthetics are fairly common, but often times, reported “allergies” are\nactually side effects from the coadministered epinephrine. True allergy to an amide local anesthetic is exceedingly\nrare, while the ester procaine is more allergenic and has largely been removed from the market. Allergy to one ester\nrules out use of another ester, because the allergenic component is the metabolite para-aminobenzoic acid, produced\nby all esters. By contrast, allergy to one amide does not rule out the use of another amide. A patient may be allergic\nto other compounds in the local anesthetic, such as preservatives in multidose vials.\n531\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 532 ---\n\nE.  Local anesthetic systemic toxicity\nToxic blood levels of a local anesthetic may be due to repeated injections or could result from a single inadvertent\nIV injection. Each drug has a weight-based toxic threshold that should be calculated. This is especially important in\nchildren, the elderly, and women in labor (who are more susceptible to local anesthetics). Aspiration before every\ninjection is imperative. The signs, symptoms, and timing of local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) are\nunpredictable. One must consider the diagnosis in any patient with altered mental status, seizures, or cardiovascular\ninstability following injection of local anesthetic. Treatment for LAST may include seizure suppression, airway\nmanagement, and cardiopulmonary support. Administering a 20% lipid emulsion infusion (lipid rescue therapy) is a\nvaluable asset. Figure 13.14 summarizes pharmacologic properties of some local anesthetics.\nFigure 13.14 Summary of pharmacologic properties of some local anesthetics.

Analogs of GABA (gabapentin, pregabalin; see Chapter\n12) are becoming more common as pretreatment to reduce opioid consumption both during and after surgery. They\nalso have multiple uses in neuropathic pain and addiction medicine. The NMDA antagonist ketamine is used to\nreduce overall opioid consumption both intra- and postoperatively. Actions of anesthesia adjunct drugs are shown in\nFigure 13.15.\n537\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 538 ---\n\n538\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 539 ---\n\nFigure 13.15 Actions of anesthesia adjunct drugs.\n539\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 540 ---\n\n13.1\n13.2\n13.3\n13.4\n13.5\n13.6\n13.7Study Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nRegarding levels of sedation, which one applies to loss of perception and sensation to painful stimuli?\nA.  Anxiolysis\nB.  General anesthesia\nC.  Moderate sedation\nD.  Deep sedation\nCorrect answer = B. Anxiolysis is a state of relaxation, but consciousness remains. General anesthesia is a total\nloss of perception and sensation to stimuli. Moderate sedation maintains mentation with adequate airway and\nrespiratory competency. Deep sedation has some response to stimuli, but respirations may be inadequate.\nWhich of the following decreases minimum alveolar concentration (MAC)?\nA.  Hyperthermia\nB.  Cocaine intoxication\nC.  Pregnancy\nD.  Chronic ethanol abuse\nCorrect answer = C. Pregnancy is the only choice that decreases minimum alveolar concentration. All the other\noptions increase MAC.\nWhich of the following determines the speed of recovery from intravenous anesthetics used for induction?\nA.  Liver metabolism of the drug\nB.  Protein binding of the drug\nC.  Ionization of the drug\nD.  Redistribution of the drug from sites in the CNS\nCorrect answer = D. Following initial flooding of the CNS with nonionized molecules, the drug diffuses into\nother tissues. With secondary tissue uptake, the plasma concentration falls, allowing the drug to diffuse out of the\nCNS. This initial redistribution of drug into other tissues leads to the rapid recovery seen after a single dose of an\nIV induction drug. Protein binding, ionization, and lipid solubility affect the rate of transfer.\nWhich one of the following is a potent intravenous anesthetic and analgesic?\nA.  Propofol\nB.  Midazolam\nC.  Ketamine\nD.  Fentanyl\nCorrect answer = C. Ketamine is unique in its blockage of NMDA receptors, yielding both potent anesthetic and\nanalgesic properties. Propofol is a potent anesthetic but a weak analgesic. Benzodiazepines such as midazolam\nhave little analgesic effect, but can be a potent anesthetic at high doses. Fentanyl is a potent analgesic.\nWhich local anesthetic is metabolized by plasma cholinesterase?\nA.  Tetracaine\nB.  Bupivacaine\nC.  Lidocaine\nD.  Ropivacaine\nCorrect answer = A. Tetracaine is the only ester type local anesthetic of the choices. The other choices are amide-\ntype local anesthetics, which are metabolized by biotransformation in the liver. Remember that esters usually\nhave one “i” in the spelling, where amides typically have two “i”’s.\nA 23-year-old patient with a history of severe postoperative nausea and vomiting is coming in for plastic\nsurgery. Which anesthetic drug would be best to use for maintenance in this situation?\nA.  Isoflurane\nB.  Sevoflurane\nC.  Nitrous oxide\nD.  Propofol\nCorrect answer = D. A propofol infusion (TIVA) anesthetic would be best for this patient with a history of\npostoperative nausea and vomiting. Propofol is the only anesthetic listed with antiemetic properties. Both\nfluorinated hydrocarbons (isoflurane and sevoflurane) and nitrous oxide are linked to nausea and vomiting during\nsurgery.\nA 61-year-old patient with an acute myocardial infarction has severely reduced cardiac output. He has to540\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 541 ---\n\n13.8\n13.9\n13.10undergo emergent coronary artery bypass surgery. Which of the following would you expect in this patient?\nA.  Faster induction time with IV anesthetics\nB.  Need for increased dosage of IV anesthetics\nC.  Faster induction time with inhaled anesthetics\nD.  Enhanced removal of inhaled anesthetics to peripheral tissues\nCorrect answer = C. For inhaled anesthetics during low CO, a longer period of time permits a larger concentration\nof gas to dissolve in the slowly moving bloodstream. Furthermore, this large bolus of drug has longer contact time\nto diffuse into neuronal tissue when it traverses the blood–brain barrier, yielding a faster induction time. The dose\nof an IV drug must be reduced (not increased). In addition, with reduced cardiac output, it takes a longer time for\nan IV induction drug to reach the brain, resulting in a slower induction time.\nA 70-year-old patient in the intensive care unit needs sedation due to prolonged endotracheal intubation.\nWhich of the following medications should be avoided for sedation in this patient?\nA.  Fentanyl\nB.  Etomidate\nC.  Propofol\nD.  Dexmedetomidine\nCorrect answer = B. Adverse effects of etomidate include decreased plasma cortisol and aldosterone levels by\ninhibiting the 11-β hydroxylase enzyme. Etomidate should not be infused for an extended time, because\nprolonged suppression of these hormones is dangerous. All of the other choices could be used for sedation in the\nICU setting.\nA 35-year-old man presents with appendicitis and requires a surgical intervention. He has a family history of\nmalignant hyperthermia. Which anesthetic agent is most appropriate to use in this patient?\nA.  Isoflurane\nB.  Propofol\nC.  Succinylcholine\nD.  Sevoflurane\nCorrect answer = B. Propofol is the only medication listed that is safe in patients susceptible to malignant\nhyperthermia. All fluorinated hydrocarbons (isoflurane, sevoflurane, desflurane) as well as succinylcholine are\ncontraindicated and considered triggering agents. Flushing of the anesthesia machine, removal of vaporizers, use\nof special filters, and availability of dantrolene are highly advised.\nA 32-year-old woman presents for a right distal radius fracture. She requests regional anesthesia to help with\nher pain postoperatively. She reports that as a child, she had an allergic reaction to Novocain (procaine) at\nthe dentist’s office. Which local anesthetic is appropriate for use in this patient?\nA.  Chloroprocaine\nB.  Benzocaine\nC.  Ropivacaine\nD.  Tetracaine\nCorrect answer = C. Procaine is an ester local anesthetic. Since this patient has an allergy to procaine, other ester\nanesthetics (chloroprocaine, tetracaine, benzocaine) should not be used. Benzocaine is mostly used as a topical\nproduct for temporary relief of dental or oral pain. Ropivacaine is an amide local anesthetic commonly used in\nregional anesthesia to facilitate peripheral nerve blockade.541\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 542 ---\n\n14\nOpioids\nRobin Moorman Li\n542\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 543 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nManagement of pain is one of clinical medicine’s greatest challenges. Pain is defined as an unpleasant sensation that\ncan be either acute or chronic and is a consequence of complex neurochemical processes in the peripheral and\ncentral nervous systems (CNS). It is subjective, and the clinician must rely on the patient’s perception and\ndescription of pain. Alleviation of pain depends on the specific type of pain (nociceptive or neuropathic pain). For\nexample, with mild to moderate arthritic pain (nociceptive pain), nonopioid analgesics such as nonsteroidal anti-\ninflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; see",

        "content": "Chapter 38) are often effective. Neuropathic pain responds best to\nanticonvulsants, tricyclic antidepressants, or serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. However, for severe acute\npain or chronic malignant or nonmalignant pain, opioids can be considered as part of the treatment plan in select\npatients (Figure 14.1). Opioids are natural, semisynthetic, or synthetic compounds that produce morphine-like\neffects (Figure 14.2). These agents are divided into chemical classes based on their chemical structure (Figure 14.3).\nAll opioids act by binding to specific opioid receptors in the CNS to produce effects that mimic the action of\nendogenous peptide neurotransmitters (for example, endorphins, enkephalins, and dynorphins). Although the opioids\nhave a broad range of effects, their primary use is to relieve intense pain that results from surgery, injury, or chronic\ndisease. Unfortunately, widespread availability of opioids has led to abuse of agents with euphoric properties.\nAntagonists that reverse the actions of opioids are also clinically important for use in cases of overdose (Figure\n14.1).\n543\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 544 ---\n\nFigure 14.1 Summary of opioid analgesics and antagonists with common trade names. *\n= Contains acetaminophen.\n544\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 545 ---\n\nFigure 14.2 Origin of opioids: natural, semisynthetic, or synthetic.\n545\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 546 ---\n\n546\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 547 ---\n\nFigure 14.3 Pharmacological classes of opioids and actions on opioid receptors.\n547\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 548 ---\n\nII.  Opioid Receptors\nThe major effects of the opioids are mediated by three main receptor families, commonly designated as μ (mu,\nMOR), κ (kappa, KOR), and δ (delta, DOR). Each receptor family exhibits a different specificity for the drug(s) it\nbinds. The analgesic properties of the opioids are primarily mediated by the mu receptors that modulate responses to\nthermal, mechanical, and chemical nociception. The κ receptors in the dorsal horn also contribute to analgesia by\nmodulating the response to chemical and thermal nociception. The enkephalins interact more selectively with δ\nreceptors in the periphery. All three opioid receptors are members of the G protein–coupled receptor family and\ninhibit adenylyl cyclase. They are also associated with ion channels, increasing postsynaptic K+ efflux\n(hyperpolarization) or reducing presynaptic Ca2+ influx, thus impeding neuronal firing and transmitter release in the\nspinal dorsal horn (Figure 14.4).\n548\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 549 ---\n\n549\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 550 ---\n\nFigure 14.4 Mechanism of action of μ opioid receptor agonists in the spinal cord.\n550\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 551 ---\n\nIII.  Opioid Agonists\nMorphine [MOR-feen] is the prototypical strong μ receptor agonist. Codeine [KOE-deen] is inherently less potent\nand the prototype of the weak μ opioid agonists. Currently available opioids have many differences, such as receptor\naffinity, pharmacokinetic profiles, available routes of administration, and adverse effect profiles. Some opioids are\nalso available in abuse deterrent formulations. Comparing other available opioids to morphine is helpful in\nidentifying the unique differences to guide the selection of a safe and effective pain management regimen (Figure\n14.5).\nFigure 14.5 Summary of clinically relevant properties for selected opioids.\n551\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 552 ---\n\nA.  Morphine\n1.  Mechanism of action\nMorphine and other opioids exert analgesic effects by interacting stereospecifically with opioid receptors on the\nmembranes of neuronal cells in the CNS and other anatomic structures, such as the smooth muscles of the\ngastrointestinal (GI) tract and the urinary bladder. Morphine is somewhat selective to the μ opioid receptor but has\nsome affinity for the κ and δ receptors. Morphine also inhibits the release of many excitatory transmitters from nerve\nterminals carrying nociceptive (painful) stimuli. Some therapeutic uses of morphine and other opioids are listed in\nFigure 14.6.\nFigure 14.6 Selected clinical uses of opioids.\n2.  Actions\na.  Analgesia\nMorphine and other opioids relieve pain by raising the pain threshold at the spinal cord level and by altering the\nbrain’s perception of pain. The maximum analgesic efficacy for representative opioid agonists is shown in Figure\n14.7.\n552\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 553 ---\n\nFigure 14.7 A comparison of opioid agonist efficacy.\nb.  Euphoria\nMorphine produces a powerful sense of contentment and well-being. Euphoria may be caused by disinhibition of the\ndopamine-containing neurons of the ventral tegmental area.\nc.  Respiration\nMorphine causes respiratory depression by reduction of the responsiveness of medullary respiratory center neurons\nto carbon dioxide. This can occur with ordinary doses of morphine in patients who are opioid naïve and can be\naccentuated as the dose is increased, until ultimately respiration ceases. Respiratory depression is the most common\ncause of death in acute opioid overdoses. Tolerance to this effect develops with repeated dosing, which allows for\nthe safer use of morphine for the treatment of pain when the dose is correctly titrated.\nd.  Depression of cough reflex\nBoth morphine and codeine have antitussive properties. In general, cough suppression does not correlate closely\nwith analgesic and respiratory depressant properties of opioid drugs. The receptors involved in the antitussive action\nappear to be different from those involved in analgesia.\ne.  Miosis\nThe pinpoint pupil (Figure 14.8) characteristic of morphine use results from stimulation of μ and κ receptors. There\nis little tolerance to this effect. [Note: This is important diagnostically, because many other causes of coma and\nrespiratory depression produce dilation of the pupil.]\n553\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 554 ---\n\nFigure 14.8 Characteristic pinpoint pupil associated with morphine use.\nf.  Emesis\nMorphine directly stimulates the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the area postrema that causes vomiting.\ng.  GI tract\nMorphine relieves diarrhea by decreasing the motility and increasing the tone of the intestinal circular smooth\nmuscle. Morphine also increases the tone of the anal sphincter. Morphine and other opioids produce constipation,\nwith little tolerance developing. Morphine can also increase biliary tract pressure due to contraction of the\ngallbladder and constriction of the biliary sphincter.\nh.  Cardiovascular\nMorphine has no major effects on blood pressure or heart rate at lower dosages, but hypotension and bradycardia\nmay occur at higher doses. Because of respiratory depression and carbon dioxide retention, cerebral vessels dilate\nand increase cerebrospinal fluid pressure. Morphine is usually contraindicated in individuals with head trauma or\nsevere brain injury.\ni.  Histamine release\nMorphine releases histamine from mast cells causing urticaria, sweating, and vasodilation. Because it can cause\nbronchoconstriction, morphine should be used with caution in patients with asthma.\nj.  Hormonal actions\nProlonged use of morphine may lead to opioid-induced androgen deficiency due to suppression of the\nhypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPA). This results in decreased production of sex hormones, especially\ntestosterone, resulting in many clinical symptoms (Figure 14.9).\n554\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 555 ---\n\n555\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 556 ---\n\nFigure 14.9 Clinical symptoms associated with opioid-induced androgen deficiency\n(OPIAD).\nk.  Labor\nMorphine may prolong the second stage of labor by transiently decreasing the strength, duration, and frequency of\nuterine contractions.\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\na.  Administration\nMorphine has a linear pharmacokinetic profile; however, absorption of morphine after oral administration is slow\nand erratic. Extended-release oral preparations provide more consistent plasma levels. Because significant first-pass\nmetabolism of morphine occurs in the liver, subcutaneous and intravenous (IV) injections produce the most reliable\nresponse.\nb.  Distribution\nMorphine rapidly enters all body tissues, including the fetuses of pregnant women. It should not be used for\nanalgesia during labor. Infants born to addicted mothers show physical dependence on opioids and exhibit\nwithdrawal symptoms if opioids are not administered. Only a small percentage of morphine crosses the blood–brain\nbarrier, because morphine is the least lipophilic of the common opioids. By contrast, the more lipid-soluble opioids,\nsuch as fentanyl  and methadone, readily penetrate the CNS.\nc.  Fate\nMorphine is conjugated with glucuronic acid in the liver to two active metabolites (morphine-6-glucuronide [M6G]\nand morphine-3-glucuronide [M3G]), which are renally excreted. M6G is a very potent analgesic. M3G does not\nhave analgesic activity but is believed to cause neuroexcitatory effects. The duration of action of morphine is 4 to 5\nhours when administered systemically to opioid-naïve individuals but considerably longer when injected epidurally\nbecause the low lipophilicity prevents redistribution from the epidural space.\n4.  Adverse effects\nMany adverse effects are common across the entire opioid class (Figure 14.10). With most mu agonists, severe\nrespiratory depression can occur and may result in death from acute opioid overdose. Respiratory drive may be\nsuppressed in patients with respiratory disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea, emphysema, or cor pulmonale, so\nclose monitoring is necessary when using opioids. Opioid-induced constipation (OIC) is a common adverse effect.\nInitial management includes a nonprescription stimulant laxative such as senna. Peripherally acting μ-opioid\nreceptor antagonists such as methylnaltrexone, naloxegol , and naldemedine are prescription drugs available for the\ntreatment of OIC. [Note: Lubiprostone is a chloride channel activator that is indicated for OIC and irritable bowel\nsyndrome; see",

Tolerance usually does not develop to miosis (constriction of the pupils) or constipation. Physical and\npsychological dependence can occur with morphine and other agonists. Withdrawal produces a series of autonomic,\nmotor, and psychological responses that can be severe, although it is rare that withdrawal effects cause death.\n6.  Drug interactions\nDrug interactions with morphine are possible. The depressant actions of morphine are enhanced by coadministration\nwith CNS depressant medications such as phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and\nbenzodiazepines. Guidelines for opioid prescribing urge clinicians to avoid simultaneous prescribing of opioids and\nbenzodiazepines. A black box warning also has been included on the labeling of both opioids and benzodiazepines\nto alert prescribers of this dangerous combination.\n558\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 559 ---\n\nB.

        "content": "Chapter 1). CYP2D6 activity varies among patients, and ultrarapid metabolizers may experience higher\nlevels of morphine, leading to possible overdose and toxicity. Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have\nbeen reported in children who received codeine, mostly following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. Codeine is\ncommonly used in combination with acetaminophen for management of pain. The drug exhibits good antitussive\nactivity at doses that do not cause analgesia. Dextromethorphan [dex-troe-meth-OR-fan] is a synthetic cough\ndepressant that has relatively no analgesic action and much lower potential for abuse in usual antitussive doses. It is\npreferred over codeine in most situations where cough suppression is needed.\n559\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 560 ---\n\nC.  Oxycodone and oxymorphone\nOxymorphone [ox-ee-MOR-fone] and oxycodone [ok-see-KOE-done] are orally active, semisynthetic analogs of\nmorphine and codeine, respectively. Oxymorphone given parenterally is approximately ten times more potent than\nmorphine, but when administered orally, the potency drops to about three times that of morphine. Oxymorphone is\navailable in both immediate-release and extended-release oral formulations. This agent has no clinically relevant\ndrug interactions associated with the CYP450 enzyme system. Oxycodone is approximately two times more potent\nthan morphine and is available in an immediate-release formulation, alone or in combination with acetaminophen,\naspirin, or ibuprofen. An extended-release formulation is also available. Oxycodone is mainly metabolized via the\nCYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes.\n560\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 561 ---\n\nD.  Hydromorphone and hydrocodone\nHydromorphone [hye-droe-MORE-fone] and hydrocodone [hye-droe-KOE-done] are orally active, semisynthetic\nanalogs of morphine and codeine, respectively. Oral hydromorphone is approximately 4 to 7 times more potent than\noral morphine. It is preferred over morphine in patients with renal dysfunction due to less accumulation of active\nmetabolites. Hydrocodone is the methyl ether derivative of hydromorphone, but is a weaker analgesic than\nhydromorphone, with oral analgesic efficacy comparable to that of morphine. This agent is often combined with\nacetaminophen or ibuprofen to treat moderate to severe pain. It is also used as an antitussive. Hydrocodone is\nmetabolized in the liver to several metabolites, one of which is hydromorphone via the actions of CYP2D6.\n561\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 562 ---\n\nE.  Fentanyl\nFentanyl  [FEN-ta-nil] is a synthetic opioid chemically related to meperidine. Fentanyl  has 100-fold the analgesic\npotency of morphine and is used for anesthesia and acute pain management. The drug is highly lipophilic and has a\nrapid onset and short duration of action (15 to 30 minutes). It is usually administered IV, epidurally, or intrathecally.\nFentanyl  is combined with local anesthetics to provide epidural analgesia for labor and postoperative pain. IV\nfentanyl  is used in anesthesia for its analgesic and sedative effects. Many fast-acting transmucosal and nasal fentanyl\nproducts are available for cancer-related breakthrough pain in opioid-tolerant patients. The transdermal patch creates\na reservoir of the drug in the skin and has a delayed onset of at least 12 hours and a prolonged offset. The patch is\nused for management of chronic severe pain. It is contraindicated in opioid-naïve patients and should not be used in\nmanagement of acute or postoperative pain. Fentanyl  is metabolized to inactive metabolites by CYP3A4, and drugs\nthat inhibit this isoenzyme can potentiate the effect of fentanyl .\n562\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 563 ---\n\nF.  Sufentanil, alfentanil, remifentanil, and carfentanil\nSufentanil  [soo-FEN-ta-nil], alfentanil  [al-FEN-ta-nil], remifentanil  [rem-ih-FEN-ta-nil], and carfentanil  [car-FEN-\nta-nil] are synthetic opioid agonists related to fentanyl . These agents differ in potency and metabolic disposition.\nSufentanil  and carfentanil  are even more potent than fentanyl , whereas the other two are less potent and shorter\nacting. Sufentanil , alfentanil , and remifentanil  are mainly used for their analgesic and sedative properties during\nsurgical procedures requiring anesthesia. Carfentanil  is about 100 times more potent than fentanyl . The drug is not\nused in clinical practice; however, it is of toxicological interest as it is used to lace heroin and has contributed to\nseveral opioid-related deaths.\n563\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 564 ---\n\nG.  Methadone\nMethadone [METH-a-done] is a synthetic, orally effective opioid that has variable equianalgesic potency compared\nto that of morphine, and the conversion between the two products is not linear. Methadone is a μ agonist, an\nantagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, and a norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor.\nTherefore, it is useful in the treatment of both nociceptive and neuropathic pain. Methadone may also be used for\nopioid withdrawal and maintenance therapy in the setting of prescription opioid and heroin abuse. The withdrawal\nsyndrome with methadone is milder but more protracted (days to weeks) than that with other opioids. Methadone\ninduces less euphoria and has a longer duration of action than morphine. Unlike morphine, methadone is well\nabsorbed after oral administration. Methadone is also constipating, but less so than morphine.\nUnderstanding the pharmacokinetics of methadone is important to ensure proper use. After oral administration,\nmethadone is biotransformed in the liver and excreted almost exclusively in the feces. Methadone is very lipophilic,\nrapidly distributed throughout the body, and released slowly during redistribution and elimination. This translates\ninto a long half-life ranging from 12 to 40 hours, although it may extend up to 150 hours. Despite the extended half-\nlife, the actual duration of analgesia ranges from 4 to 8 hours. Attainment of steady state can vary dramatically,\nranging from 35 hours to 2 weeks, so dosage adjustments should occur only every 5 to 7 days. Upon repeated\ndosing, methadone can accumulate due to the long terminal half-life, leading to toxicity. Overdose is possible when\nprescribers are unaware of the long half-life, the incomplete cross-tolerance between methadone and other opioids,\nand the titration guidelines to avoid toxic accumulation. The metabolism is variable due to involvement of multiple\nCYP450 isoenzymes, some of which are affected by known genetic polymorphisms. As such, methadone is\nsusceptible to many drug–drug interactions.\nMethadone can produce physical dependence like that of morphine, but it has less neurotoxicity than morphine\ndue to lack of active metabolites. Methadone can prolong the QTc interval and cause torsades de pointes, possibly by\ninteracting with cardiac potassium channels. Baseline and routine ECG monitoring is recommended.\n564\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 565 ---\n\nH.  Meperidine\nMeperidine [me-PER-i-deen] is a lower-potency synthetic opioid structurally unrelated to morphine. It is used for\nacute pain and acts primarily as a κ agonist, with some μ agonist activity. Meperidine is very lipophilic and has\nanticholinergic effects, resulting in an increased incidence of delirium compared with other opioids. Meperidine has\nan active metabolite (normeperidine), which is potentially neurotoxic. Normeperidine is renally excreted, and in\npatients with renal insufficiency, accumulation of the metabolite may lead to delirium, hyperreflexia, myoclonus,\nand seizures. Due to the short duration of action and the potential for toxicity, meperidine should only be used for\nshort-term (≤48 hours) management of pain. Meperidine should not be used in elderly patients or those with renal\ninsufficiency, hepatic insufficiency, preexisting respiratory compromise, or concomitant or recent administration of\nMAOIs. Serotonin syndrome has been reported in patients receiving both meperidine and selective serotonin\nreuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).\n565\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 566 ---\n\nIV.

In\nthe presence of a full agonist, the agonist–antagonist drugs may precipitate opioid withdrawal symptoms.\n566\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 567 ---\n\nA.  Buprenorphine\nBuprenorphine [byoo-pre-NOR-feen] acts as a potent partial agonist at the μ receptor and an antagonist at the κ\nreceptors. Buprenorphine is very lipophilic and has a longer duration of action due to its high affinity for the opioid\nreceptors when compared to morphine. Due to high affinity for the mu receptor, buprenorphine can displace full μ\nagonists, leading to withdrawal symptoms in an opioid-dependent patient. Because of the partial μ agonist activity,\nbuprenorphine provides a “ceiling effect,” causing less euphoric effects and a lower abuse potential than that of full\nagonists. Additionally, the risk of opioid-induced respiratory depression may be lower when compared with full\nagonists, except when combined with CNS depressants such as benzodiazepines. Buprenorphine is available in\nsublingual, transmucosal, buccal, parenteral, subdermal, and transdermal formulations. The drug is approved for\nmoderate to severe pain. Certain formulations (for example, sublingual and subdermal) are approved for use in\nmedication-assisted treatment of opioid addiction due to its ability to provide prolonged suppression of opioid\nwithdrawal, the ability to block other μ agonists, and less frequent dosing requirements. In contrast to methadone,\nwhich is available only at specialized clinics when used for opioid detoxification or maintenance, buprenorphine is\napproved for office-based treatment of opioid dependence. It has been shown to have shorter and less severe\nwithdrawal symptoms compared to methadone (Figure 14.11). Adverse effects include respiratory depression that\ncannot easily be reversed by naloxone and decreased (or, rarely, increased) blood pressure, nausea, and dizziness.\nAdditionally, buprenorphine has been associated with prolongation of the QTc interval. Although the clinical\nsignificance of this effect is controversial, current labeling for some buprenorphine products includes dosing\nrestrictions due to the concern of QTc prolongation. Risk factors to evaluate when considering buprenorphine\ninclude cardiovascular factors and concurrent drugs that may prolong.\nFigure 14.11 Severity of opioid withdrawal symptoms after abrupt withdrawal of\nequivalent doses of heroin, buprenorphine, and methadone.\n567\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 568 ---\n\n568\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 569 ---\n\nB.  Pentazocine\nPentazocine [pen-TAZ-oh-seen] acts as an agonist on κ receptors and is a weak antagonist or partial agonist at μ\nreceptors. It can be administered either orally or parenterally. Pentazocine produces less euphoria compared to\nmorphine, but in higher doses, respiratory depression, increased blood pressure, tachycardia, and hallucinations can\noccur. For these reasons, pentazocine is rarely used for management of pain. Despite its antagonist action,\npentazocine does not antagonize the respiratory depression of morphine, but it can precipitate withdrawal effects in a\nmorphine user. Pentazocine should be used with caution in patients with angina or coronary artery disease, since it\ncan increase blood pressure.\n569\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 570 ---\n\nC.  Nalbuphine and butorphanol\nNalbuphine [NAL-byoo-feen] and butorphanol  [byoo-TOR-fa-nole] are mixed opioid agonist–antagonists. Like\npentazocine, they play a limited role in the treatment of chronic pain. Butorphanol  is available in a nasal spray that\nhas been used for severe headaches, but it has been associated with abuse. Both products are available in an\ninjectable formulation. Their propensity to cause psychotomimetic effects is less than that of pentazocine. In contrast\nto pentazocine and butorphanol , nalbuphine does not affect the heart or increase blood pressure. A benefit of all\nthree medications is that they exhibit a ceiling effect for respiratory depression.\n570\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 571 ---\n\nV.  Other Analgesics\n571\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 572 ---\n\nA.  Tapentadol\nTapentadol  [ta-PEN-ta-dol], a centrally acting analgesic, is an agonist at the μ opioid receptor and an inhibitor of\nnorepinephrine reuptake. It is used to manage moderate to severe acute and chronic pain, including neuropathic pain\nassociated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Tapentadol  is mainly metabolized to inactive metabolites via\nglucuronidation, and it does not inhibit or induce the CYP450 enzyme system. Because tapentadol  does not produce\nactive metabolites, dosing adjustment is not necessary in mild to moderate renal impairment. Tapentadol  should be\navoided in patients who have received MAOIs within the past 14 days. It is available in an immediate-release and\nextended-release formulation.\n572\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 573 ---\n\nB.  Tramadol\nTramadol  [TRA-ma-dole] is a centrally acting analgesic that binds to the μ opioid receptor. It undergoes extensive\nmetabolism via CYP2D6, leading to an active metabolite, which has a much higher affinity for the mu receptor than\nthe parent compound. In addition, it weakly inhibits reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. It is used to manage\nmoderate to severe pain. Of note, tramadol  has less respiratory-depressant activity compared to morphine.\nAdministration of naloxone can only partially reverse tramadol  toxicity and has been associated with an increased\nrisk of seizures. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported. Overdose or drug–drug interactions with SSRIs,\nMAOIs, and tricyclic antidepressants can lead to toxicity manifested by CNS excitation and seizures. Tramadol\nshould be used with caution in patients with a history of seizures. As with other agents that bind the μ opioid\nreceptor, tramadol  has been associated with misuse and abuse.\n573\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 574 ---\n\nVI.  Antagonists\nThe opioid antagonists bind with high affinity to opioid receptors, but they fail to activate the receptor-mediated\nresponse. Administration of opioid antagonists produces no profound effects in individuals not taking opioids. In\nopioid-dependent patients, antagonists rapidly reverse the effect of agonists, such as morphine or any full μ agonist,\nand precipitate the symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Figure 14.12 summarizes some signs and symptoms of opioid\nwithdrawal.\nFigure 14.12 Opiate withdrawal syndrome. GI = gastrointestinal.\n574\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 575 ---\n\nA.  Naloxone\nNaloxone [nal-OX-own] is a competitive antagonist at μ, κ, and δ receptors, with a 10-fold higher affinity for mu\nthan for kappa receptors. It rapidly displaces all receptor-bound opioid molecules and, therefore, can reverse the\neffects of morphine overdose, such as respiratory depression and coma within 1 to 2 minutes of IV administration.\nNaloxone can also be administered intramuscularly, subcutaneously, and intranasally, with a slightly longer onset of\n2 to 5 minutes; however, little to no clinical effect is seen with oral naloxone due to extensive first-pass metabolism.\nSince naloxone has a half-life of 30 to 81 minutes, a patient who has been treated for an overdose and recovered\nmay lapse back into respiratory depression, depending on the opioid ingested and dosage form of that opioid. [Note:\nMuch higher doses and continuous administration of naloxone are needed to reverse the effects of buprenorphine\ndue to its high affinity for the mu receptor.]\nNaloxone is available in an autoinjector and a nasal inhaler for community distribution for treatment of opioid\noverdose involving heroin or prescription opioids. It is imperative that prescribers counsel the patient and family\nmembers regarding the availability of these products, proper instructions for use, and the importance of calling\nemergency services in the case of overdose.\n575\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 576 ---\n\nB.  Naltrexone\nNaltrexone [nal-TREX-own] has actions similar to those of naloxone, but it has a longer duration of action and can\nbe given orally. For example, a single oral dose of naltrexone blocks the effect of injected heroin for up to 24 hours,\nand the intramuscular formulation blocks the effect for 30 days. Naltrexone in combination with clonidine (and,\nsometimes, with buprenorphine) is used for rapid opioid detoxification. Naltrexone has been reported to cause\nhepatotoxicity and monitoring of hepatic function is recommended.\n576\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 577 ---\n\n14.1\n14.2\n14.3\n14.4\n14.5Study Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nWhich of the agents listed is a phenanthrene opioid that exhibits a full and immediate response to treatment\nwith naloxone in the case of overdose?\nA.  Meperidine\nB.  Morphine\nC.  Buprenorphine\nD.  Fentanyl\nCorrect answer = B. A morphine overdose can be effectively treated with naloxone, and morphine is a\nphenanthrene. Naloxone antagonizes the opioid by displacing it from the receptor, but there are cases in which\nnaloxone is not effective. Meperidine is a phenylpiperidine, not a phenanthrene, and the active metabolite,\nnormeperidine, is not reversible by naloxone. The effects of buprenorphine are only partially reversible by\nnaloxone. In most cases of buprenorphine overdose, the dose of naloxone needs to be high and continuous due to\nthe higher binding affinity to the mu receptor. Naloxone is effective for fentanyl overdoses; however, fentanyl is a\nphenylpiperidine, and not a phenanthrene.\nA 76-year-old female with renal insufficiency has severe pain secondary to a compression fracture in the\nlumbar spine. She reports that the pain has been uncontrolled with tramadol, and it is decided to start\ntreatment with an opioid. Which is the best opioid for this patient?\nA.  Meperidine\nB.  Fentanyl transdermal patch\nC.  Hydrocodone/acetaminophen\nD.  Morphine\nCorrect answer = C. Hydrocodone/acetaminophen is the best choice. It is very important to use a low dose and\nmonitor closely for proper pain control and adverse effects. Meperidine should not be used for chronic pain, nor\nshould it be used in a patient with renal insufficiency. The transdermal patch is not a good option, since her pain\nis considered acute and she is opioid naïve. Morphine is not the best choice due to the active metabolites that can\naccumulate in renal insufficiency.\nWhich statement about buprenorphine is correct?\nA.  Buprenorphine has a much higher incidence of opioid-induced respiratory depression compared to other μ\nagonists.\nB.  Buprenorphine has many dosage formulations, and all formulations can be prescribed for the treatment of pain or\nopioid dependence.\nC.  Buprenorphine has a lower number of drug–drug interactions compared to methadone.\nD.  Buprenorphine is a full μ agonist, an antagonist of the NMDA receptor, and a norepinephrine and serotonin\nreuptake inhibitor.\nCorrect answer = C. Buprenorphine is metabolized by the CYP3A4 system, so there are concerns about drug\ninteractions; however, compared to methadone, which is metabolized by numerous CYP450 enzymes, the drug\ninteraction concern for buprenorphine is much lower. Buprenorphine has a lower incidence of opioid-induced\nrespiratory depression compared to the μ agonists due to the ceiling effect created by the partial μ agonist activity.\nBuprenorphine is available in many different dosage formulations, but these formulations are indicated for either\npain management or medication-assisted treatment of opioid dependence, not both. Option D describes the\nmechanism of action of methadone. Buprenorphine is a potent partial μ agonist and a κ antagonist.\nA 56-year-old patient has suffered with painful diabetic neuropathy and severe chronic back pain with\nradiculopathy secondary to spinal stenosis for many years. This patient has failed to receive relief from his\nneuropathic pain with first-line agents such as tricyclics, SNRIs, or anticonvulsants. Based on the mechanism\nof action, which opioid could be considered in this patient to treat both nociceptive and neuropathic pain?\nA.  Meperidine\nB.  Oxymorphone\nC.  Morphine\nD.  Tapentadol\nCorrect answer = D. Tapentadol has a unique mechanism of action in comparison with the other choices given.\nTapentadol has a dual mechanism of action (μ agonist and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition), which has been\nshown to effectively treat neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. All other μ agonists\ncould help manage neuropathic pain, but in some situations, higher doses of opioids are needed to achieve\nefficacy.\nWhich of the following statements regarding methadone is correct?\nA.  Methadone is an excellent choice for analgesia in most patients because there are limited drug–drug interactions.\nB.  The equianalgesic potency of methadone is similar to that of morphine.\nC.  The duration of analgesia for methadone is much shorter than the elimination half-life.577\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 578 ---\n\n14.6\n14.7\n14.8\n14.9\n14.10D.  The active metabolites of methadone accumulate in patients with renal dysfunction.\nCorrect Answer = C. The duration of analgesia is much shorter than the elimination half-life, leading to dangers\nof accumulation and increased potential for respiratory depression and death. The equianalgesic potency of\nmethadone is extremely variable based on many factors, and only providers familiar with methadone should\nprescribe this agent. The drug interactions associated with methadone are numerous due to the multiple liver\nenzymes that metabolize the drug. Methadone does not have active metabolites, which makes it a treatment\noption in patients with renal dysfunction.\nAN is a 57-year-old man who has been treated with oxycodone for chronic nonmalignant pain for over 2\nyears. He now reports increased pain in the afternoon while at work. Which of the following is a short-acting\nopioid and is the best choice for this patient’s breakthrough pain?\nA.  Methadone\nB.  Fentanyl\nC.  Hydrocodone\nD.  Nalbuphine\nCorrect answer = C. Hydrocodone is a commonly used short-acting agent that is commercially available in\ncombination with either acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Methadone should not routinely be used for breakthrough\npain due to the unique pharmacokinetics and should be reserved for practitioners who have experience with this\nagent and understand the variables associated with this drug. Fentanyl is available in formulations for treatment of\nbreakthrough pain for cancer treatment. It is not appropriate to use fentanyl in this type of chronic pain setting.\nNalbuphine is a mixed agonist/antagonist analgesic that could precipitate withdrawal in patients who are currently\ntaking a full μ agonist such as oxycodone.\nA 64-year-old man is preparing for a total knee replacement. He is taking many medications that are\nmetabolized by the CYP450 enzyme system and is worried about drug interactions with the pain medication\nthat will be used following surgery. Which of the following opioids would have the lowest chance of drug\ninteractions in this patient?\nA.  Methadone\nB.  Tapentadol\nC.  Tramadol\nD.  Oxycodone\nCorrect answer = B. Tapentadol is metabolized via glucuronidation and has not been shown to have any clinically\nrelevant drug interactions associated with the CYP450 enzyme family. All other opioids listed are metabolized by\none or more CYP450 enzymes and increase the risk of drug interactions.\nWhich of the following statements regarding adverse effects of opioid therapy is correct?\nA.  The risk of respiratory depression is highest during an initial opioid initiation or following a dose increase.\nB.  Opioid-induced constipation is only seen with the initiation of opioid therapy.\nC.  The incidence of nausea and sedation increases with long-term use of opioid therapy.\nD.  Decreased testosterone levels are commonly seen with short-term use of opioid therapy.\nCorrect answer = A. The risk of respiratory depression is highest when the opioid is first initiated or a dosage is\nraised (or sometimes a drug–drug interaction leads to higher opioid levels). Opioid-induced constipation can\noccur at any time during the therapy, and a patient does not develop a tolerance to this side effect. Side effects\nsuch as nausea and sedation commonly decrease after repeated dosing due to development of tolerance to these\nadverse effects. Chronic opioid exposure has been linked to decreased testosterone levels in males.\nKM is a 64-year-old man who has been hospitalized following a car accident in which he sustained a broken\nleg and broken arm. He has been converted to oral morphine in anticipation of discharge from the hospital.\nUpon discharge, which medication should he receive along with the morphine?\nA.  Diphenhydramine\nB.  Methylphenidate\nC.  Senna\nD.  Docusate sodium\nCorrect answer = C. A bowel regimen should be prescribed with the initiation of the opioid since constipation is\nvery common and can occur at any time, and tolerance to this adverse effect does not occur. Senna is a stimulant\nthat is available over-the-counter. Docusate sodium is a stool softener that is ineffective in opioid-induced\nconstipation when used as a single agent. Combination products that include both docusate and senna are\ncommonly used and can be effective, mainly due to the actions of senna. Diphenhydramine can be used for\nurticaria that might occur with the initiation of an opioid, and methylphenidate has been used for opioid-induced\nsedation in certain situations, but these issues are not reported in this case.\nAN is a 67-year-old man who has been treated with oxycodone for chronic nonmalignant pain with no\nchanges in the dosing regimen for over 2 years. His pain has been fairly well controlled, and he remains\nactive, reports satisfaction with his pain regimen, and denies any side effects. He has been recently diagnosed578\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 579 ---\n\nwith COPD and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Which of the following options is the best treatment\nrecommendation for him at this time?\nA.  Taper off all opioids due to increased risk of opioid-induced respiratory depression.\nB.  Prescribe naloxone nasal spray to have at home in case he experiences an opioid overdose.\nC.  Prescribe oral naloxone tablets to have at home in case he experiences an opioid overdose.\nD.  No action is needed at this time. His pain is well controlled, and he is reporting no side effects.\nCorrect answer = B. Because this patient has just been diagnosed with COPD and OSA, it is clear his risk for\nopioid-induced respiratory depression is greater. Since the pain is controlled and no side effects are reported,\ntapering off the opioids at this time is not the best answer. Because of the first-pass effect, naloxone is not\nclinically effective for management of an overdose when given orally. Therefore, the nasal spray is the best\nchoice. Offering the at-home naloxone nasal spray, along with proper education, might be lifesaving if an\noverdose occurs. Providing proper education to the patient and caregivers on the importance of having the\nnaloxone nasal spray at home and of calling emergency services is critical in case of an overdose situation.\n579\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 580 ---\n\n15\nCNS Stimulants\nJose A. Rey\n580\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 581 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nPsychomotor stimulants and hallucinogens are two groups of drugs that act primarily to stimulate the central\nnervous system (CNS). The psychomotor stimulants cause excitement and euphoria, decrease feelings of fatigue,\nand increase motor activity. The hallucinogens produce profound changes in thought patterns and mood, with little\neffect on the brainstem and spinal cord. As a group, the CNS stimulants have diverse clinical uses and are also\npotential drugs of abuse, as are the CNS depressants (",

Psychomotor Stimulants\n582\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 583 ---\n\nA.  Methylxanthines\nThe methylxanthines include theophylline [thee-OFF-i-lin], which is found in tea; theobromine [thee-oh-BROE-\nmeen], which is found in cocoa; and caffeine [kaf-EEN]. Caffeine, the most widely consumed stimulant in the world,\nis found in highest concentration in certain coffee products (for example, espresso), but it is also present in tea, cola\ndrinks, energy drinks, chocolate candy, and cocoa.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nSeveral mechanisms have been proposed for the actions of methylxanthines, including translocation of extracellular\ncalcium, increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate and cyclic guanosine monophosphate caused by inhibition of\nphosphodiesterase, and blockade of adenosine receptors.\n2.  Actions\na.  CNS\nThe caffeine contained in one to two cups of coffee (100 to 200 mg) causes a decrease in fatigue and increased\nmental alertness as a result of stimulating the cortex and other areas of the brain. Consumption of 1.5 g of caffeine\n(12 to 15 cups of coffee) produces anxiety and tremors. The spinal cord is stimulated only by very high doses (2 to 5\ng) of caffeine. Tolerance can rapidly develop to the stimulating properties of caffeine, and withdrawal consists of\nfeelings of fatigue and sedation.\nb.  Cardiovascular system\nA high dose of caffeine has positive inotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart. [Note: Increased contractility\ncan be harmful to patients with angina pectoris. In others, an accelerated heart rate can trigger premature ventricular\ncontractions.]\nc.  Diuretic action\nCaffeine has a mild diuretic action that increases urinary output of sodium, chloride, and potassium.\nd.  Gastric mucosa\nBecause methylxanthines stimulate secretion of gastric acid, individuals with peptic ulcers should avoid foods and\nbeverages containing methylxanthines.\n3.  Therapeutic uses\nCaffeine and its derivatives relax the smooth muscles of the bronchioles. Theophylline has been largely replaced by\nother agents, such as β2 agonists and corticosteroids, for the treatment of asthma (see",

Caffeine is also\nused in combination with the analgesics acetaminophen and aspirin for the management of headaches in both\nprescription and over-the-counter products.\n4.  Pharmacokinetics\nThe methylxanthines are well absorbed orally. Caffeine distributes throughout the body, including the brain. These\ndrugs cross the placenta to the fetus and are secreted into the breast milk. All methylxanthines are metabolized in the\nliver, generally by the CYP1A2 pathway, and the metabolites are excreted in the urine.\n5.  Adverse effects\nModerate doses of caffeine cause insomnia, anxiety, and agitation. A high dosage is required for toxicity, which is\nmanifested by emesis and convulsions. The lethal dose is 10 g of caffeine (about 100 cups of coffee), which induces\ncardiac arrhythmias. Lethargy, irritability, and headache occur in users who routinely consume more than 600 mg of\ncaffeine per day (roughly six cups of coffee per day) and then suddenly stop.\n583\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 584 ---\n\nB.  Nicotine\nNicotine [NIK-o-teen] is the active ingredient in tobacco. Although this drug is not currently used therapeutically\n(except in smoking cessation therapy), nicotine remains important because it is second only to caffeine as the most\nwidely used CNS stimulant, and it is second only to alcohol as the most abused drug. In combination with the tars\nand carbon monoxide found in cigarette smoke, nicotine represents a serious risk factor for lung and cardiovascular\ndisease, and other illnesses.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nIn low doses, nicotine causes ganglionic stimulation by depolarization. At high doses, nicotine causes ganglionic\nblockade. Nicotine receptors exist at a number of sites in the CNS, which participate in the stimulant attributes of the\ndrug.\n2.  Actions\na.  CNS\nNicotine is highly lipid soluble and readily crosses the blood–brain barrier. Cigarette smoking or administration of\nlow doses of nicotine produces some degree of euphoria and arousal, as well as relaxation. It improves attention,\nlearning, problem solving, and reaction time. High doses of nicotine result in central respiratory paralysis and severe\nhypotension caused by medullary paralysis (Figure 15.2). Nicotine is also an appetite suppressant.\nFigure 15.2 Actions of nicotine on the CNS.\nb.  Peripheral effects\nThe peripheral effects of nicotine are complex. Stimulation of sympathetic ganglia as well as of the adrenal medulla\nincreases blood pressure and heart rate. Thus, use of tobacco is particularly harmful in hypertensive patients. Many\npatients with peripheral vascular disease experience an exacerbation of symptoms with smoking. In addition,\nnicotine-induced vasoconstriction can decrease coronary blood flow, adversely affecting a patient with angina.\nStimulation of parasympathetic ganglia also increases motor activity of the bowel. At higher doses, blood pressure\nfalls and activity ceases in both the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and bladder musculature as a result of a nicotine-\ninduced block of parasympathetic ganglia.\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\nBecause nicotine is highly lipid soluble, absorption readily occurs via the oral mucosa, lungs, GI mucosa, and skin.\nNicotine crosses the placental membrane and is secreted in the breast milk. By inhaling tobacco smoke, the average\nsmoker takes in 1 to 2 mg of nicotine per cigarette. The acute lethal dose is 60 mg. More than 90% of the nicotine\ninhaled in smoke is absorbed. Clearance of nicotine involves metabolism in the lung and the liver and urinary584\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 585 ---\n\nexcretion. Tolerance to the toxic effects of nicotine develops rapidly, often within days.\n4.  Adverse effects\nThe CNS effects of nicotine include irritability and tremors. Nicotine may also cause intestinal cramps, diarrhea, and\nincreased heart rate and blood pressure. In addition, cigarette smoking increases the rate of metabolism for a number\nof drugs.\n5.  Withdrawal syndrome\nAs with the other drugs in this class, nicotine is an addictive substance, and physical dependence develops rapidly\nand can be severe (Figure 15.3). Withdrawal is characterized by irritability, anxiety, restlessness, difficulty\nconcentrating, headaches, and insomnia. Appetite is affected, and GI upset often occurs. The transdermal patch and\nchewing gum containing nicotine have been shown to reduce nicotine withdrawal symptoms and to help smokers\nstop smoking. For example, the blood concentration of nicotine obtained from nicotine chewing gum is typically\nabout one-half the peak level observed with smoking (Figure 15.4). Other forms of nicotine replacement used for\nsmoking cessation include the inhaler, nasal spray, and lozenges. Bupropion, an antidepressant (",

Varenicline\nVarenicline [ver-EN-ih-kleen] is a partial agonist at neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the CNS. Because\nvarenicline is only a partial agonist at these receptors, it produces less euphoric effects than nicotine (nicotine is a\nfull agonist). Thus, it is useful as an adjunct in the management of smoking cessation in patients with nicotine\nwithdrawal symptoms. Patients taking varenicline should be monitored for suicidal thoughts, vivid nightmares, and\nmood changes.\n588\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 589 ---\n\nD.  Cocaine\nCocaine [koe-KANE] is a widely available and highly addictive drug. Because of its abuse potential, cocaine is\nclassified as a Schedule II drug by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency. The primary mechanism of action\nunderlying the effects of cocaine is blockade of reuptake of the monoamines (norepinephrine, serotonin, and\ndopamine) into the presynaptic terminals. This potentiates and prolongs the CNS and peripheral actions of these\nmonoamines. In particular, the prolongation of dopaminergic effects in the brain’s pleasure system (limbic system)\nproduces the intense euphoria that cocaine initially causes. Chronic intake of cocaine depletes dopamine. This\ndepletion triggers craving for cocaine (Figure 15.5). A full description of cocaine and its effects is provided in",

        "content": "Chapter 45).\n1.  Mechanism of action\nAs with cocaine, the effects of amphetamine on the CNS and peripheral nervous system are indirect. That is, both\ndepend upon an elevation of the level of catecholamine neurotransmitters in synaptic spaces. Amphetamine,\nhowever, achieves this effect by releasing intracellular stores of catecholamines ( Figure 15.6). Because\namphetamine also inhibits monoamine oxidase (MAO) and is a weak reuptake transport inhibitor, high levels of\ncatecholamines are present in synaptic spaces. Despite different mechanisms of action, the behavioral effects of\namphetamine and its derivatives are similar to those of cocaine.\n590\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 591 ---\n\n591\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 592 ---\n\nFigure 15.6 Mechanism of action of amphetamine .\n2.  Actions\na.  CNS\nThe major behavioral effects of amphetamine result from a combination of its dopamine and norepinephrine\nrelease–enhancing properties. Amphetamine stimulates the entire cerebrospinal axis, cortex, brainstem, and medulla.\nThis leads to increased alertness, decreased fatigue, depressed appetite, and insomnia. The CNS stimulant effects of\namphetamine and its derivatives have led to their use in the treatment of hyperactivity in children, narcolepsy, and\nobesity. At high doses, psychosis and convulsions may occur.\nb.  Sympathetic nervous system\nIn addition to marked action on the CNS, amphetamine acts on the adrenergic system, indirectly stimulating the\nreceptors through norepinephrine release.\n3.  Therapeutic uses\nFactors that limit the therapeutic usefulness of amphetamine include psychological and physiologic dependence.\na.  Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\nSome children are hyperkinetic and lack the ability to be involved in any activity for longer than a few minutes.\nDextroamphetamine, methamphetamine, the mixed amphetamine salts, and methylphenidate [meth-ill-FEN-ih-date]\nhelp improve attention span and alleviate many of the behavioral problems associated with this syndrome, in\naddition to reducing hyperkinesia. Lisdexamfetamine [lis-dex-am-FET-a-meen] is a prodrug that is converted to L-\nlysine and the active component dextroamphetamine through the hydrolytic actions of red blood cells. Atomoxetine\n[AT-oh-MOX-ih-teen] is a nonstimulant drug approved for ADHD in children and adults. Unlike methylphenidate,\nwhich blocks dopamine reuptake more than norepinephrine reuptake, atomoxetine is more selective for inhibition of\nnorepinephrine reuptake. Therefore, it is not considered habit forming and is not a controlled substance.\nb.  Narcolepsy\nNarcolepsy is a relatively rare sleep disorder that is characterized by uncontrollable bouts of sleepiness during the\nday. The sleepiness can be treated with drugs, such as the mixed amphetamine salts or methylphenidate. Modafinil\n[moe-DA-fi-nil] and its R-enantiomer derivative, armodafinil  [ar-moe-DA-fi-nil], are considered first-line agents for\nthe treatment of narcolepsy. Modafinil  promotes wakefulness, but it produces less psychoactive and euphoric effects\nand fewer alterations in mood, perception, thinking, and feelings typical of other CNS stimulants. The mechanism of\naction remains unclear but may involve the adrenergic and dopaminergic systems. Modafinil  is well distributed\nthroughout the body and undergoes elimination via hepatic metabolism and excretion in the urine. Headaches,\nnausea, and nervousness are the primary adverse effects. Modafinil  and armodafinil  may have some potential for\nabuse and physical dependence, and both are classified as controlled substances.\nc.  Appetite suppression\nPhentermine [FEN-ter-meen] and diethylpropion [dye-eth-ill-PROE-pee-on] are sympathomimetic amines that are\nrelated structurally to amphetamine. These agents are used for appetite suppressant effects in the management of\nobesity (see",

[Note:\nAdministration of urinary alkalinizing agents such as sodium bicarbonate increase the nonionized species of the\ndrug and enhance the reabsorption of dextroamphetamine from the renal tubules into the bloodstream.]\nAmphetamine abusers often administer the drug by IV injection and/or by smoking. The euphoria caused by\namphetamine lasts 4 to 6 hours, or four- to eightfold longer than the effects of cocaine.\n5.  Adverse effects\nThe amphetamines may cause addiction, leading to dependence, tolerance, and drug-seeking behavior. In addition,\nthey have the following undesirable effects:\na.  CNS effects\nAdverse effects of amphetamine usage include insomnia, irritability, weakness, dizziness, tremor, and hyperactive\nreflexes (Figure 15.7). Amphetamine can also cause confusion, delirium, panic states, and suicidal tendencies,\nespecially in mentally ill patients. [Note: Benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam, are often used in the management of\nagitation and CNS stimulation secondary to amphetamine overdose.] Chronic amphetamine use produces a state of\n“amphetamine psychosis” that resembles the psychotic episodes associated with schizophrenia. Whereas long-term\namphetamine use is associated with psychological and physical dependence, tolerance to its effects may occur\nwithin a few weeks. The anorectic effect of amphetamine is due to action in the lateral hypothalamic feeding center.\n592\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 593 ---\n\n593\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 594 ---\n\nFigure 15.7 Adverse effects of amphetamines and methylphenidate.\nb.  Cardiovascular effects\nIn addition to CNS effects, amphetamine may cause palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, anginal pain,\nand circulatory collapse. Headache, chills, and excessive sweating may also occur.\nc.  Gastrointestinal effects\nAmphetamine acts on the GI system, causing anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea.\nd.  Contraindications\nPatients with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, or a history of drug abuse or those\ntaking MAO inhibitors should not be treated with amphetamine.\n594\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 595 ---\n\nF.  Methylphenidate\nMethylphenidate has CNS stimulant properties similar to those of amphetamine and is often used in the treatment of\nADHD. Methylphenidate has abuse potential and is a Schedule II controlled substance. The pharmacologically\nactive isomer, dexmethylphenidate, is also a Schedule II drug used for the treatment of ADHD.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nChildren with ADHD may produce weak dopamine signals, which suggest that once-interesting activities provide\nfewer rewards to these children. Methylphenidate is a dopamine and norepinephrine transport inhibitor and may act\nby increasing both dopamine and norepinephrine in the synaptic cleft.\n2.  Therapeutic uses\nMethylphenidate is used in the treatment of ADHD. It is also effective in the treatment of narcolepsy. Unlike\nmethylphenidate, dexmethylphenidate is not indicated in the treatment of narcolepsy.\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\nBoth methylphenidate and dexmethylphenidate are readily absorbed after oral administration. Methylphenidate is\navailable in extended-release oral formulations and as a transdermal patch for once-daily application. The\ndeesterified product, ritalinic acid, is excreted in urine.\n4.  Adverse effects\nGI adverse effects are the most common and include abdominal pain and nausea. Other reactions include anorexia,\ninsomnia, nervousness, and fever. In patients with epilepsy, methylphenidate may increase seizure frequency. The\ndrug is contraindicated in patients with glaucoma. Methylphenidate can inhibit the metabolism of warfarin,\nphenytoin, phenobarbital , primidone, and the tricyclic antidepressants.\n595\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 596 ---\n\nIII.  Hallucinogens\nA few drugs have, as their primary action, the ability to induce altered perceptual states reminiscent of dreams.\nMany of these altered states are accompanied by visions of bright, colorful changes in the environment and by a\nplasticity of constantly changing shapes and color. The individual under the influence of these drugs is incapable of\nnormal decision-making because the drug interferes with rational thought. These compounds are known as\nhallucinogens, and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and tetrahydrocannabinol  (from marijuana) are examples of\nagents in this class.

Psychiatric\nexamination revealed that he had injected dextroamphetamine several times in the past few days. The last use\nwas 10 hours prior. He was given an intramuscular drug that sedated him, and he fell asleep. Which drug was\nmost likely used to counter this patient’s symptoms of dextroamphetamine withdrawal?\nA.  Trazodone\nB.  Lorazepam\nC.  Cocaine\nD.  Hydroxyzine\nCorrect answer = B. The anxiolytic properties of benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam, make them the drugs of\nchoice in treating the anxiety and agitation of amphetamine or cocaine abuse. Lorazepam also has hypnotic\nproperties. Trazodone has hypnotic properties, but its anxiolytic properties are inferior to those of the\nbenzodiazepines. Hydroxyzine, an antihistamine, is effective as a hypnotic, and it is sometimes used to deal with\nanxiety, especially if emesis is a problem but it is rarely used in the emergency situation when rapid anxiolytic\nand antiseizure treatment is warranted.\nA 10-year-old boy is sent to a pediatric neurologist for an evaluation due to poor performance and inability\nto pay attention in school. He has also been fighting with other children. He is given a diagnosis of ADHD\nwith impulsivity and irritability. Which is most appropriate for management of the ADHD?\nA.  Clonidine\nB.  Mirtazapine\nC.  Dextroamphetamine\nD.  Haloperidol\nCorrect answer = C. Dextroamphetamine is the only stimulant medication in the list that is approved for ADHD.\nSymptoms like fighting may improve with haloperidol, and hyperactivity may improve with clonidine, but these\nagents would not improve the patient’s academic performance and the underlying problems.\nA 10-year-old boy with ADHD has symptoms that are controlled with an oral psychostimulant. However, he\nand his family wish to avoid having to give a second dose of medication at school. They prefer an alternative\ntreatment that can be administered in the morning and last the entire day. Which treatment option is best?\nA.  Mixed amphetamine salts in immediate-release oral tablet formulation\nB.  Methylphenidate in a transdermal delivery system\nC.  Nicotine in a chewing gum formulation for buccal absorption\nD.  Methylphenidate in immediate-release pills\nCorrect answer = B. Methylphenidate is also a psychostimulant, and the transdermal (patch) formulation is\ndesigned for once-daily use to avoid midday dosing. Immediate-release formulations require dosing at least twice\ndaily.\nWhich of the following agents for ADHD is a controlled substance (Schedule II)?\nA.  Clonidine\nB.  Atomoxetine\nC.  Lisdexamfetamine\nD.  Desipramine\nCorrect answer = C. Lisdexamfetamine is the only controlled substance on the list and is schedule II. The other\nagents may assist in the management of ADHD but are not controlled substances.\nAmphetamines may be used in patients with which of the following conditions?\nA.  Cardiovascular disease\nB.  Hypertension\nC.  Hyperthyroidism\nD.  Obesity\nCorrect answer = D. The use of amphetamines in the management of obesity should be closely monitored.\nAmphetamine analogs such as phentermine are approved for obesity. The other conditions are contraindications\nwhen considering the use of amphetamines.\nWhich of the following agents is considered a first-line treatment for narcolepsy?\nA.  Galantamine\nB.  Atomoxetine\nC.  Temazepam\nD.  Modafinil597\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 598 ---\n\n15.7\n15.8\n15.9\n15.10Correct answer = D. Modafinil is the only drug listed that is approved for narcolepsy. Temazepam is indicated for\ninsomnia, galantamine for Alzheimer’s disease, and atomoxetine for ADHD.\nWhich of the following is a common adverse effect of amphetamines?\nA.  Bradycardia\nB.  Somnolence\nC.  Constipation\nD.  Hypertension\nCorrect answer = D. Hypertension is a possible adverse effect that warrants caution, especially in individuals with\nrisk factors for increased blood pressure. Amphetamines cause tachycardia (not bradycardia), insomnia (not\nsomnolence), and diarrhea (not constipation).\nWhich of the following CNS stimulants occurs naturally and can be found in certain candies?\nA.  Amphetamine\nB.  Modafinil\nC.  Caffeine\nD.  Atomoxetine\nCorrect answer = C. Caffeine is a naturally occurring substance found in cocoa, chocolate, and many forms of tea.\nOveruse of cola beverages and other caffeine-containing products may cause adverse effects, including anxiety\nand insomnia, and even increase the risk for seizures.\nA 35-year-old man is interested in quitting smoking. In previous quit attempts, he has tried nicotine gum, the\nnicotine patch, and the “cold turkey” method. He has been unsuccessful in each of these attempts and\nresumed smoking within 4 to 6 weeks. Which may be useful to assist in his attempt to quit smoking?\nA.  Varenicline\nB.  Dextroamphetamine\nC.  Lorazepam\nD.  Methylphenidate\nCorrect answer = A. Varenicline is approved as an adjunctive treatment option for the management of nicotine\ndependence. It is believed to attenuate the withdrawal symptoms of smoking cessation, though monitoring is\nneeded for changes in psychiatric status, including suicidal ideation. The use of dextroamphetamine, lorazepam,\nand methylphenidate bring the risk of addiction to another substance with abuse potential.\nWhich of the following agents carries the lowest risk for addiction?\nA.

Overview\nBlood pressure is elevated when systolic blood pressure exceeds 120 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure remains\nbelow 80 mm Hg. Hypertension occurs when systolic blood pressure exceeds 130 mm Hg or diastolic blood\npressure exceeds 80 mm Hg on at least two occasions. Hypertension results from increased peripheral vascular\narteriolar smooth muscle tone, which leads to increased arteriolar resistance and reduced capacitance of the venous\nsystem. In most cases, the cause of the increased vascular tone is unknown. Elevated blood pressure is a common\ndisorder, affecting approximately 30% of adults in the United States. Although many patients have no symptoms,\nchronic hypertension can lead to heart disease and stroke, the top two causes of death in the world. Hypertension is\nalso an important risk factor in the development of chronic kidney disease and heart failure. The incidence of\nmorbidity and mortality significantly decreases when hypertension is diagnosed early and is properly treated. The\ndrugs used in the treatment of hypertension are shown in Figure 16.1. In recognition of the progressive nature of\nhypertension, hypertension is classified into four categories (Figure 16.2). The majority of current guidelines\nrecommend treatment decisions based on goals of antihypertensive therapy, rather than the category of hypertension.\n601\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 602 ---\n\nFigure 16.1 Summary of antihypertensive drugs. ACE = angiotensin converting enzyme.\n(Figure continues on next page)\n602\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 603 ---\n\nFigure 16.2 Classification of blood pressure.\n603\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 604 ---\n\nII.  Etiology of Hypertension\nAlthough hypertension may occur secondary to other disease processes, more than 90% of patients have essential\nhypertension (hypertension with no identifiable cause). A family history of hypertension increases the likelihood\nthat an individual will develop hypertension. The prevalence of hypertension increases with age but decreases with\neducation and income level. Non-Hispanic blacks have a higher incidence of hypertension than do both non-\nHispanic whites and Hispanic whites. Persons with diabetes, obesity, or disability status are all more likely to have\nhypertension than those without these conditions. In addition, environmental factors, such as a stressful lifestyle,\nhigh dietary intake of sodium, and smoking, may further predispose an individual to hypertension.\n604\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 605 ---\n\nIII.  Mechanisms for Controlling Blood Pressure\nArterial blood pressure is regulated within a narrow range to provide adequate perfusion of the tissues without\ncausing damage to the vascular system, particularly the arterial intima (endothelium). Arterial blood pressure is\ndirectly proportional to cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance (Figure 16.3). Cardiac output and\nperipheral resistance, in turn, are controlled mainly by two overlapping mechanisms: the baroreflexes and the renin–\nangiotensin–aldosterone system (Figure 16.4). Most antihypertensive drugs lower blood pressure by reducing\ncardiac output and/or decreasing peripheral resistance.\nFigure 16.3 Major factors influencing blood pressure.\n605\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 606 ---\n\nFigure 16.4 Response of the autonomic nervous system and the renin–angiotensin–\naldosterone system to a decrease in blood pressure.\n606\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 607 ---\n\nA.  Baroreceptors and the sympathetic nervous system\nBaroreflexes act by changing the activity of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. Therefore, they\nare responsible for the rapid, moment-to-moment regulation of blood pressure. A fall in blood pressure causes\npressure-sensitive neurons (baroreceptors in the aortic arch and carotid sinuses) to send fewer impulses to\ncardiovascular centers in the spinal cord. This prompts a reflex response of increased sympathetic and decreased\nparasympathetic output to the heart and vasculature, resulting in vasoconstriction and increased cardiac output.\nThese changes result in a compensatory rise in blood pressure (Figure 16.4).\n607\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 608 ---\n\nB.  Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system\nThe kidney provides long-term control of blood pressure by altering the blood volume. Baroreceptors in the kidney\nrespond to reduced arterial pressure (and to sympathetic stimulation of β1-adrenoceptors) by releasing the enzyme\nrenin (Figure 16.4). Low-sodium intake and greater sodium loss also increase renin release. Renin converts\nangiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is converted in turn to angiotensin II, in the presence of angiotensin\nconverting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II is a potent circulating vasoconstrictor, constricting both arterioles and\nveins, resulting in an increase in blood pressure. Angiotensin II exerts a preferential vasoconstrictor action on the\nefferent arterioles of the renal glomerulus, increasing glomerular filtration. Furthermore, angiotensin II stimulates\naldosterone secretion, leading to increased renal sodium reabsorption and increased blood volume, which contribute\nto a further increase in blood pressure. These effects of angiotensin II are mediated by stimulation of angiotensin II\ntype 1 (AT1) receptors.\n608\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 609 ---\n\nIV.  Treatment Strategies\nThe goal of antihypertensive therapy is to reduce cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. For most\npatients, the blood pressure goal when treating hypertension is a systolic blood pressure of less than 130 mm Hg and\na diastolic blood pressure of less than 80 mm Hg. Current recommendations are to initiate therapy with a thiazide\ndiuretic, ACE inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), or calcium channel blocker. However, initial drug\ntherapy choice may vary depending on the guideline and concomitant diseases (Figure 16.5). If blood pressure is\ninadequately controlled, a second drug should be added, with the selection based on minimizing the adverse effects\nof the combined regimen and achieving goal blood pressure. Patients with systolic blood pressure greater than 20\nmm Hg above goal or diastolic blood pressure more than 10 mm Hg above goal should be started on two\nantihypertensives simultaneously. Combination therapy with separate agents or a fixed-dose combination pill may\nlower blood pressure more quickly with minimal adverse effects. A variety of combination formulations of the\nvarious pharmacologic classes are available to increase ease of patient adherence to treatment regimens that require\nmultiple medications.\nFigure 16.5 Comparison of blood pressure goals and initial drug therapy with various\nguidelines for hypertension. ACC = American College of Cardiology; ACE = angiotensin\nconverting enzyme; ADA = American Diabetes Association; AHA = American Heart\nAssociation; ARB = angiotensin receptor blocker; CCB = calcium channel blocker; CKD\n= chronic kidney disease; ESC = European Society of Cardiology; ESH = European\nSociety of Hypertension; JNC 8 = Eighth Joint National Committee; KDIGO = Kidney\nDisease: Improving Global Outcomes; NICE = National Institute for Health and Care\nExcellence.\n609\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 610 ---\n\nA.  Individualized care\nHypertension may coexist with other conditions that can be aggravated by some of the antihypertensive drugs or that\nmay benefit from the use of some antihypertensive drugs independent of blood pressure control. In such cases, it is\nimportant to match antihypertensive drugs to the particular patient. Figure 16.6 shows preferred therapies in\nhypertensive patients with concomitant diseases. In addition to the choice of therapy, blood pressure goals may also\nbe individualized based on concurrent disease states and age (Figure 16.5).\nFigure 16.6 Treatment of hypertension in patients with concomitant diseases.

Diuretics\nFor all classes of diuretics, the initial mechanism of action is based upon decreasing blood volume, which ultimately\nleads to decreased blood pressure. Routine serum electrolyte monitoring should be done for all patients receiving\ndiuretics.

Actions\nThe β-blockers reduce blood pressure primarily by decreasing cardiac output (Figure 16.8). They may also decrease\nsympathetic outflow from the central nervous system (CNS) and inhibit the release of renin from the kidneys, thus\ndecreasing the formation of angiotensin II and the secretion of aldosterone. The prototype β-blocker is propranolol\n[proe-PRAN-oh-lol], which acts at both β1 and β2 receptors. Selective blockers of β1 receptors, such as metoprolol\n[met-OH-pro-lol] and atenolol  [ah-TEN-oh-lol], are among the most commonly prescribed β-blockers. Nebivolol\n[ne-BIV-oh-lole] is a selective blocker of β1 receptors, which also increases the production of nitric oxide, leading to\nvasodilation. The selective β-blockers may be administered cautiously to hypertensive patients who also have\nasthma. The nonselective β-blockers are contraindicated in patients with asthma due to their blockade of β2-\nmediated bronchodilation. (See",

Therapeutic uses\nThe primary therapeutic benefits of β-blockers are seen in hypertensive patients with concomitant heart disease,\nsuch as supraventricular tachyarrhythmia (for example, atrial fibrillation), previous myocardial infarction, stable\nischemic heart disease, and chronic heart failure. Conditions that discourage the use of β-blockers include reversible\nbronchospastic disease such as asthma, second- and third-degree heart block, and severe peripheral vascular disease.\n617\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 618 ---\n\nC.  Pharmacokinetics\nThe β-blockers are orally active for the treatment of hypertension. Propranolol  undergoes extensive and highly\nvariable first-pass metabolism. Oral β-blockers may take several weeks to develop their full effects. Esmolol ,\nmetoprolol , and propranolol  are available in intravenous formulations.\n618\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 619 ---\n\nD.  Adverse effects\n1.  Common effects\nFigure 16.9 describes some of the adverse effects of β-blockers. The β-blockers may decrease libido and cause\nerectile dysfunction, which can severely reduce patient compliance.\n619\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 620 ---\n\nFigure 16.9 Some adverse effects of β-blockers.\n620\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 621 ---\n\n2.  Alterations in serum lipid patterns\nNoncardioselective β-blockers may disturb lipid metabolism, decreasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and\nincreasing triglycerides.\n3.  Drug withdrawal\nAbrupt withdrawal may induce severe hypertension, angina, myocardial infarction, and even sudden death in\npatients with ischemic heart disease. Therefore, these drugs must be tapered over a few weeks in patients with\nhypertension and ischemic heart disease.\n621\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 622 ---\n\nVII.  ACE Inhibitors\nACE inhibitors such as captopril  [KAP-toe-pril], enalapril  [e-NAL-ah-pril], and lisinopril  [lye-SIN-oh-pril] are\nrecommended as first-line treatment of hypertension in patients with a variety of compelling indications, including\nhigh coronary disease risk or history of diabetes, stroke, heart failure, myocardial infarction, or chronic kidney\ndisease (Figure 16.6).\n622\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 623 ---\n\nA.  Actions\nThe ACE inhibitors lower blood pressure by reducing peripheral vascular resistance without reflexively increasing\ncardiac output, heart rate, or contractility. These drugs block the enzyme ACE, which cleaves angiotensin I to form\nthe potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II (Figure 16.10). ACE is also responsible for the breakdown of bradykinin, a\npeptide that increases the production of nitric oxide and prostacyclin by the blood vessels. Both nitric oxide and\nprostacyclin are potent vasodilators. Vasodilation of both arterioles and veins occurs as a result of decreased\nvasoconstriction (from diminished levels of angiotensin II) and enhanced vasodilation (from increased bradykinin).\nBy reducing circulating angiotensin II levels, ACE inhibitors also decrease the secretion of aldosterone, resulting in\ndecreased sodium and water retention. ACE inhibitors reduce both cardiac preload and afterload, thereby decreasing\nworkload on the heart.\nFigure 16.10 Effects of various drug classes on the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone\nsystem. Blue = drug target enzymes; red = drug class.\n623\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 624 ---\n\nB.  Therapeutic uses\nACE inhibitors slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy and decrease albuminuria and, thus, have a compelling\nindication for use in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Beneficial effects on renal function may result from\ndecreasing intraglomerular pressures, due to efferent arteriolar vasodilation. ACE inhibitors are a standard in the\ncare of a patient following a myocardial infarction and first-line agents in the treatment of patients with systolic\ndysfunction. Chronic treatment with ACE inhibitors achieves sustained blood pressure reduction, regression of left\nventricular hypertrophy, and prevention of ventricular remodeling after a myocardial infarction. ACE inhibitors are\nfirst-line drugs for treating heart failure, hypertensive patients with chronic kidney disease, and patients at increased\nrisk of coronary artery disease. All of the ACE inhibitors are equally effective in the treatment of hypertension at\nequivalent doses.\n624\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 625 ---\n\nC.  Pharmacokinetics\nAll of the ACE inhibitors are orally bioavailable as a drug or prodrug. All but captopril  and lisinopril  undergo\nhepatic conversion to active metabolites, so these agents may be preferred in patients with severe hepatic\nimpairment. Fosinopril  [foe-SIN-oh-pril] is the only ACE inhibitor that is not eliminated primarily by the kidneys.\nTherefore, it does not require dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment. Enalaprilat  [en-AL-a-pril-AT] is\nthe only drug in this class available intravenously.\n625\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 626 ---\n\nD.  Adverse effects\nFigure 16.11 describes some of the common adverse effects of ACE inhibitors. The dry cough, which occurs in up\nto 10% of patients, is thought to be due to increased levels of bradykinin and substance P in the pulmonary tree, and\nit occurs more frequently in women. The cough resolves within a few days of discontinuation. Angioedema is a rare\nbut potentially life-threatening reaction that may also be due to increased levels of bradykinin. Potassium levels\nmust be monitored while on ACE inhibitors, and potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics should be\nused with caution due to the risk of hyperkalemia. Serum creatinine levels should also be monitored, particularly in\npatients with underlying renal disease. However, an increase in serum creatinine of up to 30% above baseline is\nacceptable and by itself does not warrant discontinuation of treatment. ACE inhibitors can induce fetal\nmalformations and should not be used by pregnant women.\n626\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 627 ---\n\nFigure 16.11 Some common adverse effects of the ACE inhibitors.\n627\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 628 ---\n\n628\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 629 ---\n\nVIII.  Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers\nThe ARBs, such as losartan [LOW-sar-tan] and irbesartan [ir-be-SAR-tan], block the AT1 receptors, decreasing the\nactivation of AT1 receptors by angiotensin II. Their pharmacologic effects are similar to those of ACE inhibitors in\nthat they produce arteriolar and venous dilation and block aldosterone secretion, thus lowering blood pressure and\ndecreasing salt and water retention (Figure 16.10). ARBs do not increase bradykinin levels. They may be used as\nfirst-line agents for the treatment of hypertension, especially in patients with a compelling indication of diabetes,\nheart failure, or chronic kidney disease (Figure 16.6). Adverse effects are similar to those of ACE inhibitors,\nalthough the risks of cough and angioedema are significantly decreased. ARBs should not be combined with an\nACE inhibitor for the treatment of hypertension due to similar mechanisms and adverse effects. These agents are\nalso teratogenic and should not be used by pregnant women. [Note: The ARBs are discussed more fully in Chapter\n18.]\n629\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 630 ---\n\nIX.  Renin Inhibitor\nA selective renin inhibitor, aliskiren [a-LIS-ke-rin], is available for the treatment of hypertension. Aliskiren directly\ninhibits renin and, thus, acts earlier in the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system than ACE inhibitors or ARBs\n(Figure 16.10). Aliskiren should not be combined with an ACE inhibitor or ARB in the treatment of hypertension.\nAliskiren can cause diarrhea, especially at higher doses. It also causes cough and angioedema but less often than\nACE inhibitors. As with ACE inhibitors and ARBs, aliskiren is contraindicated during pregnancy. Aliskiren is\nmetabolized by CYP3A4 and is subject to many drug interactions.\n630\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 631 ---\n\nX.  Calcium Channel Blockers\nCalcium channel blockers are a recommended first-line treatment option in black patients. They may also be useful\nin hypertensive patients with diabetes or stable ischemic heart disease. High doses of short-acting calcium channel\nblockers should be avoided because of increased risk of myocardial infarction due to excessive vasodilation and\nmarked reflex cardiac stimulation.\n631\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 632 ---\n\nA.  Classes of calcium channel blockers\nThe calcium channel blockers are divided into three chemical classes, each with different pharmacokinetic\nproperties and clinical indications (Figure 16.12).\nFigure 16.12 Actions of calcium channel blockers. AV = atrioventricular.\n1.  Diphenylalkylamines\nVerapamil  [ver-AP-a-mil] is the only member of this class that is available in the United States. Verapamil  has\nsignificant effects on both cardiac and vascular smooth muscle cells. It is also used to treat angina and\nsupraventricular tachyarrhythmias and to prevent migraine and cluster headaches.\n632\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 633 ---\n\n2.  Benzothiazepines\nDiltiazem [dil-TYE-a-zem] is the only member of this class that is currently approved in the United States. Like\nverapamil , diltiazem affects both cardiac and vascular smooth muscle cells, but it has a less pronounced negative\ninotropic effect on the heart compared to that of verapamil . Diltiazem has a favorable side effect profile.\n3.  Dihydropyridines\nThis class of calcium channel blockers includes nifedipine [nye-FED-i-peen] (the prototype), amlodipine [am-LOE-\ndi-peen], felodipine [fe-LOE-di-peen], isradipine [is-RAD-i-peen], nicardipine [nye-KAR-di-peen], and nisoldipine\n[nye-ZOL-di-peen]. These agents differ in pharmacokinetics, approved uses, and drug interactions. All\ndihydropyridines have a much greater affinity for vascular calcium channels than for calcium channels in the heart.\nThey are, therefore, particularly beneficial in treating hypertension. The dihydropyridines have the advantage in that\nthey show little interaction with other cardiovascular drugs, such as digoxin or warfarin, which are often used\nconcomitantly with calcium channel blockers.\n633\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 634 ---\n\nB.  Actions\nThe intracellular concentration of calcium plays an important role in maintaining the tone of smooth muscle and in\nthe contraction of the myocardium. Calcium channel antagonists block the inward movement of calcium by binding\nto L-type calcium channels in the heart and in smooth muscle of the coronary and peripheral arteriolar vasculature.\nThis causes vascular smooth muscle to relax, dilating mainly arterioles. Calcium channel blockers do not dilate\nveins.\n634\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 635 ---\n\nC.  Therapeutic uses\nIn the management of hypertension, CCBs may be used as an initial therapy or as add-on therapy. They are useful in\nthe treatment of hypertensive patients who also have asthma, diabetes, and/or peripheral vascular disease, because\nunlike β-blockers, they do not have the potential to adversely affect these conditions. All CCBs are useful in the\ntreatment of angina. In addition, diltiazem and verapamil  are used in the treatment of atrial fibrillation.\n635\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 636 ---\n\nD.  Pharmacokinetics\nMost of these agents have short half-lives (3 to 8 hours) following an oral dose. Sustained-release preparations are\navailable and permit once-daily dosing. Amlodipine has a very long half-life and does not require a sustained-release\nformulation.\n636\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 637 ---\n\nE.  Adverse effects\nFirst-degree atrioventricular block and constipation are common dose-dependent side effects of verapamil .\nVerapamil  and diltiazem should be avoided in patients with heart failure or with atrioventricular block due to their\nnegative inotropic (force of cardiac muscle contraction) and dromotropic (velocity of conduction) effects. Dizziness,\nheadache, and a feeling of fatigue caused by a decrease in blood pressure are more frequent with dihydropyridines\n(Figure 16.13). Peripheral edema is another commonly reported side effect of this class. Nifedipine and other\ndihydropyridines may cause gingival hyperplasia.\n637\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 638 ---\n\nFigure 16.13 Some common adverse effects of the calcium channel blockers.\n638\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 639 ---\n\n639\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 640 ---\n\nXI.  α-ADRENOCEPTOR–BLOCKING AGENTS\nα-Adrenergic blockers used in the treatment of hypertension include prazosin [PRA-zoe-sin], doxazosin [dox-AH-\nzoe-sin], and terazosin [ter-AH-zoe-sin]. These agents produce a competitive block of α1-adrenoceptors. They\ndecrease peripheral vascular resistance and lower arterial blood pressure by causing relaxation of both arterial and\nvenous smooth muscle. These drugs cause only minimal changes in cardiac output, renal blood flow, and glomerular\nfiltration rate. Therefore, long-term tachycardia does not occur, but salt and water retention does. Reflex tachycardia\nand postural hypotension often occur at the onset of treatment and with dose increases, requiring slow titration of the\ndrug in divided doses. Due to weaker outcome data and their side effect profile, α-blockers are no longer\nrecommended as initial treatment for hypertension but may be used for refractory cases. Other α1-blockers with\ngreater selectivity for the prostate are used in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (see",

Carvedilol  is indicated in the\ntreatment of heart failure and hypertension. It has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with\nheart failure. Labetalol  is used in the management of gestational hypertension and hypertensive emergencies.\n641\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 642 ---\n\nXIII.  Centrally Acting Adrenergic Drugs\n642\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 643 ---\n\nA.  Clonidine\nClonidine [KLON-i-deen] acts centrally as an α2 agonist to produce inhibition of sympathetic vasomotor centers,\ndecreasing sympathetic outflow to the periphery. This leads to reduced total peripheral resistance and decreased\nblood pressure. Clonidine is used primarily for the treatment of hypertension that has not responded adequately to\ntreatment with two or more drugs. Clonidine does not decrease renal blood flow or glomerular filtration and,\ntherefore, is useful in the treatment of hypertension complicated by renal disease. Clonidine is well absorbed after\noral administration and is excreted by the kidney. It is also available in a transdermal patch. Adverse effects include\nsedation, dry mouth, and constipation (Figure 16.14). Rebound hypertension occurs following abrupt withdrawal of\nclonidine. The drug should, therefore, be withdrawn slowly if discontinuation is required.\n643\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 644 ---\n\nFigure 16.14 Some adverse effects of clonidine.\n644\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 645 ---\n\n645\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 646 ---\n\nB.  Methyldopa\nMethyldopa [meth-ill-DOE-pa] is an α2 agonist that is converted to methylnorepinephrine centrally to diminish\nadrenergic outflow from the CNS. The most common side effects of methyldopa are sedation and drowsiness. Its use\nis limited due to adverse effects and the need for multiple daily doses. It is mainly used for management of\nhypertension in pregnancy, where it has a record of safety.\n646\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 647 ---\n\nXIV.  Vasodilators\nThe direct-acting smooth muscle relaxants, such as hydralazine [hye-DRAL-a-zeen] and minoxidil  [min-OX-i-dill],\nare not used as primary drugs to treat hypertension. These vasodilators act by producing relaxation of vascular\nsmooth muscle, primarily in arteries and arterioles. This results in decreased peripheral resistance and, therefore,\nblood pressure. Both agents produce reflex stimulation of the heart, resulting in the competing reflexes of increased\nmyocardial contractility, heart rate, and oxygen consumption. These actions may prompt angina pectoris, myocardial\ninfarction, or cardiac failure in predisposed individuals. Vasodilators also increase plasma renin concentration,\nresulting in sodium and water retention. These undesirable side effects can be blocked by concomitant use of a\ndiuretic (to decrease sodium retention) and a β-blocker (to balance the reflex tachycardia). Together, the three drugs\ndecrease cardiac output, plasma volume, and peripheral vascular resistance. Hydralazine is an accepted medication\nfor controlling blood pressure in pregnancy-induced hypertension. Adverse effects of hydralazine include headache,\ntachycardia, nausea, sweating, arrhythmia, and precipitation of angina (Figure 16.15). A lupus-like syndrome can\noccur with high dosages, but it is reversible upon discontinuation of the drug. Minoxidil  treatment causes\nhypertrichosis (the growth of body hair). This drug is used topically to treat male pattern baldness.\n647\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 648 ---\n\nFigure 16.15 Some adverse effects of hydralazine.\n648\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 649 ---\n\n649\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 650 ---\n\nXV.  Hypertensive Emergency\nHypertensive emergency is a rare but life-threatening situation characterized by severe elevations in blood pressure\n(systolic greater than 180 mm Hg or diastolic greater than 120 mm Hg) with evidence of impending or progressive\ntarget organ damage (for example, stroke, myocardial infarction). [Note: A severe elevation in blood pressure\nwithout evidence of target organ damage is considered a hypertensive urgency.] Hypertensive emergencies require\ntimely blood pressure reduction with treatment administered intravenously to prevent or limit target organ damage.\nA variety of medications are used, including calcium channel blockers (nicardipine and clevidipine), nitric oxide\nvasodilators (nitroprusside and nitroglycerin), adrenergic receptor antagonists (phentolamine, esmolol , and\nlabetalol ), the vasodilator hydralazine, and the dopamine agonist fenoldopam. Treatment is directed by the type of\ntarget organ damage and/or comorbidities present.\n650\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 651 ---\n\nXVI.  Resistant Hypertension\nResistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure that remains elevated (above goal) despite administration of an\noptimal three-drug regimen that includes a diuretic. The most common causes of resistant hypertension are poor\ncompliance, excessive ethanol intake, concomitant conditions (diabetes, obesity, sleep apnea, hyperaldosteronism,\nhigh salt intake, and/or metabolic syndrome), concomitant medications (sympathomimetics, nonsteroidal anti-\ninflammatory drugs, or corticosteroids), insufficient dose and/or drugs, and use of drugs with similar mechanisms of\naction.\n651\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 652 ---\n\n16.1\n16.2\n16.3\n16.4\n16.5\n16.6Study Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nA 55-year-old non-Hispanic black male has hypertension. His past medical history also includes diabetes and\nhyperlipidemia. According to the ACC/AHA guidelines, which among the choices represents the most\nappropriate blood pressure goal for the patient?\nA.  Less than 140/85\nB.  Less than 135/85\nC.  Less than 130/80\nD.  Less than 140/80\nCorrect answer = C. Goals of therapy differ depending on which guidelines the clinician uses in practice.\nAccording to the ACC/AHA guidelines the goal blood pressure for a diabetic patient is less than 130/80.\nA 59-year-old non-Hispanic white patient presents for treatment of hypertension. His past medical history\nalso includes diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. The patient’s blood pressure is 150/93 (both today\nand at the last visit). Which is a recommended initial therapy to treat hypertension in this patient?\nA.  Enalapril\nB.  Hydralazine\nC.  Verapamil\nD.  Metoprolol\nCorrect answer = A. Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor and is recommended for first-line therapy in various patient\npopulations, including those who have a compelling indication such as diabetes. The other therapies are not\nconsidered first-line therapy.\nA 45-year-old male complains of constipation. He was recently started on two antihypertensives due to\nelevated systolic blood pressure (greater than 20 mm Hg above goal). His current medications include\nlisinopril, chlorthalidone, verapamil, rosuvastatin, and aspirin. Which is most likely contributing to his\nconstipation?\nA.  Chlorthalidone\nB.  Verapamil\nC.  Aspirin\nD.  Lisinopril\nCorrect answer = B. Common side effects specific for verapamil include constipation and first-degree\natrioventricular block, which typically are dose-dependent. Electrolyte disturbances are often associated with both\ndiuretics (chlorthalidone) and ACE inhibitors (lisinopril).\nWhich antihypertensive medication can cause the rare side effect of angioedema?\nA.  Amlodipine\nB.  Fosinopril\nC.  Prazosin\nD.  Propranolol\nCorrect answer = B. ACE inhibitors (fosinopril), ARBs (for example, losartan), and renin inhibitors (aliskiren)\ncan cause angioedema. The occurrence of angioedema is more common with ACE inhibitors. Amlodipine can\ncause dizziness, headache, and peripheral edema. Prazosin can cause reflex tachycardia and postural hypotension.\nPropranolol can cause insomnia, decreased libido, fatigue, and bradycardia.\nA 52-year-old female has uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure 154/82 mm Hg) on treatment with\nlisinopril. She recently had a myocardial infarction and her past medical history includes diabetes,\nhypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis. Considering her compelling indications, which agent may\nbe appropriate to add to her antihypertensive therapy?\nA.  Clonidine\nB.  Olmesartan\nC.  Furosemide\nD.  Metoprolol\nCorrect answer = D. Individual patient care is warranted particularly in the case of a compelling indication for\ncertain medication. Considering her recent myocardial infarction, the best choice is a β1-blocker (metoprolol). It\nis not appropriate to combine an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) and ARB (olmesartan). The other agents are not\nconsidered first-line therapy and do not have a compelling indication for addition to the regimen.\nThe blood pressure of a patient with essential hypertension is at goal on treatment with enalapril. Since\ninitiation of enalapril, the serum creatinine has increased 25% above baseline. What is the appropriate next\nstep for the enalapril therapy?652\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 653 ---\n\n16.7\n16.8\n16.9\n16.10A.  Discontinue enalapril.\nB.  Reduce dose of enalapril.\nC.  Continue current dose of enalapril.\nD.  Increase dose of enalapril.\nCorrect answer = C. The blood pressure is at goal. Electrolytes (such as potassium) and serum creatinine should\nbe monitored in patients who initiate ACE inhibitors. Increases in serum creatinine up to 30% above baseline are\nacceptable and do not warrant discontinuation or reduction of treatment. Since the blood pressure is at goal,\nincreasing the enalapril is not necessary.\nWhich of the following correctly outlines a major difference in electrolyte disturbances associated with\nthiazide and loop diuretics?\nA.  Thiazide diuretics decrease potassium and loop diuretics increase potassium.\nB.  Thiazide diuretics increase potassium and loop diuretics decrease potassium.\nC.  Thiazide diuretics decrease calcium and loop diuretics increase calcium.\nD.  Thiazide diuretics increase calcium and loop diuretics decrease calcium.\nCorrect answer = D. Thiazide and loop diuretics decrease potassium, sodium and magnesium. However, thiazide\ndiuretics increase calcium (through reduced urinary excretion), while loop diuretics reduce calcium (through\nenhanced urinary excretion).\nWhich can precipitate a hypertensive crisis following abrupt cessation of therapy?\nA.  Clonidine\nB.  Diltiazem\nC.  Valsartan\nD.  Hydrochlorothiazide\nCorrect answer = A. Increased sympathetic nervous system activity occurs if clonidine therapy is abruptly\nstopped after prolonged administration. Uncontrolled elevation of blood pressure can occur. Patients should be\nslowly weaned from clonidine while other antihypertensive medications are initiated. The other drugs on the list\ndo not produce this phenomenon.\nWhich of the following is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker?\nA.  Amlodipine\nB.  Metoprolol\nC.  Verapamil\nD.  Lisinopril\nCorrect answer = A. There are three classes of calcium channel blockers: nondihydropyridines (benzothiazepines,\ndiphenylalkylamines) and dihydropyridines. Amlodipine is a member of the dihydropyridine class of calcium\nchannel blockers, which also includes nifedipine and felodipine. Verapamil is a benzothiazepine calcium channel\nblocker, metoprolol is a β-blocker, and lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor.\nA 45-year-old man was started on therapy for hypertension and developed a persistent, dry cough. Which is\nmost likely responsible for this side effect?\nA.  Lisinopril\nB.  Losartan\nC.  Nifedipine\nD.  Atenolol\nCorrect answer = A. The cough is most likely an adverse effect of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril. Losartan is an\nARB that has the same beneficial effects as an ACE inhibitor but is less likely to produce a cough. Nifedipine and\natenolol do not cause this side effect.653\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 654 ---\n\n17\nDiuretics\nZachary L. Cox\n654\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 655 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nDiuretics are drugs that increase the volume of urine excreted. Most diuretic agents are inhibitors of renal ion\ntransporters that decrease the reabsorption of Na+ at different sites in the nephron. As a result, Na+ and other ions\nenter the urine in greater than normal amounts along with water, which is carried passively to maintain osmotic\nequilibrium. Diuretics, thus, increase the volume of urine and often change its pH, as well as the ionic composition\nof the urine and blood. The diuretic effect of the different classes of diuretics varies considerably with the site of\naction. In addition to the ion transport inhibitors, other types of diuretics include osmotic diuretics, aldosterone\nantagonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. While diuretics are most commonly used for management of\nexcessive fluid retention (edema), many agents within this class are prescribed for non-diuretic indications or for\nsystemic effects in addition to their actions on the kidney. Examples, which are discussed below, include use of\nthiazides in hypertension, use of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in glaucoma, and use of aldosterone antagonists in\nheart failure. In this chapter, the diuretic drugs (Figure 17.1) are discussed according to the frequency of their use.\nFigure 17.1 Summary of diuretic drugs.\n655\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 656 ---\n\nII.  Normal Regulation of Fluid and Electrolytes by the Kidneys\nApproximately 16% to 20% of the blood plasma entering the kidneys is filtered from the glomerular capillaries into\nBowman's capsule. The filtrate, although normally free of proteins and blood cells, contains most of the low\nmolecular weight plasma components in concentrations similar to that in the plasma. These include glucose, sodium\nbicarbonate, amino acids, and other organic solutes, as well as electrolytes, such as Na+, K+, and Cl−. The kidney\nregulates the ionic composition and volume of urine by active reabsorption or secretion of ions and/or passive\nreabsorption of water at five functional zones along the nephron: 1) the proximal convoluted tubule, 2) the\ndescending loop of Henle, 3) the ascending loop of Henle, 4) the distal convoluted tubule, and 5) the collecting\ntubule and duct (Figure 17.2).\nFigure 17.2 Major locations of ion and water exchange in the nephron, showing sites of\naction of the diuretic drugs.\n656\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 657 ---\n\nA.  Proximal convoluted tubule\nIn the proximal convoluted tubule located in the cortex of the kidney, almost all the glucose, bicarbonate, amino\nacids, and other metabolites are reabsorbed (Figure 17.3). Approximately 65% of the filtered Na+ (and water) is\nreabsorbed. Given the high water permeability, about 60% of water is reabsorbed from the lumen to the blood to\nmaintain osmolar equality. Chloride enters the lumen of the tubule in exchange for an anion, such as oxalate, as well\nas paracellularly through the lumen. The Na+ that is reabsorbed is pumped into the interstitium by the Na+/K+-\nadenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) pump. Carbonic anhydrase in the luminal membrane and cytoplasm of the\nproximal tubular cells modulates the reabsorption of bicarbonate. Despite having the highest percentage of filtered\nNa+ that is reabsorbed, diuretics working in the proximal convoluted tubule display weak diuretic properties. The\npresence of a high capacity Na+ and water reabsorption area (loop of Henle) distal to the proximal convoluted tubule\nallows reabsorption of Na+ and water kept in the lumen by diuretics acting in the proximal convoluted tubule, and\nlimits effective diuresis.\nFigure 17.3 Proximal convoluted tubule cell.\nThe proximal tubule is the site of the organic acid and base secretory systems. The organic acid secretory system,\nlocated in the middle-third of the proximal tubule, secretes a variety of organic acids, such as uric acid, some\nantibiotics, and diuretics, from the bloodstream into the proximal tubular lumen. The organic acid secretory system\nis saturable, and diuretic drugs in the bloodstream compete for transfer with endogenous organic acids such as uric\nacid. A number of other interactions can also occur. For example, probenecid interferes with penicillin secretion.\nThe organic base secretory system, located in the upper and middle segments of the proximal tubule, is responsible\nfor the secretion of creatinine and choline.\n657\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 658 ---\n\nB.  Descending loop of Henle\nThe remaining filtrate, which is isotonic, next enters the descending limb of the loop of Henle and passes into the\nmedulla of the kidney. The osmolarity increases along the descending portion of the loop of Henle because of the\ncountercurrent mechanism that is responsible for water reabsorption. This results in a tubular fluid with a three-fold\nincrease in Na+ and Cl− concentration. Osmotic diuretics exert part of their action in this region.\n658\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 659 ---\n\nC.  Ascending loop of Henle\nThe cells of the ascending tubular epithelium are unique in being impermeable to water. Active reabsorption of Na+,\nK+, and Cl− is mediated by a Na+/K+/2Cl− cotransporter (Figure 17.4). Both Mg2+ and Ca2+ are reabsorbed via the\nparacellular pathway. Thus, the ascending loop dilutes the tubular fluid and raises the osmolarity of the medullary\ninterstitium. Approximately 25% to 30% of the filtered sodium chloride is absorbed here. Because the ascending\nloop of Henle is a major site for salt reabsorption and no segments distally are capable of significant Na+ and water\nreabsorption, drugs affecting this site, such as loop diuretics, have the greatest diuretic effect.\nFigure 17.4 Ascending loop of Henle cell.\n659\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 660 ---\n\nD.  Distal convoluted tubule\nThe cells of the distal convoluted tubule are also impermeable to water. About 5% to 10% of the filtered sodium\nchloride is reabsorbed via a Na+/Cl− transporter, the target of thiazide diuretics. Calcium reabsorption, under the\nregulation of parathyroid hormone, is mediated by an apical channel and then transported by a Na+/Ca2+-exchanger\ninto the interstitial fluid (Figure 17.5).\nFigure 17.5 Distal convoluted tubule cell.\n660\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 661 ---\n\nE.  Collecting tubule and duct\nThe principal cells of the collecting tubule and duct are responsible for Na+, K+, and water transport, whereas the\nintercalated cells affect H+ secretion (Figure 17.6). Approximately 1% to 2% of the filtered sodium enters the\nprincipal cells through epithelial sodium channels that are inhibited by amiloride and triamterene. Once inside the\ncell, Na+ reabsorption relies on a Na+/K+-ATPase pump to be transported into the blood. Aldosterone receptors in\nthe principal cells influence Na+ reabsorption and K+ secretion. Aldosterone increases the synthesis of epithelial\nsodium channels and of the Na+/K+-ATPase pump to increase Na+ reabsorption and K+ excretion. Antidiuretic\nhormone (ADH; vasopressin) binds to V2 receptors to promote the reabsorption of water through aquaporin\nchannels.\nFigure 17.6 Collecting tubule and duct cells. E Na channel = Epithelial sodium channel.\n661\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 662 ---\n\nIII.  Thiazides\nThe thiazides are the most widely used diuretics because of their antihypertensive effects. However, the efficacy of\nthiazides for hypertension is not entirely dependent on their diuretic actions. These agents also reduce peripheral\nvascular resistance with long-term therapy. Despite being sulfonamide derivatives, thiazides do not generally cause\nhypersensitivity reactions in patients with allergies to sulfonamide antimicrobials such as sulfamethoxazole. All\nthiazides affect the distal convoluted tubule (Figure 17.2), and all have equal maximum diuretic effects, differing\nonly in potency. Thiazides are sometimes called “low ceiling diuretics,” because increasing the dose above normal\ntherapeutic doses does not promote further diuretic response.\n662\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 663 ---\n\nA.  Thiazides\nChlorothiazide [klor-oh-THYE-ah-zide] was the first orally active thiazide, although hydrochlorothiazide [hye-dro-\nklor-oh-THYE-ah-zide] and chlorthalidone [klor-THAL-i-done] are now used more commonly due to better\nbioavailability. Hydrochlorothiazide is more potent, so the required dose is considerably lower than that of\nchlorothiazide, but the efficacy is comparable to that of the parent drug. In all other aspects, hydrochlorothiazide\nresembles chlorothiazide. Chlorthalidone is approximately twice as potent as hydrochlorothiazide. Chlorthalidone,\nindapamide [in-DAP-a-mide], and metolazone [me-TOL-ah-zone] are referred to as thiazide-like diuretics because\nthey lack the characteristic benzothiadiazine chemical structure; however, their mechanism of action, indications,\nand adverse effects are similar to those of hydrochlorothiazide.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nThe thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics act mainly in the distal convoluted tubule to decrease the reabsorption of Na+\nby inhibition of a Na+/Cl− cotransporter (Figure 17.5). As a result, these drugs increase the concentration of Na+ and\nCl− in the tubular fluid. Thiazides must be excreted into the tubular lumen at the proximal convoluted tubule to be\neffective (Figure 17.3). Therefore, decreasing renal function reduces the diuretic effects. The antihypertensive\neffects of thiazides may persist even when the glomerular filtration rate is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. However,\nhypertension at this level of renal dysfunction is often exacerbated by hypervolemia, requiring a change to loop\ndiuretics for volume status and, therefore, blood pressure control. The efficacy of thiazides may be diminished with\nconcomitant use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as indomethacin, which inhibit production\nof renal prostaglandins, thereby reducing renal blood flow.\n2.  Actions\na.  Increased excretion of Na+ and Cl−\nThiazide and thiazide-like diuretics cause diuresis with increased Na+ and Cl− excretion, which can result in the\nexcretion of very hyperosmolar (concentrated) urine. This latter effect is unique, as the other diuretic classes are\nunlikely to produce a hyperosmolar urine. Figure 17.7 outlines relative changes in the ionic composition of the urine\nwith thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics.\nFigure 17.7 Urinary excretion from diuretic therapy.\nb.  Decreased urinary calcium excretion\nThiazide and thiazide-like diuretics decrease the Ca2+ content of urine by promoting the reabsorption of Ca2+ in the\ndistal convoluted tubule where parathyroid hormone regulates reabsorption.\nc.  Reduced peripheral vascular resistance\nAn initial reduction in blood pressure results from a decrease in blood volume and, therefore, a decrease in cardiac\noutput. With continued therapy, blood volume returns to baseline. However, antihypertensive effects continue,\nresulting from reduced peripheral vascular resistance caused by relaxation of arteriolar smooth muscle.\n3.  Therapeutic uses\na.  Hypertension\nClinically, thiazides are a mainstay of antihypertensive treatment, because they are inexpensive, convenient to\n663\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 664 ---\n\nadminister, and well tolerated. Blood pressure can be lowered with a daily dose of thiazide. At doses equipotent to\nhydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone is considered a preferred option by some clinicians because of its longer half-\nlife (50 to 60 hours) and improved control of blood pressure over the entire day. However, current treatment\nguidelines for hypertension do not recommend any thiazide preferentially.\nb.  Heart failure\nLoop diuretics (not thiazides) are the diuretics of choice in reducing extracellular volume in heart failure. However,\nthiazide diuretics may be added in patients resistant to loop diuretics, with careful monitoring for hypokalemia.\nMetolazone is most frequently utilized as an addition to loop diuretics, although there is a lack of evidence that it is\nmore effective than other thiazides for this indication when administered at equipotent doses. Historically, thiazides\nwere prescribed to be administered 30 minutes prior to loop diuretics to allow the thiazide time to reach the site of\naction when combined to augment diuresis in diuretic resistance. This practice is unnecessary and not supported by\ncurrent evidence.\nc.  Hypercalciuria\nThe thiazides can be useful in treating idiopathic hypercalciuria and calcium oxalate stones in the urinary tract,\nbecause they inhibit urinary Ca2+ excretion.\nd.  Diabetes insipidus\nThiazides have the unique ability to produce a hyperosmolar urine. Thiazides can be utilized as a treatment for\nnephrogenic diabetes insipidus. The urine volume of such individuals may drop from 11 to about 3 L/d when treated\nwith thiazides.\n4.  Pharmacokinetics\nAs a class, thiazides are effective orally, with a bioavailability of 60% to 70%. Chlorothiazide has a much lower\nbioavailability (15% to 30%) and is the only thiazide with an intravenous dosage form. Most thiazides take 1 to 3\nweeks to produce a stable reduction in blood pressure and exhibit a prolonged half-life (approximately 10 to 15\nhours). Indapamide differs from the class because it undergoes hepatic metabolism and is excreted in both the urine\nand bile. Most thiazides are primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.\n5.  Adverse effects\nThese mainly involve problems in fluid and electrolyte balance (Figure 17.8).\n664\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 665 ---\n\nFigure 17.8 Summary of adverse effects commonly observed with thiazide and thiazide-\nlike medications.\na.  Hypokalemia\n665\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 666 ---\n\nHypokalemia is the most frequent problem with the thiazide diuretics. Because thiazides increase Na+ in the filtrate\narriving at the distal tubule, more K+ is also exchanged for Na+, resulting in a continual loss of K+ from the body\nwith prolonged use of these drugs Thus, serum K+ should be measured periodically (more frequently at the\nbeginning of therapy) to monitor for the development of hypokalemia. Potassium supplementation or combination\nwith a potassium-sparing diuretic may be required. Low-sodium diets blunt the potassium depletion caused by\nthiazide diuretics.\nb.  Hypomagnesemia\nUrinary loss of magnesium can lead to hypomagnesemia.\nc.  Hyponatremia\nHyponatremia may develop due to elevation of ADH, as well as diminished diluting capacity of the kidney and\nincreased thirst.\nd.  Hyperuricemia\nThiazides increase serum uric acid by decreasing the amount of acid excreted through competition in the organic\nacid secretory system. Being insoluble, uric acid deposits in the joints and may precipitate a gouty attack in\npredisposed individuals. Therefore, thiazides should be used with caution in patients with gout or high levels of uric\nacid.\ne.  Hypovolemia\nThis can cause orthostatic hypotension or light-headedness.\nf.  Hypercalcemia\nThiazides inhibit the secretion of Ca2+, sometimes leading to hypercalcemia (elevated levels of Ca2+ in the blood).\ng.  Hyperglycemia\nTherapy with thiazides can lead to mild elevations in serum glucose, possibly due to impaired release of insulin\nrelated to hypokalemia. Patients with diabetes still benefit from thiazide therapy, but should monitor glucose to\nassess the need for an adjustment in diabetes therapy if thiazides are initiated.\n666\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 667 ---\n\nIV.  Loop Diuretics\nBumetanide [byoo-MET-ah-nide], furosemide [fur-OH-se-mide], torsemide [TOR-se-mide], and ethacrynic [eth-a-\nKRIN-ik] acid have their major diuretic action on the ascending limb of the loop of Henle (Figure 17.2). Of all the\ndiuretics, these drugs have the highest efficacy in mobilizing Na+ and Cl− from the body, producing copious\namounts of urine. Similar to thiazides, loop diuretics do not generally cause hypersensitivity reactions in patients\nwith allergies to sulfonamide antimicrobials such as sulfamethoxazole because of structural differences in their\nsulfonamide derivative. Furosemide is the most commonly used of these drugs. The use of bumetanide and\ntorsemide is increasing, as these agents have better bioavailability and are more potent compared to furosemide.\nEthacrynic acid is used infrequently due to its adverse effect profile.\n667\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 668 ---\n\nA.  Bumetanide, furosemide, torsemide, and ethacrynic acid\n1.  Mechanism of action\nLoop diuretics inhibit the cotransport of Na+/K+/2Cl− in the luminal membrane in the ascending limb of the loop of\nHenle (Figure 17.4). Therefore, reabsorption of these ions into the renal medulla is decreased. By lowering the\nosmotic pressure in the medulla, less water is reabsorbed from water permeable segments, like the descending loop\nof Henle, causing diuresis. These agents have the greatest diuretic effect of all the diuretics because the ascending\nlimb accounts for reabsorption of 25% to 30% of filtered NaCl and downstream sites are unable to compensate for\nthe increased Na+ load. Loop diuretics must be excreted into the tubular lumen at the proximal convoluted tubule to\nbe effective (Figure 17.3). NSAIDs inhibit renal prostaglandin synthesis and can reduce the diuretic action of loop\ndiuretics.\n2.  Actions\na.  Diuresis\nLoop diuretics cause diuresis, even in patients with poor renal function or lack of response to other diuretics.\nChanges in the composition of the urine induced by loop diuretics are shown in Figure 17.7.\nLoop diuretics display a sigmoidal (“S”-shaped) dose-response curve with three parts: a threshold effect, a rapid\nincrease in diuresis with small changes in drug concentration, and a ceiling effect ( Figure 17.9). A dose must be\nselected to cross the response threshold, which is patient-specific. Reducing the effective dose with the intent of a\nreduction in diuresis can result in no diuresis, if the concentration of loop diuretic drops below the response\nthreshold. Likewise, increasing the effective dose may not cause more diuresis because of the ceiling effect. Thus,\nafter determination of an effective diuretic dose, the clinician should modify the frequency of administration to\nincrease or decrease the daily diuresis.\nFigure 17.9 Loop diuretic dose-response curve.\nb.  Increased urinary calcium excretion\nUnlike thiazides, loop diuretics increase the Ca2+ content of urine. In patients with normal serum Ca2+\nconcentrations, hypocalcemia does not result, because Ca2+ is reabsorbed in the distal convoluted tubule.\nc.  Venodilation\nPrior to their diuretic actions, loop diuretics cause acute venodilation and reduce left ventricular filling pressures via\nenhanced prostaglandin synthesis.\n3.  Therapeutic uses\na.  Edema\nLoop diuretics are the drugs of choice for treatment of pulmonary edema and acute/chronic peripheral edema caused\nfrom heart failure or renal impairment. Because of their rapid onset of action, particularly when given intravenously,\n668\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 669 ---\n\nthe drugs are useful in emergency situations such as acute pulmonary edema.\nb.  Hypercalcemia\nLoop diuretics (along with hydration) are also useful in treating hypercalcemia, because they stimulate tubular Ca2+\nexcretion.\nc.  Hyperkalemia\nLoop diuretics can be used with or without replacement intravenous fluid for the treatment of hyperkalemia.\n4.  Pharmacokinetics\nLoop diuretics are administered orally or parenterally. Furosemide has unpredictable bioavailability of 10% to 90%\nafter oral administration. Bumetanide and torsemide have reliable bioavailability of 80% to 100%, which makes\nthese agents preferred for oral therapy. The duration of action is approximately 6 hours for furosemide and\nbumetanide, and moderately longer for torsemide, allowing patients to predict the window of diuresis.\n5.  Effects\nFluid and electrolyte issues are the predominant adverse effects (Figure 17.10).\n669\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 670 ---\n\nFigure 17.10 Summary of adverse effects commonly observed with loop diuretics.\na.  Acute hypovolemia\n670\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 671 ---\n\nLoop diuretics can cause a severe and rapid reduction in blood volume, with the possibility of hypotension, shock,\nand cardiac arrhythmias.\nb.  Hypokalemia\nThe heavy load of Na+ presented to the collecting tubule results in increased exchange of tubular Na+ for K+, leading\nto hypokalemia, the most common adverse effect of the loop diuretics. The loss of K+ from cells in exchange for H+\nleads to hypokalemic alkalosis. Use of potassium-sparing diuretics or supplementation with K+ can prevent the\ndevelopment of hypokalemia.\nc.  Hypomagnesemia\nUrinary loss of magnesium can lead to hypomagnesemia.\nd.  Ototoxicity\nReversible or permanent hearing loss may occur with loop diuretics, particularly when infused intravenously at fast\nrates, at high doses, or when used in conjunction with other ototoxic drugs (for example, aminoglycoside\nantibiotics). With current dosing and appropriate infusion rates, ototoxicity is a rare occurrence. Ethacrynic acid is\nthe most likely to cause ototoxicity. Although less common, vestibular function may also be affected, inducing\nvertigo.\ne.  Hyperuricemia\nLoop diuretics compete with uric acid for the renal secretory systems, thus blocking its secretion and, in turn, may\ncause or exacerbate gouty attacks.\n671\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 672 ---\n\nV.  Potassium-Sparing Diuretics\nPotassium-sparing diuretics act in the collecting tubule to inhibit Na+ reabsorption and K+ excretion (Figure 17.6).\nPotassium levels must be monitored in patients treated with potassium-sparing diuretics. These drugs should be used\ncautiously in moderate renal dysfunction and avoided in patients with severe renal dysfunction because of the\nincreased risk of hyperkalemia. Within this class, there are drugs with two distinct mechanisms of action with\ndifferent indications for use: aldosterone antagonists and epithelial sodium channel blockers. Changes in the\ncomposition of the urine induced by potassium-sparing diuretics are shown in Figure 17.7.\n672\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 673 ---\n\nA.  Aldosterone antagonists: spironolactone and eplerenone\n1.  Mechanism of action\nSpironolactone [spear-oh-no-LAK-tone] and eplerenone [eh-PLEH-reh-none] are synthetic steroids that antagonize\naldosterone receptors. This prevents translocation of the receptor complex into the nucleus of the target cell,\nultimately resulting in a lack of intracellular proteins that stimulate the Na+/K+-exchange sites of the collecting\ntubule. Thus, aldosterone antagonists prevent Na+ reabsorption and, therefore, K+ and H+ secretion. Eplerenone is\nmore selective for aldosterone receptors and causes less endocrine effects (gynecomastia) than spironolactone,\nwhich also binds to progesterone and androgen receptors.\n2.  Actions\nSpironolactone and eplerenone antagonize aldosterone receptors at renal sites, which causes diuresis, and nonrenal\nsites, which causes other effects. In most edematous states, blood levels of aldosterone are high, causing retention of\nNa+. Spironolactone antagonizes the activity of aldosterone, resulting in retention of K+ and excretion of Na+.\n3.  Therapeutic uses\na.  Edema\nAldosterone antagonists are particularly effective diuretics when used in high doses for edema associated with\nsecondary hyperaldosteronism, such as hepatic cirrhosis and nephrotic syndrome. Spironolactone is the diuretic of\nchoice in patients with hepatic cirrhosis with fluid in the peritoneal cavity (ascites). By contrast, in patients who\nhave no significant circulating levels of aldosterone, there is minimal diuretic effect with use of this drug.\nb.  Hypokalemia\nAlthough the aldosterone antagonists have a low efficacy in mobilizing Na+ from the body in comparison with the\nother diuretics, they have the useful property of causing the retention of K+. These agents are often given in\nconjunction with thiazide or loop diuretics to prevent K+ excretion that occurs with those diuretics.\nc.  Heart failure\nAldosterone antagonists are employed at lower doses to prevent myocardial remodeling mediated by aldosterone.\nUse of these agents has been shown to decrease mortality associated with heart failure, particularly in those with\nreduced ejection fraction.\nd.  Resistant hypertension\nResistant hypertension, defined by the use of three or more medications without reaching the blood pressure goal,\noften responds well to aldosterone antagonists. This effect can be seen in those with or without elevated aldosterone\nlevels.\ne.  Polycystic ovary syndrome\nSpironolactone is often used off-label for the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome. It blocks androgen receptors\nand inhibits steroid synthesis at high doses, thereby helping to offset increased androgen levels seen in this disorder.\n4.  Pharmacokinetics\nBoth spironolactone and eplerenone are well absorbed after oral administration. S pironolactone is extensively\nmetabolized and converted to several active metabolites, which contribute to the therapeutic effects. Eplerenone is\nmetabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4.\n5.  Adverse effects\na.  Hyperkalemia\nThe most common side effect, hyperkalemia, is dose-dependent and increases with renal dysfunction or use of other\npotassium-sparing agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and potassium supplements.\nb.  Gynecomastia\nSpironolactone, but not eplerenone, may induce gynecomastia in approximately 10% of male patients and menstrual\nirregularities in female patients.\n673\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 674 ---\n\nB.  Triamterene and amiloride\nTriamterene [trye-AM-ter-een] and amiloride [a-MIL-oh-ride] block epithelial sodium channels, resulting in a\ndecrease in Na+/K+ exchange. Although they have a K+-sparing diuretic action similar to that of the aldosterone\nantagonists, their ability to block the Na+/K+-exchange site in the collecting tubule does not depend on the presence\nof aldosterone. Like the aldosterone antagonists, these agents are not very efficacious diuretics. Both triamterene\nand amiloride are commonly used in combination with other diuretics, almost solely for their potassium-sparing\nproperties.\n674\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 675 ---\n\nVI.  Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitor\nAcetazolamide [ah-set-a-ZOLE-a-mide] and other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are more often used for their other\npharmacologic actions than for their diuretic effect, because they are much less efficacious than the thiazide or loop\ndiuretics.\n675\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 676 ---\n\nA.  Acetazolamide\n1.  Mechanism of action\nAcetazolamide inhibits carbonic anhydrase located intracellularly (cytoplasm) and on the apical membrane of the\nproximal tubular epithelium (Figure 17.3). [Note: Carbonic anhydrase catalyzes the reaction of CO2 and H2O,\nleading to H2CO3, which spontaneously ionizes to H+ and HCO3− (bicarbonate).] The decreased ability to exchange\nNa+ for H+ in the presence of acetazolamide results in a mild diuresis. Additionally, HCO3− is retained in the lumen,\nwith marked elevation in urinary pH. The loss of HCO3− causes a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Changes in\nthe composition of urinary electrolytes induced by acetazolamide are summarized in Figure 17.7.\n2.  Therapeutic uses\na.  Glaucoma\nOral acetazolamide decreases the production of aqueous humor and reduces intraocular pressure in patients with\nchronic open-angle glaucoma, probably by blocking carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary body of the eye. Topical\ncarbonic anhydrase inhibitors, such as dorzolamide and brinzolamide, have the advantage of not causing systemic\neffects.\nb.  Altitude sickness\nAcetazolamide can be used in the prophylaxis of symptoms of altitude sickness. Acetazolamide prevents weakness,\nbreathlessness, dizziness, nausea, and cerebral as well as pulmonary edema characteristic of the syndrome.\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\nAcetazolamide can be administered orally or intravenously. It is approximately 90% protein bound and eliminated\nrenally by both active tubular secretion and passive reabsorption.\n4.  Adverse effects\nMetabolic acidosis (mild), potassium depletion, renal stone formation, drowsiness, and paresthesia may occur. The\ndrug should be avoided in patients with hepatic cirrhosis, because it could lead to a decreased excretion of NH4+.\n676\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 677 ---\n\nVII.  Osmotic Diuretics\nA number of simple, hydrophilic chemical substances that are filtered through the glomerulus, such as mannitol\n[MAN-i-tol], result in diuresis (Figure 17.2). Filtered substances that undergo little or no reabsorption result in a\nhigher osmolarity of the tubular fluid. This prevents further water reabsorption at the descending loop of Henle and\nproximal convoluted tubule, resulting in osmotic diuresis with little additional Na+ excretion (aquaresis). Therefore,\nthese agents are not useful for treating conditions in which Na+ retention occurs. They are used to maintain urine\nflow following acute toxic ingestion of substances capable of producing acute renal failure. Osmotic diuretics are a\nmainstay of treatment for patients with increased intracranial pressure. [Note: Mannitol  is not absorbed when given\norally and should be given intravenously.] Adverse effects include dehydration and extracellular water expansion\nfrom the osmotic effects in the systemic circulation. The expansion of extracellular water occurs because the\npresence of mannitol  in the extracellular fluid extracts water from the cells and causes hyponatremia until diuresis\noccurs.\n677\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 678 ---\n\n17.1\n17.2\n17.3\n17.4\n17.5\n17.6Study Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nAn elderly patient with a history of heart disease has difficulty breathing and is diagnosed with acute\npulmonary edema.

The loop diuretics are most effective in\nremoving large fluid volumes from the body and are the treatment of choice in this situation. In this situation,\nfurosemide should be administered intravenously. The other choices are inappropriate.\nA group of college students is planning a mountain climbing trip to the Andes. Which is most appropriate for\nthem to take to prevent altitude sickness?\nA.  A thiazide diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide\nB.  An anticholinergic such as atropine\nC.  A carbonic anhydrase inhibitor such as acetazolamide\nD.  A loop diuretic such as furosemide\nCorrect answer = C. Acetazolamide is used prophylactically for several days before an ascent above 10,000 feet.\nThis treatment prevents the cerebral and pulmonary problems associated with altitude sickness as well as other\ndifficulties, such as nausea.\nAn alcoholic male has developed hepatic cirrhosis. To control the ascites and edema, which should be\nprescribed?\nA.  Acetazolamide\nB.  Chlorthalidone\nC.  Furosemide\nD.  Spironolactone\nCorrect answer = D. Spironolactone is very effective in the treatment of hepatic edema. These patients are\nfrequently resistant to the diuretic action of loop diuretics, although a combination with spironolactone may be\nbeneficial. The other agents are not indicated.\nA 55-year-old male with kidney stones needs a medication to decrease urinary calcium excretion. Which\ndiuretic is best for this indication?\nA.  Torsemide\nB.  Hydrochlorothiazide\nC.  Spironolactone\nD.  Triamterene\nCorrect answer = B. Hydrochlorothiazide is effective in increasing calcium reabsorption, thus decreasing the\namount of calcium excreted, and decreasing the formation of kidney stones that contain calcium phosphate or\ncalcium oxalate. Furosemide increases the excretion of calcium, whereas the K+-sparing diuretics, spironolactone,\nand triamterene do not have an effect.\nA 75-year-old woman with hypertension and glaucoma is being treated with chlorthalidone, amlodipine,\nlisinopril, and acetazolamide. In clinic today, she complains of acute joint pain and redness in her great toe,\nwhich is diagnosed as gout. Which medication is most likely to have caused the gout attack?\nA.  Amlodipine\nB.  Acetazolamide\nC.  Chlorthalidone\nD.  Lisinopril\nCorrect answer = C. Thiazides such as chlorthalidone compete with uric acid for secretion into the lumen of the\nnephron at the proximal convoluted tubule. This competition decreases uric acid secretion, raising the serum\nconcentration and increasing the risk of a gout attack. Loop diuretics have the same risk.\nWhich is contraindicated in a patient with hyperkalemia?\nA.  Acetazolamide\nB.  Chlorothiazide\nC.  Ethacrynic acid\nD.  Eplerenone678\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 679 ---\n\n17.7\n17.8\n17.9\n17.10Correct answer = D. Eplerenone acts in the collecting tubule via aldosterone antagonism to inhibit Na+\nreabsorption and K+ excretion. It is extremely important that patients who are treated with any potassium-sparing\ndiuretic be closely monitored for potassium levels. Exogenous potassium supplementation is usually discontinued\nwhen potassium-sparing diuretic therapy is initiated. The other drugs promote the excretion of potassium.\nA 59-year-old male patient in the intensive care unit has a metabolic alkalosis. Which therapy will treat this\ncondition?\nA.  Amiloride\nB.  Hydrochlorothiazide\nC.  Mannitol\nD.  Acetazolamide\nCorrect answer = D. Acetazolamide causes an increase in the urinary excretion of bicarbonate, lowering the pH of\nthe blood.\nA male patient is placed on a new medication and notes that his breasts have become enlarged and tender to\nthe touch. Which medication is the most likely taking?\nA.  Furosemide\nB.  Hydrochlorothiazide\nC.  Spironolactone\nD.  Triamterene\nCorrect answer = C. An adverse drug reaction to spironolactone is gynecomastia due to its effects on androgens\nand progesterone in the body. Eplerenone may be a suitable alternative if the patient is in need of an aldosterone\nantagonist but has a history of gynecomastia.\nA patient with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction researched his medications on the Internet and\nfound he was taking two “diuretics,” bumetanide and spironolactone. He asks if this is a mistake with his\ntherapy. What is the best response?\nA.  Spironolactone is used to prevent hyponatremia.\nB.  Spironolactone is used to reduce heart structure changes and decrease the risk of death.\nC.  Bumetanide is used to decrease the potassium lost from spironolactone therapy.\nD.  This is a duplication error and one diuretic should be stopped.\nCorrect answer = B. Aldosterone antagonists are used at non-diuretic doses in heart failure to prevent myocardial\nremodeling and decrease mortality. Bumetanide is used as a diuretic to treat edema from heart failure. Both are\nappropriate to use together because of the unique indications. Spironolactone reduces the potassium lost from\ndiuresis with bumetanide.\nWhich diuretic has been shown to improve blood pressure in resistant hypertension or those already treated\nwith three blood pressure medications including a thiazide or thiazide-like medication?\nA.  Indapamide\nB.  Furosemide\nC.  Mannitol\nD.  Spironolactone\nCorrect answer = D. Resistant hypertension, defined by the use of three or more medications without reaching the\nblood pressure goal, often responds well to aldosterone antagonists. This effect can be seen in those with or\nwithout elevated aldosterone levels.679\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 680 ---\n\n18\nDrugs for Heart Failure\nShawn Anderson and Katherine Vogel Anderson\n680\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 681 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nHeart failure (HF) is a complex, progressive disorder in which the heart is unable to pump sufficient blood to meet\nthe needs of the body. Its cardinal symptoms are dyspnea, fatigue, and fluid retention. HF is due to an impaired\nability of the heart to adequately fill with and/or eject blood. It is often accompanied by abnormal increases in blood\nvolume and interstitial fluid. Underlying causes of HF include, but are not limited to, atherosclerotic heart disease,\nhypertensive heart disease, valvular heart disease, and congenital heart disease.\n681\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 682 ---\n\nA.  Role of physiologic compensatory mechanisms in the\nprogression of HF\nChronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) is\nassociated with remodeling of cardiac tissue, loss of myocytes, hypertrophy, and fibrosis. This prompts additional\nneurohormonal activation, creating a vicious cycle that, if left untreated, leads to death.\n682\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 683 ---\n\nB.  Goals of pharmacologic intervention in HF\nGoals of treatment are to alleviate symptoms, slow disease progression, and improve survival. The following classes\nof drugs have been shown to be effective: 1) angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, 2) angiotensin\nreceptor blockers, 3) aldosterone antagonists, 4) β-blockers, 5) diuretics, 6) direct vaso- and venodilators, 7)\nhyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel blockers, 8) inotropic agents, 9) the combination of a\nneprilysin inhibitor with an angiotensin receptor blocker, and 10) recombinant B-type natriuretic peptide (Figure\n18.1). Depending on the severity of HF and individual patient factors, one or more of these classes of drugs are\nadministered. Pharmacologic intervention provides the following benefits in HF: reduced myocardial work load,\ndecreased extracellular fluid volume, improved cardiac contractility, and a reduced rate of cardiac remodeling.\nKnowledge of the physiology of cardiac muscle contraction is essential for understanding the compensatory\nresponses evoked by the failing heart, as well as the actions of drugs used to treat HF.\n683\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 684 ---\n\n684\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 685 ---\n\nFigure 18.1 Summary of drugs used to treat HF. ACE = angiotensin-converting enzyme;\nARB = angiotensin receptor blocker; ARNI = angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor;\nFDC = fixed-dose combination; HCN = hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-\ngated.\n685\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 686 ---\n\nII.  Physiology of Muscle Contraction\nThe myocardium, like smooth and skeletal muscle, responds to stimulation by depolarization of the membrane,\nwhich is followed by shortening of the contractile proteins and ends with relaxation and return to the resting state\n(repolarization). Cardiac myocytes are interconnected in groups that respond to stimuli as a unit, contracting\ntogether whenever a single cell is stimulated.\n686\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 687 ---\n\nA.  Action potential\nCardiac myocytes are electrically excitable and have a spontaneous, intrinsic rhythm generated by specialized\n“pacemaker” cells located in the sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) nodes. Cardiac myocytes also have an\nunusually long action potential, which can be divided into five phases (0 to 4). Figure 18.2 illustrates the major ions\ncontributing to depolarization and repolarization of cardiac myocytes.\nFigure 18.2 Action potential of a cardiac myocyte. ATPase = adenosine triphosphatase.\n687\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 688 ---\n\nB.  Cardiac contraction\nThe force of contraction of the cardiac muscle is directly related to the concentration of free (unbound) cytosolic\ncalcium. Therefore, agents that increase intracellular calcium levels (or that increase the sensitivity of the contractile\nmachinery to calcium) increase the force of contraction (inotropic effect). The movement of calcium in cardiac\nmyocytes is illustrated in Figure 18.3.\nFigure 18.3 Ion movements during the contraction of cardiac muscle. ATPase =\nadenosine triphosphatase.\n688\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 689 ---\n\nC.  Compensatory physiological responses in HF\nThe failing heart evokes four major compensatory mechanisms to enhance cardiac output (Figure 18.4).\n689\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 690 ---\n\nFigure 18.4 Cardiovascular consequences of HF.\n1.  Increased sympathetic activity\nBaroreceptors sense a decrease in blood pressure and activate the sympathetic nervous system. In an attempt to\nsustain tissue perfusion, this stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors results in an increased heart rate and a greater\nforce of contraction of the heart muscle. In addition, vasoconstriction enhances venous return and increases cardiac\npreload. An increase in preload (stretch on the heart) increases stroke volume, which, in turn, increases cardiac\noutput. These compensatory responses increase the workload of the heart, which, in the long term, contributes to\nfurther decline in cardiac function.\n2.  Activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS)\nA fall in cardiac output decreases blood flow to the kidney, prompting the release of renin. Renin release is also\nstimulated by increased sympathetic activity resulting in increased formation of angiotensin II and release of690\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 691 ---\n\naldosterone. This results in increased peripheral resistance (afterload) and retention of sodium and water. Blood\nvolume increases, and more blood is returned to the heart. If the heart is unable to pump this extra volume, venous\npressure increases and peripheral and pulmonary edema occur. In addition, high levels of angiotensin II and\naldosterone have direct detrimental effects on cardiac muscle, favoring remodeling, fibrosis, and inflammatory\nchanges. Again, these compensatory responses increase the workload of the heart, contributing to further decline in\ncardiac function.\n3.  Activation of natriuretic peptides\nAn increase in preload also increases the release of natriuretic peptides. Natriuretic peptides, which include atrial, B-\ntype, and C-type, have differing roles in HF; atrial and B-type natriuretic peptides are the most important. Activation\nof the natriuretic peptides ultimately results in vasodilation, natriuresis, inhibition of renin and aldosterone release,\nand a reduction in myocardial fibrosis. This beneficial response may improve cardiac function and HF symptoms.\n4.  Myocardial hypertrophy\nInitially, stretching of the heart muscle leads to a stronger contraction of the heart. However, excessive elongation of\nthe fibers results in weaker contractions and a diminished ability to eject blood. This type of failure is termed\n“systolic failure” or HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and is the result of the ventricle being unable to\npump effectively. Patients with HF may have “diastolic dysfunction,” a term applied when the ability of the\nventricles to relax and accept blood is impaired by structural changes such as hypertrophy. The thickening of the\nventricular wall and subsequent decrease in ventricular volume decrease the ability of heart muscle to relax. In this\ncase, the ventricle does not fill adequately, and the inadequacy of cardiac output is termed “diastolic HF” or HF with\npreserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Diastolic dysfunction, in its pure form, is characterized by signs and symptoms\nof HF in the presence of a normal functioning left ventricle. However, both systolic and diastolic dysfunction\ncommonly coexist in HF.\n691\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 692 ---\n\nD.  Acute (decompensated) HF\nIf the compensatory mechanisms adequately restore cardiac output, HF is said to be compensated. If the\ncompensatory mechanisms fail to maintain cardiac output, HF is decompensated and the patient develops worsening\nHF signs and symptoms. Typical HF signs and symptoms include dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal\nnocturnal dyspnea, fatigue, and peripheral edema.\n692\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 693 ---\n\nE.  Therapeutic strategies in HF\nChronic HF is typically managed by fluid limitations (less than 1.5 to 2 L daily); low dietary intake of sodium (less\nthan 2000 mg/d); treatment of comorbid conditions; and judicious use of diuretics. Specifically for HFrEF, inhibitors\nof the RAAS, inhibitors of the sympathetic nervous system, and drugs that enhance activity of natriuretic peptides\nhave been shown to improve survival and reduce symptoms. Inotropic agents are reserved for acute signs and\nsymptoms of HF and are used mostly in the inpatient setting. Drugs that may precipitate or exacerbate HF, such as\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), alcohol, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and some\nantiarrhythmic drugs, should be avoided if possible.\n693\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 694 ---\n\nIII.  Inhibitors of the Renin–Angiotensin–Aldosterone System\nThe compensatory activation of the RAAS in HF leads to increased workload on the heart and a resultant decline in\ncardiac function. Therefore, inhibition of the RAAS is an important pharmacological target in the management of\nHF.\n694\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 695 ---\n\nA.  Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are a part of standard pharmacotherapy in HFrEF. These drugs\nblock the enzyme that cleaves angiotensin I to form the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. They also diminish the\ninactivation of bradykinin (Figure 18.5).\nFigure 18.5 Effects of ACE inhibitors. [Note: The reduced retention of sodium and water\nresults from two causes: decreased production of angiotensin II and aldosterone.]\n1.  Actions\nACE inhibitors decrease vascular resistance (afterload) and venous tone (preload), resulting in increased cardiac\noutput. ACE inhibitors also blunt the usual angiotensin II–mediated increase in epinephrine and aldosterone seen in\nHF. ACE inhibitors improve clinical signs and symptoms of HF and have been shown to significantly improve\npatient survival in HF.\n2.  Therapeutic use\nACE inhibitors may be considered for patients with asymptomatic and symptomatic HFrEF. Importantly, ACE\ninhibitors are indicated for patients with all stages of left ventricular failure. These agents should be started at low\ndoses and titrated to target or maximally tolerated doses in the management of HFrEF. ACE inhibitors are also used\nin the treatment of hypertension (see",

Angiotensin Receptor–Neprilysin Inhibitor\nNeprilysin is the enzyme responsible for breaking down vasoactive peptides, such as angiotensin I and II,\nbradykinin, and natriuretic peptides. Inhibition of neprilysin augments the activity of the vasoactive peptides. To\nmaximize the effect of natriuretic peptides, stimulation of the RAAS must be offset without further increase in\nbradykinin. Therefore an ARB, instead of an ACE inhibitor, is combined with a neprilysin inhibitor to reduce the\nincidence of angioedema (Figure 18.6).\nFigure 18.6 Effects of angiotensin receptor blocker–neprilysin inhibitors. ARB =\nangiotensin receptor blocker; ARNI = angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor; AT1 =\nangiotensin type 1; NI, neprilysin inhibitor; NP = natriuretic peptide; RAAS = renin–\nangiotensin–aldosterone system; SNS = sympathetic nervous system.\n700\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 701 ---\n\nA.  Sacubitril/valsartan\nSacubitril  [sak-UE-bi-tril]/ valsartan is the first available angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI).\n1.  Actions\nSacubitril /valsartan combines the actions of an ARB with neprilysin inhibition. Inhibition of neprilysin results in\nincreased concentration of vasoactive peptides, leading to natriuresis, diuresis, vasodilation, and inhibition of\nfibrosis. Together, the combination decreases afterload, preload, and myocardial fibrosis. An ARNI improves\nsurvival and clinical signs and symptoms of HF, as compared to therapy with an ACE inhibitor.\n2.  Therapeutic use\nAn ARNI should replace an ACE inhibitor or ARB in patients with HFrEF who remain symptomatic on optimal\ndoses of a β-blocker and an ACE inhibitor or ARB.\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\nSacubitril /valsartan is orally active, administered with or without food, and quickly breaks down into the separate\ncomponents. Sacubitril  is transformed to active drug by plasma esterases. Both drugs have a high volume of\ndistribution and are highly bound to plasma proteins. Sacubitril  is mainly excreted in the urine. The half-life of\napproximately 10 hours for both components allows for twice-daily dosing.\n4.  Adverse effects\nThe adverse effect profile is similar to that of an ACE inhibitor or ARB. Because of the added reduction of afterload,\nhypotension is more common with an ARNI. Due to inhibition of neprilysin with sacubitril , bradykinin levels may\nincrease and angioedema may occur. Therefore, the combination is contraindicated in patients with a history of\nhereditary angioedema or angioedema associated with an ACE inhibitor or ARB. To minimize risk of angioedema,\nan ACE inhibitor must be stopped at least 36 hours prior to starting sacubitril/valsartan.\n701\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 702 ---\n\nVII.

HR = heart rate; K+ =\npotassium; Na+ = sodium; SA = sinoatrial.\n702\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 703 ---\n\nA.  Ivabradine\nIvabradine [eye-VAB-ra-deen] is the only approved drug in the class of HCN channel blockers.\n1.  Actions\nBy selectively slowing the If current in the SA node, reduction of heart rate occurs without a reduction in\ncontractility, AV conduction, ventricular repolarization, or blood pressure. In patients with HFrEF, a slower heart\nrate increases stroke volume and improves symptoms of HF.\n2.  Therapeutic use\nIvabradine is utilized in HFrEF to improve symptoms in patients who are in sinus rhythm with a heart rate above 70\nbeats per minute and are on optimized HF pharmacotherapy. Specifically, patients should be on an optimal dose of\nβ-blocker or have a contraindication to β-blockers.\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\nIvabradine should be administered with meals to increase absorption. It undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism\nby cytochrome P450 3A4 to an active metabolite, which is also a 3A4 substrate. Ivabradine has a high volume of\ndistribution and is 70% protein bound. The half-life is 6 hours, which allows for twice-daily dosing.\n4.  Adverse effects\nBradycardia may occur with ivabradine, which may improve with dose reduction. Because ivabradine is mostly\nselective for the SA node, it is not effective for rate control in atrial fibrillation and has been shown to increase the\nrisk of atrial fibrillation. Ivabradine inhibits similar channels in the eye, and luminous phenomena may occur early\nin therapy. This enhanced brightness may be ameliorated by dose reduction. Ivabradine should not be used in\npregnancy or breast-feeding, with more advanced heart block, or with potent 3A4 inhibitors.\n703\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 704 ---\n\nVIII.  Vaso- and Venodilators\nDilation of venous blood vessels leads to a decrease in cardiac preload by increasing venous capacitance. Nitrates\nare commonly used venous dilators to reduce preload for patients with chronic HF. Arterial dilators, such as\nhydralazine [hye-DRAL-a-zeen], reduce systemic arteriolar resistance and decrease afterload. If the patient is\nintolerant of ACE inhibitors or ARBs, or if additional vasodilator response is required, a combination of hydralazine\nand isosorbide dinitrate [eye-soe-SOR-bide dye-NYE-trate] may be used. A fixed-dose combination of these agents\nhas been shown to improve symptoms and survival in black patients with HFrEF on standard HF treatment (β-\nblocker plus ACE inhibitor or ARB). Headache, dizziness, and hypotension are common adverse effects with this\ncombination. Rarely, hydralazine has been associated with drug-induced lupus.\n704\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 705 ---\n\nIX.  Inotropic Drugs\nPositive inotropic agents enhance cardiac contractility and, thus, increase cardiac output. Although these drugs act\nby different mechanisms, the inotropic action is the result of an increased cytoplasmic calcium concentration that\nenhances the contractility of cardiac muscle. All positive inotropes in HFrEF that increase intracellular calcium\nconcentration have been associated with reduced survival, especially in patients with HFrEF. For this reason, these\nagents, with the exception of digoxin, are only used for a short period mainly in the inpatient setting.\n705\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 706 ---\n\nA.  Digitalis glycosides\nThe cardiac glycosides are often called digitalis or digitalis glycosides, because most of the drugs come from the\ndigitalis (foxglove) plant. They are a group of chemically similar compounds that can increase the contractility of\nthe heart muscle and, therefore, are used in treating HF. The digitalis glycosides have a low therapeutic index, with\nonly a small difference between a therapeutic dose and doses that are toxic or even fatal. The only available agent is\ndigoxin [di-JOX-in].\n1.  Mechanism of action\na.  Regulation of cytosolic calcium concentration\nBy inhibiting the Na+/K+-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) enzyme, digoxin reduces the ability of the myocyte to\nactively pump Na+ from the cell (Figure 18.8). This ultimately results in a small but physiologically important\nincrease in free Ca2+, thereby leading to increased cardiac contractility.\nFigure 18.8 Mechanism of action of digoxin. ATPase = adenosine triphosphatase.\nb.  Increased contractility of the cardiac muscle\nDigoxin increases the force of cardiac contraction, causing cardiac output to more closely resemble that of the\nnormal heart (Figure 18.9). Vagal tone is also enhanced, so both heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand decrease.\nDigoxin slows conduction velocity through the AV node, making it useful for atrial fibrillation.\n706\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 707 ---\n\nFigure 18.9 Ventricular function curves in the normal heart, in heart failure (HF), and in\nHF treated with digoxin.\nc.  Neurohormonal inhibition\nAlthough the exact mechanism of this effect has not been elucidated, low-dose digoxin inhibits sympathetic\nactivation with minimal effects on contractility. This effect is the reason a lower serum drug concentration is\ntargeted in HFrEF.\n2.  Therapeutic use\nDigoxin therapy is indicated in patients with HFrEF who are symptomatic on optimal HF pharmacotherapy. A low\nserum drug concentration of digoxin (0.5 to 0.8 ng/mL) is beneficial in HFrEF.\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\nDigoxin is available in oral and injectable formulations. It has a large volume of distribution, because it accumulates\nin muscle. The dosage is based on lean body weight. In acute situations, such as symptomatic atrial fibrillation, a\nloading dose regimen is used. Digoxin has a long half-life of 30 to 40 hours. It is mainly eliminated intact by the\nkidney, requiring dose adjustment in renal dysfunction.\n4.  Adverse effects\nAt low serum drug concentrations, digoxin is well tolerated. However, it has a very narrow therapeutic index.\nAnorexia, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, or yellowish vision may be initial indicators of toxicity. When Na+/K+-\nATPase is markedly inhibited by digoxin, the resting membrane potential may increase, which makes the membrane\nmore excitable, increasing the risk of arrhythmias. Decreased levels of serum potassium (hypokalemia) predispose a\npatient to digoxin toxicity, because digoxin normally competes with potassium for the same binding site on the\nNa+/K+-ATPase pump. With the use of a lower serum drug concentration in HFrEF, toxic levels are infrequent.\nDigoxin is a substrate of P-gp, and inhibitors of P-gp, such as clarithromycin, verapamil , and amiodarone, can\nsignificantly increase digoxin levels, necessitating a reduced dose of digoxin. Digoxin should also be used with\ncaution with other drugs that slow AV conduction, such as β-blockers, verapamil , and diltiazem.\n707\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 708 ---\n\nB.  β-Adrenergic agonists\nβ-Adrenergic agonists, such as dobutamine [doe-BUE-ta-meen] and dopamine [DOE-pa-meen], improve cardiac\nperformance by causing positive inotropic effects and vasodilation. β-Adrenergic agonists ultimately lead to\nincreased entry of calcium ions into myocardial cells and enhanced contraction (Figure 18.10). Both drugs must be\ngiven by intravenous infusion and are primarily used in the short-term treatment of acute HF in the hospital setting.\nFigure 18.10 Sites of action by β-adrenergic agonists on heart muscle. AMP = adenosine\nmonophosphate; ATP = adenosine triphosphate; cAMP = cyclic adenosine\nmonophosphate; P = phosphate.\n708\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 709 ---\n\nC.  Phosphodiesterase inhibitors\nMilrinone [MIL-ri-none] is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that increases the intracellular concentration of cAMP\n(Figure 18.10). Like β-adrenergic agonists, this results in an increase of intracellular calcium and, therefore, cardiac\ncontractility. Milrinone is usually given by intravenous infusion for short-term treatment of acute HF. However,\ndobutamine and milrinone may also be considered for intermediate-term treatment in the outpatient setting for\npalliative care.\n709\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 710 ---\n\nX.  Recombinant B-type Natriuretic Peptide\nIn acute decompensated congestive HF, drugs that reduce preload result in improvement in HF symptoms such as\ndyspnea. Most often, IV diuretics are utilized in the acute setting to reduce preload. When IV diuretics are minimally\neffective, a recombinant B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), or nesiritide [ness-EAR-a-tide], can be used as an\nalternative. Through binding to natriuretic peptide receptors, nesiritide stimulates natriuresis and diuresis and\nreduces preload and afterload. Nesiritide is administered intravenously as a bolus (most often) and continuous\ninfusion. Like endogenous BNP, nesiritide has a short half-life of 20 minutes and is cleared by renal filtration,\ncleavage by endopeptidases and through internalization after binding to natriuretic peptide receptors. The most\ncommon adverse effects are hypotension and dizziness, and like diuretics, nesiritide can worsen renal function.\n710\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 711 ---\n\nXI.  Order of Therapy\nGuidelines have classified HF into four stages, from least to most severe. Figure 18.11 shows a treatment strategy\nusing this classification and the drugs described in this chapter. Note that as the disease progresses, polytherapy is\ninitiated. In patients with overt HF, loop diuretics are often introduced first for relief of signs or symptoms of\nvolume overload, such as dyspnea and peripheral edema. ACE inhibitors or ARBs (if ACE inhibitors are not\ntolerated) are added after the optimization of diuretic therapy. The dosage is gradually titrated to that which is\nmaximally tolerated and/or produces optimal cardiac output. Historically, β-blockers were added after optimization\nof ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy; however, most patients newly diagnosed with HFrEF are initiated on both low\ndoses of an ACE inhibitor and β-blocker after initial stabilization. These agents are slowly titrated to optimal levels\nto increase tolerability. Aldosterone antagonists and fixed-dose hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate are initiated in\npatients who continue to have HF symptoms despite optimal doses of an ACE inhibitor and β-blocker. Once at an\noptimal ACE inhibitor or ARB dose and if the patient remains symptomatic, either can be replaced by\nsacubitril/valsartan. Lastly, digoxin and ivabradine are added for symptomatic benefit only in patients on optimal\nHF pharmacotherapy.\nFigure 18.11 Treatment options for various stages of HF. ACE = angiotensin-converting\nenzyme; ARBs = angiotensin receptor blockers; FDC = fixed-dose combination; HYD =\nhydralazine; ISDN = isosorbide dinitrate. Stage D (refractory symptoms requiring special\ninterventions) is not shown.\n711\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 712 ---\n\n18.1\n18.2\n18.3\n18.4\n18.5\n18.6Study Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nA patient is newly diagnosed with HFrEF and is asymptomatic. Which is the most appropriate drug to\ninitiate for symptomatic and survival benefits?\nA.  Dobutamine\nB.  Furosemide\nC.  Lisinopril\nD.  Sacubitril/valsartan\nCorrect answer = C. ACE inhibitors should be initiated in all patients, unless contraindicated, if they have HFrEF\nand are asymptomatic. This is known as stage B HF. Dobutamine and furosemide improve symptoms only.\nSacubitril/valsartan will replace an ACE inhibitor if the patient remains symptomatic on optimal HF\npharmacotherapy.\nWhich of the following statements best describes the action of ACE inhibitors on the failing heart?\nA.  Increased vascular resistance.\nB.  Decreased cardiac output.\nC.  Reduced preload.\nD.  Increased aldosterone.\nCorrect answer = C. ACE inhibitors decrease vascular resistance, decrease preload, decrease afterload, and\nincrease cardiac output. In addition, ACE inhibitors blunt aldosterone release.\nA Hispanic man with HFrEF currently takes maximally tolerated doses of metoprolol succinate and\nenalapril, along with moderate-dose furosemide. He is euvolemic, but continues to have HF symptoms. The\nsystolic blood pressure is low, but the patient does not have signs or symptoms of hypotension. Which is the\nbest recommendation to improve HF symptoms and survival in this patient?\nA.  Stop enalapril, wait 36 hours, and start sacubitril/valsartan.\nB.  Start digoxin.\nC.  Start fixed-dose hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate.\nD.  Start spironolactone.\nCorrect answer = D. Because the patient is on optimal pharmacotherapy and continues to have symptoms, another\nagent is warranted. Adding low-dose spironolactone is unlikely to decrease the blood pressure and will confer a\nsurvival and symptomatic benefit. Changing to sacubitril/valsartan will likely worsen the low blood pressure.\nDigoxin will only improve symptoms and not improve survival. Fixed-dose hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate\nwould be appropriate if the patient were African American.\nβ-Blockers improve cardiac function in HF by\nA.  decreasing cardiac remodeling\nB.  increasing heart rate\nC.  increasing renin release\nD.  activating norepinephrine\nCorrect answer = A. Although it seems counterintuitive to decrease heart rate in HF, β-blockers improve cardiac\nfunction by slowing heart rate, decreasing renin release, and preventing the direct effects of norepinephrine on\ncardiac muscle to decrease remodeling.\nA 70-year-old woman has HFrEF and hypertension. She takes lisinopril and metoprolol tartrate. She feels\nwell and has no cough, shortness of breath, or edema. Which of the following changes is most appropriate\nfor her drug therapy?\nA.  Initiate digoxin.\nB.  Change lisinopril to losartan.\nC.  Initiate ivabradine.\nD.  Change metoprolol tartrate to metoprolol succinate.\nCorrect answer = D. Metoprolol succinate should be used in HF, given that there is mortality benefit shown with\nmetoprolol succinate in landmark HF trials. Digoxin and ivabradine are not indicated since symptoms are\nminimal and she is not yet on optimized guideline-directed medical therapy; there is no reason to change to an\nARB since the patient has no cough or history of angioedema.\nA 75-year-old white man has HFrEF and reports stable HF symptoms. His current drug therapy includes\noptimal-dose enalapril, carvedilol, and spironolactone. Which is the best recommendation to improve HF\nsymptoms and survival?\nA.  Start fixed-dose hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate.\nB.  Start ivabradine.712\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 713 ---\n\n18.7\n18.8\n18.9\n18.10C.  Replace enalapril with sacubitril/valsartan.\nD.  Start digoxin.\nCorrect answer = C. Since patient is on optimal doses of HF medications and he continues to have symptoms,\nreplacing enalapril with sacubitril/valsartan is the only option that improves both symptoms and survival in a\nwhite patient.\nHow is spironolactone beneficial in HF?\nA.  Promotes potassium secretion\nB.  Acts as aldosterone agonist\nC.  Prevents cardiac hypertrophy\nD.  Decreases blood glucose\nCorrect answer = C. Spironolactone antagonizes aldosterone, which in turn prevents salt/water retention, cardiac\nhypertrophy, and hypokalemia. Spironolactone has endocrine effects on hormones, but not on glucose.\nWhich of the following is important to monitor in patients taking digoxin?\nA.  Chloride\nB.  Potassium\nC.  Sodium\nD.  Zinc\nCorrect answer = B. Hypokalemia can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias and increases the potential of cardiac\ntoxicity with digoxin.\nWhich of the following describes the mechanism of action of milrinone in HF?\nA.  Decreases intracellular calcium\nB.  Increases cardiac contractility\nC.  Decreases cAMP\nD.  Activates phosphodiesterase\nCorrect answer = B. Milrinone is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that leads to increased cAMP, increased\nintracellular calcium, and therefore increased contractility.\nBH is a 52-year-old African American woman who has HFrEF. She is seen in clinic today reporting stable\nHF symptoms, but is having occasional peripheral brightness. Otherwise, vision is unchanged. Current\nmedication regimen includes sacubitril/valsartan, carvedilol, fixed-dose hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate,\nivabradine, and bumetanide. Which is the best recommendation to minimize the adverse effect of peripheral\nbrightness?\nA.  Stop all HF medications immediately.\nB.  Discontinue sacubitril/valsartan only.\nC.  Do nothing; this adverse effect will slowly improve over time.\nD.  Reduce the dose of ivabradine.\nCorrect answer = D. Luminous phenomena can occur with ivabradine. This adverse effect can be minimized with\ndose reduction or discontinuation.\n713\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 714 ---\n\n19\nAntiarrhythmics\nShawn Anderson and Michelle Chung\n714\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 715 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nIn contrast to skeletal muscle, which contracts only when it receives a stimulus, the heart contains specialized cells\nthat exhibit automaticity. That is, they intrinsically generate rhythmic action potentials in the absence of external\nstimuli. These “pacemaker” cells differ from other myocardial cells in showing a slow, spontaneous depolarization\nduring diastole (phase 4), caused by an inward positive current carried by sodium and calcium ions. This\ndepolarization is fastest in the sinoatrial (SA) node (the initiation site of the action potential), and it decreases\nthroughout the normal conduction pathway through the atrioventricular (AV) node to the bundle of His and the\nPurkinje system. Dysfunction of impulse generation or conduction at any of a number of sites in the heart can cause\nan abnormality in cardiac rhythm. Figure 19.1 summarizes the drugs used to treat cardiac arrhythmias.\nFigure 19.1 Summary of antiarrhythmic drugs.\n715\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 716 ---\n\n716\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 717 ---\n\nII.  Introduction to the Arrhythmias\nArrhythmias are caused by abnormalities in impulse formation and conduction in the myocardium. Arrhythmias\npresent as a complex family of disorders with a variety of symptoms. To make sense of this large group of disorders,\nit is useful to organize arrhythmias into groups according to anatomic site of the abnormality: the atria, the AV node,\nor the ventricles. Figure 19.2 summarizes several common arrhythmias.\nFigure 19.2 Therapeutic indications for some commonly encountered arrhythmias. AV =\natrioventricular.\n717\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 718 ---\n\nA.  Causes of arrhythmias\nMost arrhythmias arise either from aberrations in impulse generation (abnormal automaticity) or from a defect in\nimpulse conduction.\n1.  Abnormal automaticity\nThe SA node shows a faster rate of discharge than do other pacemaker cells, and thus, it normally sets the pace of\ncontraction for the myocardium. If cardiac sites other than the SA node show enhanced automaticity, they may\ngenerate competing stimuli, and arrhythmias may arise. Most of the antiarrhythmic agents suppress automaticity by\nblocking either sodium (Na+) or calcium (Ca2+) channels to reduce the ratio of these ions to potassium (K+). This\ndecreases the slope of phase 4 (diastolic) depolarization and/or raises the threshold of discharge to a less negative\nvoltage, leading to an overall decrease in frequency of discharge. This effect is more pronounced in cells with\nectopic pacemaker activity than in normal cells.\n2.  Abnormalities in impulse conduction\nImpulses from higher pacemaker centers are normally conducted down pathways that bifurcate to activate the entire\nventricular surface (Figure 19.3). A phenomenon called reentry can occur if a unidirectional block caused by\nmyocardial injury or a prolonged refractory period results in an abnormal conduction pathway. Reentry is the most\ncommon cause of arrhythmias, and it can occur at any level of the cardiac conduction system. This short-circuit\npathway results in reexcitation of cardiac muscle, causing premature contraction or a sustained arrhythmia.\nAntiarrhythmic agents prevent reentry by slowing conduction (class I drugs) and/or increasing the refractory period\n(class III drugs), thereby converting a unidirectional block into a bidirectional block.\n718\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 719 ---\n\nFigure 19.3 Schematic representation of reentry.\n719\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 720 ---\n\nB.  Antiarrhythmic drugs\nAntiarrhythmic drugs can modify impulse generation and conduction to prevent arrhythmias or to reduce symptoms\nassociated with arrhythmias. Unfortunately, many of the antiarrhythmic agents are known to have dangerous\nproarrhythmic actions—that is, to cause arrhythmias. Inhibition of K+ channels widens the action potential and can,\nthus, prolong the QT interval. If prolongation is excessive, these drugs increase the risk of developing life-\nthreatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias (torsades de pointes). The most common cause of QT prolongation is drug-\ninduced, although other conditions (for example, ischemia and hypokalemia) and genetic abnormalities may\ncontribute. In addition to antiarrhythmics, many other drugs are known to prolong the QT interval, such as\nmacrolide antibiotics and antipsychotics. Caution should be employed when combining drugs with additive effects\non the QT interval or when giving QT-prolonging antiarrhythmic agents with drugs known to inhibit their\nmetabolism.\nAntiarrhythmic drugs can be classified (Vaughan-Williams classification) according to their predominant effects\non the action potential (Figure 19.4). Although this classification is convenient, it has some limitations. Many\nantiarrhythmic drugs have actions relating to more than one class or may have active metabolites with a different\nclass of action, or may have an action that does not meet any formal classification.\nFigure 19.4 Actions of antiarrhythmic drugs. SA = sinoatrial; AV = atrioventricular.\n720\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 721 ---\n\nIII.  Class I Antiarrhythmic Drugs\nClass I antiarrhythmic drugs act by blocking voltage-sensitive Na+ channels. They bind more rapidly to open or\ninactivated Na+ channels than to channels that are fully repolarized. Therefore, these drugs show a greater degree of\nblockade in tissues that are frequently depolarizing. This property is called use dependence (or state dependence),\nand it enables these drugs to block cells that are discharging at an abnormally high frequency, without interfering\nwith the normal beating of the heart.\nThe use of Na+ channel blockers has declined due to their proarrhythmic effects, particularly in patients with\nreduced left ventricular function and atherosclerotic heart disease. Class I drugs are further subdivided into three\ngroups according to their effect on the duration of the cardiac action potential (Figure 19.4).\n721\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 722 ---\n\nA.  Class IA antiarrhythmic drugs: Quinidine, procainamide, and\ndisopyramide\nQuinidine [KWIH-nih-deen] is the prototype class IA drug. Other agents in this class include procainamide [proe-\nKANE-a-mide] and disopyramide [dye-soe-PEER-a-mide]. Because of their concomitant class III activity, they can\nprecipitate arrhythmias that can progress to ventricular fibrillation.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nQuinidine binds to open and inactivated Na+ channels and prevents Na+ influx, thus slowing the rapid upstroke\nduring phase 0 (Figure 19.5). It decreases the slope of phase 4 spontaneous depolarization, inhibits K+ channels, and\nblocks Ca2+ channels. Because of these actions, it slows conduction velocity and increases refractoriness. Quinidine\nalso has mild α-adrenergic blocking and anticholinergic actions. Although procainamide and disopyramide have\nactions similar to those of quinidine, there is less anticholinergic activity with procainamide and more with\ndisopyramide. Neither procainamide nor disopyramide has α-blocking activity. Disopyramide produces a greater\nnegative inotropic effect, and unlike the other drugs, it causes peripheral vasoconstriction.\n722\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 723 ---\n\n723\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 724 ---\n\nFigure 19.5 Schematic diagram of the effects of class IA agents. INa and IK are\ntransmembrane currents due to the movement of Na+ and K+, respectively.\n2.  Therapeutic uses\nQuinidine is used in the treatment of a wide variety of arrhythmias, including atrial, AV junctional, and ventricular\ntachyarrhythmias. Procainamide is only available in an intravenous formulation and may be used to treat acute atrial\nand ventricular arrhythmias. However, electrical cardioversion or defibrillation and amiodarone have mostly\nreplaced procainamide in clinical practice. Disopyramide can be used as an alternative treatment of ventricular\narrhythmias and may also be used for rhythm control in atrial fibrillation or flutter.\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\nQuinidine sulfate or gluconate is rapidly and well absorbed after oral administration. It undergoes extensive\nmetabolism primarily by the hepatic cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) isoenzyme, forming active metabolites. A\nportion of procainamide is acetylated in the liver to N-acetylprocainamide (NAPA), which has the properties and\nadverse effects of a class III drug. NAPA is eliminated via the kidney; therefore, dosages of procainamide should be\nadjusted in patients with renal dysfunction. Disopyramide is well absorbed after oral administration and is\nmetabolized in the liver by CYP3A4 to a less active metabolite and several inactive metabolites. About half of the\ndrug is excreted unchanged by the kidneys.\n4.  Adverse effects\nDue to enhanced proarrhythmic effects and ability to worsen heart failure symptoms, class IA drugs should not be\nused in patients with atherosclerotic heart disease or systolic heart failure. Large doses of quinidine may induce the\nsymptoms of cinchonism (for example, blurred vision, tinnitus, headache, disorientation, and psychosis). Drug\ninteractions are common with quinidine since it is an inhibitor of both CYP2D6 and P-glycoprotein. Intravenous\nadministration of procainamide may cause hypotension. Disopyramide has the most anticholinergic adverse effects\nof the class IA drugs (for example, dry mouth, urinary retention, blurred vision, and constipation). Both quinidine\nand disopyramide should be used with caution with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4.\n724\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 725 ---\n\nB.  Class IB antiarrhythmic drugs: Lidocaine and mexiletine\nThe class IB agents rapidly associate and dissociate from Na+ channels. Thus, the actions are greater when the\ncardiac cell is depolarized or firing rapidly. The class IB drugs lidocaine [LYE-doe-kane] and mexiletine [mex-IL-e-\nteen] are useful in treating ventricular arrhythmias.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nIn addition to Na+ channel blockade, lidocaine and mexiletine shorten phase 3 repolarization and decrease the\nduration of the action potential (Figure 19.6). Neither drug contributes to negative inotropy.\n725\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 726 ---\n\n726\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 727 ---\n\nFigure 19.6 Schematic diagram of the effects of class IB agents. INa and IK are\ntransmembrane currents due to the movement of Na+ and K+, respectively.\n2.  Therapeutic uses\nAlthough amiodarone is the drug of choice for ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia (VT), lidocaine may\nbe used as an alternative. Lidocaine may also be used in combination with amiodarone for VT storm. The drug does\nnot markedly slow conduction and, thus, has little effect on atrial or AV junction arrhythmias. Mexiletine is used for\nchronic treatment of ventricular arrhythmias, often in combination with amiodarone.\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\nLidocaine is given intravenously because of extensive first-pass transformation by the liver. The drug is dealkylated\nto two active metabolites, primarily by CYP1A2 with a minor role by CYP3A4. Lidocaine should be monitored\nclosely when given in combination with drugs affecting these CYP isoenzymes. Mexiletine is well absorbed after\noral administration. It is metabolized in the liver primarily by CYP2D6 to inactive metabolites and excreted mainly\nvia the biliary route.\n4.  Adverse effects\nLidocaine has a fairly wide therapeutic index. Central nervous system (CNS) effects include nystagmus (early\nindicator of toxicity), drowsiness, slurred speech, paresthesia, agitation, confusion, and convulsions, which often\nlimit the duration of continuous infusions. Mexiletine has a narrow therapeutic index and caution should be used\nwhen administering the drug with inhibitors of CYP2D6. Nausea, vomiting, and dyspepsia are the most common\nadverse effects.\n727\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 728 ---\n\nC.  Class IC antiarrhythmic drugs: Flecainide and propafenone\nThese drugs slowly dissociate from resting Na+ channels and show prominent effects even at normal heart rates. Due\nto their negative inotropic and proarrhythmic effects, use of these agents is avoided in patients with structural heart\ndisease (left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, atherosclerotic heart disease).\n1.  Mechanism of action\nFlecainide [FLEK-a-nide] suppresses phase 0 upstroke in Purkinje and myocardial fibers ( Figure 19.7). This causes\nmarked slowing of conduction in all cardiac tissue, with a minor effect on the duration of the action potential and\nrefractoriness. Automaticity is reduced by an increase in the threshold potential, rather than a decrease in slope of\nphase 4 depolarization. Flecainide also blocks K+ channels, leading to increased duration of the action potential.\nPropafenone [proe-PAF-e-none], like flecainide, slows conduction in all cardiac tissues but does not block K+\nchannels. It possesses weak β-blocking properties.\n728\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 729 ---\n\n729\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 730 ---\n\nFigure 19.7 Schematic diagram of the effects of class IC agents. INa and IK are\ntransmembrane currents due to the movement of Na+ and K+, respectively.\n2.  Therapeutic uses\nFlecainide is useful in the maintenance of sinus rhythm in atrial flutter or fibrillation in patients without structural\nheart disease and in treating refractory ventricular arrhythmias. Use of propafenone is restricted mostly to atrial\narrhythmias: rhythm control of atrial fibrillation or flutter and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia prophylaxis\nin patients with AV reentrant tachycardias.\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\nFlecainide is well absorbed after oral administration and is metabolized by CYP2D6 to multiple metabolites. The\nparent drug and metabolites are mostly eliminated renally. Propafenone is metabolized to active metabolites\nprimarily via CYP2D6, and also by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. The metabolites are excreted in the urine and the feces.\n4.  Adverse effects\nFlecainide is generally well tolerated, with blurred vision, dizziness, and nausea occurring most frequently.\nPropafenone has a similar side effect profile, but may cause bronchospasm and should be avoided in patients with\nasthma. Propafenone is also an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. Both drugs should be used with caution with potent\ninhibitors of CYP2D6.\n730\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 731 ---\n\nIV.  Class II Antiarrhythmic Drugs\nClass II agents are β-adrenergic antagonists, or β-blockers. These drugs diminish phase 4 depolarization and, thus,\ndepress automaticity, prolong AV conduction, and decrease heart rate and contractility. Class II agents are useful in\ntreating tachyarrhythmias caused by increased sympathetic activity. They are also used for atrial flutter and\nfibrillation and for AV nodal reentrant tachycardia. In addition, β-blockers prevent life-threatening ventricular\narrhythmias following a myocardial infarction.\nMetoprolol  [me-TOE-pro-lol] is the most widely used β-blocker for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.\nCompared to nonselective β-blockers, such as propranolol  [pro-PRAN-oh-lol], it reduces the risk of bronchospasm.\nIt is extensively metabolized by CYP2D6 and has CNS penetration (less than propranolol , but more than atenolol\n[a-TEN-oh-lol]). Esmolol  [ES-moe-lol] is a very short and fast-acting β-blocker used for intravenous administration\nin acute arrhythmias that occur during surgery or emergency situations. Esmolol  is rapidly metabolized by esterases\nin red blood cells. As such, there are no pharmacokinetic drug interactions. Common adverse effects with β-blockers\ninclude bradycardia, hypotension, and fatigue (see",

Class III Antiarrhythmic Drugs\nClass III agents block K+ channels and, thus, diminish the outward K+ current during repolarization of cardiac cells.\nThese agents prolong the duration of the action potential without altering phase 0 of depolarization or the resting\nmembrane potential (Figure 19.8). Instead, they prolong the effective refractory period, increasing refractoriness. All\nclass III drugs have the potential to induce arrhythmias.\n732\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 733 ---\n\n733\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 734 ---\n\nFigure 19.8 Schematic diagram of the effects of class III agents.

Mechanism of action\nAmiodarone [a-MEE-oh-da-rone] contains iodine and is related structurally to thyroxine. It has complex effects,\nshowing class I, II, III, and IV actions, as well as α-blocking activity. Its dominant effect is prolongation of the\naction potential duration and the refractory period by blocking K+ channels.\n2.  Therapeutic uses\nAmiodarone is effective in the treatment of severe refractory supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmias.\nAmiodarone has been a mainstay of therapy for the rhythm management of atrial fibrillation or flutter. Despite its\nadverse effect profile, amiodarone is thought to be the least proarrhythmic of the class I and III antiarrhythmic\ndrugs.\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\nAmiodarone is incompletely absorbed after oral administration. The drug is unusual in having a prolonged half-life\nof several weeks, and it distributes extensively in tissues. Full clinical effects may not be achieved until months after\ninitiation of treatment, unless loading doses are employed.\n4.  Adverse effects\nAmiodarone shows a variety of toxic effects, including pulmonary fibrosis, neuropathy, hepatotoxicity, corneal\ndeposits, optic neuritis, blue-gray skin discoloration, and hypo- or hyperthyroidism. However, use of low doses and\nclose monitoring reduce toxicity, while retaining clinical efficacy. Amiodarone is subject to numerous drug\ninteractions, since it is metabolized by CYP3A4 and serves as an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and P-\nglycoprotein.\n735\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 736 ---\n\nB.  Dronedarone\nDronedarone [droe-NE-da-rone] is a benzofuran amiodarone derivative, which is less lipophilic and has a shorter\nhalf-life than amiodarone. It does not have the iodine moieties that are responsible for thyroid dysfunction\nassociated with amiodarone. Like amiodarone, it has class I, II, III, and IV actions. Dronedarone has a better\nadverse effect profile than does amiodarone but may still cause liver failure. The drug is contraindicated in those\nwith symptomatic heart failure or permanent atrial fibrillation due to an increased risk of death. Currently,\ndronedarone is used to maintain sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation or flutter, but it is less effective than amiodarone.\n736\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 737 ---\n\nC.  Sotalol\nSotalol  [SOE-ta-lol], although a class III antiarrhythmic agent, also has nonselective β-blocker activity. The\nlevorotatory isomer (L-sotalol ) has β-blocking activity and D-sotalol  has class III antiarrhythmic action. Sotalol\nblocks a rapid outward K+ current, known as the delayed rectifier current. This blockade prolongs both\nrepolarization and duration of the action potential, thus lengthening the effective refractory period. Sotalol  is used\nfor maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or refractory paroxysmal\nsupraventricular tachycardia and in the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. Since sotalol  has β-blocking properties,\nit is commonly used for these indications in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy or atherosclerotic heart\ndisease. This drug can cause the typical adverse effects associated with β-blockers but has a low rate of adverse\neffects when compared to other antiarrhythmic agents. The dosing interval should be extended in patients with renal\ndisease, since the drug is renally eliminated. To reduce the risk of proarrhythmic effects, sotalol  should be initiated\nin the hospital to monitor QT interval.\n737\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 738 ---\n\nD.  Dofetilide\nDofetilide [doe-FET-i-lide] is a pure K+ channel blocker. It can be used as a first-line antiarrhythmic agent in\npatients with persistent atrial fibrillation and heart failure or in those with coronary artery disease. Because of the\nrisk of proarrhythmia, dofetilide initiation is limited to the inpatient setting. The half-life of this oral drug is 10\nhours. The drug is mainly excreted unchanged in the urine. Drugs that inhibit active tubular secretion are\ncontraindicated with dofetilide.\n738\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 739 ---\n\nE.  Ibutilide\nIbutilide [eye-BUE-til-ide] is a K+ channel blocker that also activates the inward Na+ current (mixed class III and IA\nactions). Ibutilide is the drug of choice for chemical conversion of atrial flutter, but electrical cardioversion has\nsupplanted its use. It undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism and is not used orally. Initiation is also limited to the\ninpatient setting due to the risk of arrhythmia.\n739\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 740 ---\n\nVI.  Class IV Antiarrhythmic Drugs\nClass IV drugs are the nondihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blockers verapamil  [ver-AP-a-mil] and diltiazem [dil-TYE-\na-zem]. Although voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels occur in many different tissues, the major effect of Ca2+ channel\nblockers is on vascular smooth muscle and the heart. Both drugs show greater action on the heart than on vascular\nsmooth muscle, but more so with verapamil . In the heart, verapamil  and diltiazem bind only to open depolarized\nvoltage-sensitive channels, thus decreasing the inward current carried by Ca2+. These drugs are use dependent in that\nthey prevent repolarization until the drug dissociates from the channel, resulting in a decreased rate of phase 4\nspontaneous depolarization. They also slow conduction in tissues that are dependent on Ca2+ currents, such as the\nAV and SA nodes (Figure 19.9). These agents are more effective against atrial than against ventricular arrhythmias.\nThey are useful in treating reentrant supraventricular tachycardia and in reducing the ventricular rate in atrial flutter\nand fibrillation. Common adverse effects include bradycardia, hypotension, and peripheral edema. Both drugs are\nmetabolized in the liver by CYP3A4. Dosage adjustments may be needed in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Both\nagents are subject to many drug interactions as they are CYP3A4 inhibitors, as well as substrates and inhibitors of P-\nglycoprotein.\n740\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 741 ---\n\n741\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 742 ---\n\nFigure 19.9 Schematic diagram of the effects of class IV agents.

Other Antiarrhythmic Drugs\n743\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 744 ---\n\nA.  Digoxin\nDigoxin [di-JOX-in] inhibits the Na+/K+-ATPase pump, ultimately shortening the refractory period in atrial and\nventricular myocardial cells while prolonging the effective refractory period and diminishing conduction velocity in\nthe AV node. Digoxin is used to control ventricular response rate in atrial fibrillation and flutter; however,\nsympathetic stimulation easily overcomes the inhibitory effects of digoxin. At toxic concentrations, digoxin causes\nectopic ventricular beats that may result in VT and fibrillation. [Note: Serum trough concentrations of 1.0 to 2.0\nng/mL are desirable for atrial fibrillation or flutter, whereas lower concentrations of 0.5 to 0.8 ng/mL are targeted for\nsystolic heart failure.]\n744\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 745 ---\n\nB.  Adenosine\nAdenosine [ah-DEN-oh-seen] is a naturally occurring nucleoside, but at high doses, the drug decreases conduction\nvelocity, prolongs the refractory period, and decreases automaticity in the AV node. Intravenous adenosine is the\ndrug of choice for converting acute supraventricular tachycardias. It has low toxicity but causes flushing, chest pain,\nand hypotension. Adenosine has an extremely short duration of action (approximately 10 to 15 seconds) due to rapid\nuptake by erythrocytes and endothelial cells.\n745\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 746 ---\n\nC.  Magnesium sulfate\nMagnesium is necessary for the transport of Na+, Ca2+, and K+ across cell membranes. It slows the rate of SA node\nimpulse formation and prolongs conduction time along the myocardial tissue. Intravenous magnesium sulfate is the\nsalt used to treat arrhythmias, as oral magnesium is not effective in the setting of arrhythmia. Most notably,\nmagnesium is the drug of choice for treating the potentially fatal arrhythmia torsades de pointes and digoxin-induced\narrhythmias.\n746\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 747 ---\n\nD.  Ranolazine\nRanolazine [ra-NOE-la-zeen] is an antianginal drug with antiarrhythmic properties similar to amiodarone. However,\nits main effect is to shorten repolarization and decrease the action potential duration similar to mexiletine. It is used\nto treat refractory atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, often in combination with other antiarrhythmic drugs. It is well\ntolerated with dizziness and constipation as the most common adverse effects. Ranolazine is extensively\nmetabolized in the liver by CYP3A and CYP2D6 isoenzymes and is mainly excreted by the kidney. Concomitant\nuse with strong CYP3A inducers or inhibitors is contraindicated.\n747\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 748 ---\n\n19.1\n19.2\n19.3\n19.4\n19.5\n19.6Study Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nA 60-year-old woman had a myocardial infarction. Which agent should be used to prevent life-threatening\narrhythmias that can occur post myocardial infarction in this patient?\nA.  Digoxin\nB.  Flecainide\nC.  Metoprolol\nD.  Procainamide\nCorrect answer = C. β-Blockers such as metoprolol prevent arrhythmias that occur subsequent to a myocardial\ninfarction. None of the other drugs has been shown to be effective in preventing postinfarct arrhythmias.\nFlecainide should be avoided in patients with structural heart disease.\nSuppression of arrhythmias resulting from a reentry focus is most likely to occur if the drug:\nA.  has vagomimetic effects on the AV node\nB.  is a β-blocker\nC.  converts a unidirectional block to a bidirectional block\nD.  slows conduction through the atria\nCorrect answer = C. Current theory holds that a reentrant arrhythmia is caused by damaged heart muscle, so that\nconduction is slowed through the damaged area in only one direction. A drug that prevents conduction in either\ndirection through the damaged area interrupts the reentrant arrhythmia. Class I antiarrhythmics, such as lidocaine,\nare capable of producing bidirectional block. The other choices do not have any direct effects on the direction of\nblockade of conduction through damaged cardiac muscle.\nA 57-year-old man is being treated for an atrial arrhythmia. He complains of dry mouth, blurred vision, and\nurinary hesitancy. Which antiarrhythmic drug is he mostly like taking?\nA.  Metoprolol\nB.  Disopyramide\nC.  Dronedarone\nD.  Sotalol\nCorrect answer = B. The clustered symptoms of dry mouth, blurred vision, and urinary hesitancy are\ncharacteristic of anticholinergic adverse effects, which are caused by class IA agents (in this case, disopyramide).\nThe other drugs do not cause anticholinergic effects.\nA 58-year-old woman is being treated for chronic suppression of a ventricular arrhythmia. After 1 week of\ntherapy, she complains of severe upset stomach and heartburn. Which antiarrhythmic drug is the likely cause\nof these symptoms?\nA.  Amiodarone\nB.  Digoxin\nC.  Mexiletine\nD.  Propranolol\nCorrect answer = C. The patient is exhibiting a classic adverse effect of mexiletine. None of the other agents\nlisted are likely to cause dyspepsia.\nA 78-year-old woman has been newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. She is not currently having\nsymptoms of palpitations or fatigue. Which is appropriate to initiate for rate control as an outpatient?\nA.  Dronedarone\nB.  Esmolol\nC.  Flecainide\nD.  Metoprolol\nCorrect answer = D. Only B and D are options to control rate. The other options are used for rhythm control in\npatients with atrial fibrillation. Since esmolol is IV only, the only option to start as an outpatient is metoprolol.\nWhich of the following is correct regarding digoxin when used for atrial fibrillation?\nA.  Digoxin works by blocking voltage-sensitive calcium channels.\nB.  Digoxin is used for rhythm control in patients with atrial fibrillation.\nC.  Digoxin increases conduction velocity through the AV node.\nD.  Digoxin levels of 1 to 2 ng/mL are desirable in the treatment of atrial fibrillation.\nCorrect answer = D. Digoxin works by inhibiting the Na+/K+-ATPase pump. It decreases conduction velocity\nthrough the AV node and is used for rate control in atrial fibrillation (not rhythm control). Digoxin levels between748\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 749 ---\n\n19.7\n19.8\n19.9\n19.101 and 2 ng/mL are more likely to exhibit negative chronotropic effects desired in atrial fibrillation or flutter. A\nserum drug concentration between 0.5 and 0.8 ng/mL is for symptomatic management of heart failure.\nAll of the following are adverse effects of amiodarone except:\nA.  Cinchonism\nB.  Hypothyroidism\nC.  Pulmonary fibrosis\nD.  Blue skin discoloration\nCorrect answer = A. Cinchonism is a constellation of symptoms (blurred vision, tinnitus, headache, psychosis)\nthat is known to occur with quinidine. All other options are adverse effects with amiodarone that require close\nmonitoring.\nWhich arrhythmia can be treated with lidocaine?\nA.  Paroxysmal supraventricular ventricular tachycardia\nB.  Atrial fibrillation\nC.  Atrial flutter\nD.  Ventricular tachycardia\nCorrect answer = D. Lidocaine has little effect on atrial or AV nodal tissue; thus, it used for ventricular\narrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia.\nA clinician would like to initiate a drug for rhythm control of atrial fibrillation. Which of the following\ncoexisting conditions would allow for initiation of flecainide?\nA.  Hypertension\nB.  Left ventricular hypertrophy\nC.  Coronary artery disease\nD.  Heart failure\nCorrect answer = A. Since flecainide can increase the risk of sudden cardiac death in those with a history of\nstructural heart disease, only coexisting hypertension will allow for flecainide initiation. Structural heart disease\nincludes left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, and atherosclerotic heart disease.\nWhich statement regarding dronedarone is correct?\nA.  Dronedarone is more effective than is amiodarone.\nB.  QT interval prolongation is not a risk with dronedarone.\nC.  Dronedarone increases the risk of death in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation or symptomatic heart\nfailure.\nD.  There is no need to monitor liver function with dronedarone.\nCorrect answer = C. Dronedarone is not as effective as amiodarone, QT prolongation is a risk with this drug, and\nliver function should be monitored when taking dronedarone since it increases the risk of liver failure. The drug is\ncontraindicated in those with symptomatic heart failure or permanent atrial fibrillation due to an increased risk of\ndeath.\n749\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 750 ---\n\n20\nAntianginal Drugs\nKristyn Pardo\n750\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 751 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nAtherosclerotic disease of the coronary arteries, also known as coronary artery disease (CAD) or ischemic heart\ndisease (IHD), is the most common cause of mortality worldwide. Atherosclerotic lesions in coronary arteries can\nobstruct blood flow, leading to an imbalance in myocardial oxygen supply and demand that presents as stable angina\nor an acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction [MI] or unstable angina). Spasms of vascular smooth muscle\nmay also impede cardiac blood flow, reducing perfusion and causing ischemia and angina pain. Typical angina\npectoris is a characteristic sudden, severe, crushing chest pain that may radiate to the neck, jaw, back, and arms. All\npatients with IHD and angina should receive guideline-directed medical therapy with emphasis on lifestyle\nmodifications (smoking cessation, physical activity, weight management) and management of modifiable risk\nfactors (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia) to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Medications used\nfor the management of stable angina are summarized in Figure 20.1.\nFigure 20.1 Summary of antianginal drugs.\n751\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 752 ---\n\nII.  Types of Angina\nAngina pectoris has three patterns: 1) stable, effort-induced, classic, or typical angina; 2) unstable angina; and 3)\nPrinzmetal, variant, vasospastic, or rest angina. They are caused by varying combinations of increased myocardial\noxygen demand and decreased myocardial perfusion.\n752\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 753 ---\n\nA.  Stable angina, effort-induced angina, classic or typical angina\nClassic or typical angina pectoris is the most common form of angina. It is usually characterized by a short-lasting\nburning, heavy, or squeezing feeling in the chest. Some ischemic episodes may present “atypically”—with extreme\nfatigue, nausea, or diaphoresis—while others may not be associated with any symptoms (silent angina). Atypical\npresentations are more common in women, diabetic patients, and the elderly.\nClassic angina is caused by the reduction of coronary perfusion due to a fixed obstruction of a coronary artery\nproduced by atherosclerosis. Increased myocardial oxygen demand, such as that produced by physical activity,\nemotional stress or excitement, or any other cause of increased cardiac workload (Figure 20.2), may induce\nischemia. Typical angina pectoris is promptly relieved by rest or nitroglycerin [nye-troe-GLIS-er-in]. When the\npattern of chest pain and the amount of effort needed to trigger the chest pain does not vary over time, the angina is\nnamed “stable angina.”\n753\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 754 ---\n\n754\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 755 ---\n\nFigure 20.2 Blood flow in a coronary artery partially blocked with atherosclerotic\nplaques.\n755\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 756 ---\n\nB.  Unstable angina\nUnstable angina is chest pain that occurs with increased frequency, duration, and intensity and can be precipitated by\nprogressively less effort. Any episode of rest angina longer than 20 minutes, any new-onset angina, any increasing\n(crescendo) angina, or even sudden development of shortness of breath is suggestive of unstable angina. The\nsymptoms are not relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. Unstable angina is a form of acute coronary syndrome and\nrequires hospital admission and more aggressive therapy to prevent progression to MI and death.\n756\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 757 ---\n\nC.  Prinzmetal, variant, vasospastic, or rest angina\nPrinzmetal angina is an uncommon pattern of episodic angina that occurs at rest and is due to decreased blood flow\nto the heart muscle caused by spasm of the coronary arteries. Although individuals with this form of angina may\nhave significant coronary atherosclerosis, the angina attacks are unrelated to physical activity, heart rate, or blood\npressure. Prinzmetal angina generally responds promptly to coronary vasodilators, such as nitroglycerin and calcium\nchannel blockers.\n757\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 758 ---\n\nD.  Acute coronary syndrome\nAcute coronary syndrome is an emergency that commonly results from rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque and\npartial or complete thrombosis of a coronary artery. If the thrombus occludes most of the blood vessel, and, if the\nocclusion is untreated, necrosis of the cardiac muscle may ensue. MI (necrosis) is typified by increases in the serum\nlevels of biomarkers such as troponins and creatine kinase. The acute coronary syndrome may present as ST-\nsegment elevation myocardial infarction, non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, or as unstable angina.\n[Note: In unstable angina, increases in biomarkers of myocardial necrosis are not present.]\n758\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 759 ---\n\nIII.  Treatment Strategies\nFour types of drugs, used either alone or in combination, are commonly used to manage patients with stable angina:\nβ-blockers, calcium channel blockers, organic nitrates, and the sodium channel–blocking drug, ranolazine (Figure\n20.1). These agents help to balance the cardiac oxygen supply and demand equation by affecting blood pressure,\nvenous return, heart rate, and contractility. Figure 20.3 summarizes the treatment of angina in patients with\nconcomitant diseases, and Figure 20.4 provides a treatment algorithm for patients with stable angina.\nFigure 20.3 Treatment of angina in patients with concomitant diseases. COPD = chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disease.\nFigure 20.4 Treatment algorithm for improving symptoms in patients with stable angina.\n759\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 760 ---\n\nIV.  β-Adrenergic Blockers\nThe β-adrenergic blockers decrease the oxygen demands of the myocardium by blocking β1 receptors, resulting in\ndecreased heart rate, contractility, cardiac output, and blood pressure. These agents reduce myocardial oxygen\ndemand during exertion and at rest. As such, they can reduce both the frequency and severity of angina attacks. β-\nBlockers can be used to increase exercise duration and tolerance in patients with effort-induced angina. β-Blockers\nare recommended as initial antianginal therapy in all patients unless contraindicated. [Note: The exception to this\nrule is vasospastic angina, in which β-blockers are ineffective and may actually worsen symptoms.] β-Blockers\nreduce the risk of death and MI in patients who have had a prior MI and also improve mortality in patients with\nheart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Agents with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) such as pindolol\nshould be avoided in patients with angina and those with a history of MI. Propranolol  is the prototype for this class\nof compounds, but it is not cardioselective (see",

Nonselective β-\nblockers should be avoided in patients with asthma. [Note: It is important not to discontinue β-blocker therapy\nabruptly. The dose should be gradually tapered off over 2 to 3 weeks to avoid rebound angina, MI, and\nhypertension.]\n760\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 761 ---\n\nV.  Calcium Channel Blockers\nCalcium is essential for muscular contraction. Calcium influx is increased in ischemia because of the membrane\ndepolarization that hypoxia produces. In turn, this promotes the activity of several ATP-consuming enzymes,\nthereby depleting energy stores and worsening the ischemia. The calcium channel blockers protect the tissue by\ninhibiting the entrance of calcium into cardiac and smooth muscle cells of the coronary and systemic arterial beds.\nAll calcium channel blockers are, therefore, arteriolar vasodilators that cause a decrease in smooth muscle tone and\nvascular resistance. These agents primarily affect the resistance of peripheral and coronary arteriolar smooth muscle.\nIn the treatment of effort-induced angina, calcium channel blockers reduce myocardial oxygen consumption by\ndecreasing vascular resistance, thereby decreasing afterload. Their efficacy in vasospastic angina is due to relaxation\nof the coronary arteries. [Note: Verapamil  mainly affects the myocardium, whereas amlodipine exerts a greater\neffect on smooth muscle in the peripheral vasculature. Diltiazem is intermediate in its actions.] All calcium channel\nblockers lower blood pressure.\n761\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 762 ---\n\nA.  Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers\nAmlodipine [am-LOE-di-peen], an oral dihydropyridine, has minimal effect on cardiac conduction and functions\nmainly as an arteriolar vasodilator. The vasodilatory effect of amlodipine is useful in the treatment of variant angina\ncaused by spontaneous coronary spasm. Nifedipine [ni-FED-i-pine] is another agent in this class; it is usually\nadministered as an extended-release oral formulation. [Note: Short-acting dihydropyridines should be avoided in\nCAD because of evidence of increased mortality after an MI and an increase in acute MI in hypertensive patients.]\n762\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 763 ---\n\nB.  Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers\nVerapamil  [ver-AP-a-mil] slows atrioventricular (AV) conduction directly and decreases heart rate, contractility,\nblood pressure, and oxygen demand. Verapamil  has greater negative inotropic effects than amlodipine, but it is a\nweaker vasodilator. Verapamil  is contraindicated in patients with preexisting depressed cardiac function or AV\nconduction abnormalities. Diltiazem [dil-TYE-a-zem] also slows AV conduction, decreases the rate of firing of the\nsinus node pacemaker, and is also a coronary artery vasodilator. Diltiazem can relieve coronary artery spasm and is\nparticularly useful in patients with variant angina. Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers can worsen heart\nfailure due to their negative inotropic effect, and their use should be avoided in this population.\n763\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 764 ---\n\nVI.  Organic Nitrates\nThese compounds cause a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand, followed by relief of symptoms. They are\neffective in stable, unstable, and variant angina.\n764\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 765 ---\n\nA.  Mechanism of action\nOrganic nitrates relax vascular smooth muscle by their intracellular conversion to nitrite ions and then to nitric\noxide, which in turn activates guanylate cyclase and increases synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate\n(cGMP). Elevated cGMP ultimately leads to dephosphorylation of the myosin light chain, resulting in vascular\nsmooth muscle relaxation (Figure 20.5). Nitrates such as nitroglycerin cause dilation of the large veins, which\nreduces preload (venous return to the heart) and, therefore, reduces the work of the heart. Nitrates also dilate the\ncoronary vasculature, providing an increased blood supply to the heart muscle.\nFigure 20.5 Effects of nitrates and nitrites on smooth muscle. cGMP = cyclic guanosine\n3′,5′-monophosphate.\n765\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 766 ---\n\nB.  Pharmacokinetics\nNitrates differ in their onset of action and rate of elimination. The onset of action varies from 1 minute for\nnitroglycerin to 30 minutes for isosorbide [eye-soe-SOR-bide] mononitrate (Figure 20.6). Sublingual nitroglycerin,\navailable in tablet or spray formulation, is the drug of choice for prompt relief of an angina attack precipitated by\nexercise or emotional stress. All patients should have nitroglycerin on hand to treat acute angina attacks. Significant\nfirst-pass metabolism of nitroglycerin occurs in the liver. Therefore, it is commonly administered via the sublingual\nor transdermal route (patch or ointment), thereby avoiding the hepatic first-pass effect. Isosorbide mononitrate owes\nits improved bioavailability and long duration of action to its stability against hepatic breakdown. Oral isosorbide\ndinitrate undergoes denitration to two mononitrates, both of which possess antianginal activity.\n766\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 767 ---\n\n767\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 768 ---\n\nFigure 20.6 Time to peak effect and duration of action for some common organic nitrate\npreparations.\n768\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 769 ---\n\nC.  Adverse effects\nHeadache is the most common adverse effect of nitrates. High doses of nitrates can also cause postural hypotension,\nfacial flushing, and tachycardia. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors such as sildenafil  potentiate the action of the\nnitrates. To preclude the dangerous hypotension that may occur, this combination is contraindicated.\nTolerance to the actions of nitrates develops rapidly as the blood vessels become desensitized to vasodilation.\nTolerance can be overcome by providing a daily “nitrate-free interval” to restore sensitivity to the drug. The nitrate-\nfree interval of 10 to 12 hours is usually taken at night when myocardial oxygen demand is decreased. However,\nvariant angina worsens early in the morning, perhaps due to circadian catecholamine surges. Therefore, the nitrate-\nfree interval in patients with variant angina should occur in the late afternoon. Nitroglycerin patches are worn for 12\nhours and then removed for 12 hours to provide the nitrate-free interval.\n769\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 770 ---\n\nVII.  Sodium Channel Blocker\nRanolazine [ra-NOE-la-zeen] inhibits the late phase of the sodium current (late INa), improving the oxygen supply\nand demand equation. Inhibition of late INa reduces intracellular sodium and calcium overload, thereby improving\ndiastolic function. Ranolazine has antianginal as well as antiarrhythmic properties. It is most often used in patients\nwho have failed other antianginal therapies. The antianginal effects of ranolazine are considerably less in women\nthan in men. The reason for this difference in effect is unknown. Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the liver,\nmainly by the CYP3A family and also by CYP2D6. It is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. As such, ranolazine is\nsubject to numerous drug interactions. In addition, ranolazine can prolong the QT interval and should be avoided\nwith other drugs that cause QT prolongation.\nFigure 20.7 provides a summary of characteristics of the antianginal drugs.\nFigure 20.7 Summary of characteristics of antianginal drugs. CYP = cytochrome P450;\nISA = intrinsic sympathomimetic activity; PDE5 = phosphodiesterase type 5.\n770\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 771 ---\n\n20.1\n20.2\n20.3\n20.4\n20.5\n20.6\n20.7Study Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\n20.1Which of the following best describes stable angina?\nA.  Angina that occurs more frequently or with progressively less exercise or stress than before\nB.  Angina due to spasm of coronary arteries\nC.  Angina due to increased myocardial demand which is reproducible and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin\nD.  Angina pain accompanied by increases in serum biomarkers of myocardial necrosis\nCorrect answer = C. When the pattern of the chest pain and the amount of effort needed to trigger the chest pain\ndoes not vary over time, the angina is named “stable angina.”\n20.2Which medication should be prescribed to all angina patients to treat an acute attack?\nA.  Isosorbide dinitrate\nB.  Nitroglycerin patch\nC.  Nitroglycerin sublingual tablet or spray\nD.  Ranolazine\nCorrect answer = C. The other options will not provide prompt relief of angina and should not be used to treat an\nacute attack.\n20.3Which of the following instructions is important to communicate to a patient receiving a prescription for\nthe nitroglycerin patch?\nA.  Apply the patch at onset of angina symptoms for quick relief.\nB.  Remove the old patch after 24 hours of use, then immediately apply the next patch to prevent any breakthrough\nangina pain.\nC.  Do not use sublingual nitroglycerin in combination with the patch.\nD.  Have a nitrate-free interval of 10 to 12 hours every day to prevent development of nitrate tolerance.\nCorrect answer = D. Nitrate-free intervals help prevent the development of nitrate tolerance. Sublingual\nnitroglycerin should be used to treat breakthrough angina due to its quick onset of action; transdermal\nnitroglycerin has a delayed onset of action.\n20.4A 64-year-old man was prescribed atenolol and sublingual nitroglycerin after his recent hospitalization\nfor unstable angina. Which of his current medications should be discontinued?\nA.  Sildenafil\nB.  Amlodipine\nC.  Metformin\nD.  Lisinopril\nCorrect answer = A. Sildenafil and other PDE-5 inhibitors can potentiate the vasodilator effects of nitrates and\ncause an unsafe drop in blood pressure. Concomitant use of nitrates and PDE-5 inhibitors should be avoided.\n20.5Which of the following correctly ranks the calcium channel blockers from most active on the\nmyocardium to most peripherally active?\nA.  Diltiazem, amlodipine, verapamil\nB.  Verapamil, diltiazem, nifedipine\nC.  Nifedipine, verapamil, diltiazem\nD.  Amlodipine, diltiazem, verapamil\nCorrect answer = B. Verapamil has the most negative inotropic effects, nifedipine is a peripheral vasodilator, and\ndiltiazem is intermediate with actions on both myocardial and peripheral calcium channels.\n20.6A 76-year-old man with uncontrolled hypertension is experiencing typical angina pain that is relieved\nwith rest and sublingual nitroglycerin. He has a high blood pressure (178/92 mm Hg) and a low heart rate (54\nbpm). Which is the most appropriate therapy for his angina at this time?\nA.  Ranolazine\nB.  Verapamil\nC.  Metoprolol\nD.  Amlodipine\nCorrect answer = D. Amlodipine is the best choice because it will improve angina as well as help control blood\npressure, without further reducing the heart rate. Adding verapamil or metoprolol may worsen the bradycardia.\nRanolazine may help the angina, but it will not improve the hypertension.\n20.7A 65-year-old male experiences uncontrolled angina attacks that limit his ability to do household chores.771\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 772 ---\n\n20.8\n20.9\n20.10He is adherent to a maximized dose of β-blocker with a low heart rate and low blood pressure. He is unable\nto tolerate an increase in isosorbide mononitrate due to headache. Which is the most appropriate addition to\nhis antianginal therapy?\nA.  Nifedipine\nB.  Aspirin\nC.  Ranolazine\nD.  Verapamil\nCorrect answer = C. Ranolazine is the best answer. The patient’s blood pressure is low, and verapamil and\nnifedipine may drop blood pressure further. Verapamil may also decrease heart rate. Ranolazine can be used\nwhen other agents are maximized, especially when blood pressure is well controlled. The patient will need a\nbaseline ECG and lab work to ensure safe use of this medication.\n20.8A 62-year-old man with ischemic heart disease complains of angina pain that has been getting\nprogressively worse over the past 30 minutes despite use of nitroglycerin. Which of the following is the best\ncourse of action?\nA.  Change nitroglycerin to a long-acting nitrate.\nB.  Initiate metoprolol .\nC.  Initiate ranolazine.\nD.  Refer him to the nearest emergency department for immediate evaluation.\nCorrect answer = C. Crescendo angina is indicative of unstable angina that requires immediate evaluation.\n20.9Which is correct regarding antianginal therapy in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection\nfraction?\nA.  β-Blockers have been associated with reduced mortality.\nB.  Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should be avoided.\nC.  β-Blockers with ISA are preferred over those without ISA.\nD.  Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should be used in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection\nfraction who cannot tolerate β-blockers.\nCorrect answer = A. β-Blockers have been shown to reduce mortality in heart failure with reduced ejection\nfraction, but β-blockers with ISA should be avoided in these patients. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers\ncan be used in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, but nondihydropyridine calcium channel\nblockers should be avoided due to negative inotropic effects.\n20.10A 45-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes has been diagnosed with Prinzmetal angina. Which of the\nfollowing is correct regarding management of angina in this patient?\nA.  β-Blockers are the treatment of choice but should be avoided because of her diabetes.\nB.  Nitroglycerin is not beneficial for this type of angina.\nC.  She should be counseled to take nitroglycerin before physical activity to prevent symptoms.\nD.  Felodipine will be more effective than verapamil .\nCorrect answer = D. Prinzmetal or vasospastic angina responds well to vasodilators, including the\ndihydropyridine calcium channel blocker felodipine. Verapamil is a weak vasodilator. Beta-blockers may be used\nwith caution in patients with diabetes, but these drugs are less effective options for Prinzmetal angina. Nitrates are\nalso effective, but Prinzmetal angina is provoked by coronary artery vasospasm rather than physical activity.\n772\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 773 ---\n\n21\nAnticoagulants and Antiplatelet Agents\nKatherine Vogel Anderson and Kaylie Smith\n773\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 774 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nThis chapter describes drugs that are useful in the treatment of disorders of hemostasis. Thrombosis, the formation\nof an unwanted clot within a blood vessel, is the most common abnormality of hemostasis. Thrombotic disorders\ninclude acute myocardial infarction (MI), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and acute\nischemic stroke. These conditions are treated with drugs such as anticoagulants and fibrinolytics. Bleeding disorders\nrelated to the failure of hemostasis are less common than thromboembolic disorders. Bleeding disorders include\nhemophilia, which is treated with transfusion of recombinant factor VIII, and vitamin K deficiency, which is treated\nwith vitamin K supplementation. Figure 21.1 summarizes agents used for the treatment of dysfunctions of\nhemostasis.\n774\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 775 ---\n\nFigure 21.1 Summary of drugs used in treating dysfunctions of hemostasis.\n775\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 776 ---\n\n776\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 777 ---\n\nII.  Thrombus Versus Embolus\nA clot that adheres to a vessel wall is called a “thrombus,” whereas an intravascular clot that floats in the blood is\ntermed an “embolus.” Thus, a detached thrombus becomes an embolus. Both thrombi and emboli are dangerous,\nbecause they may occlude blood vessels and deprive tissues of oxygen and nutrients. Arterial thrombosis most often\noccurs in medium-sized vessels rendered thrombogenic by atherosclerosis. Arterial thrombosis usually consists of a\nplatelet-rich clot. In contrast, venous thrombosis is triggered by blood stasis or inappropriate activation of the\ncoagulation cascade. Venous thrombosis typically involves a clot that is rich in fibrin, with fewer platelets than are\nobserved with arterial clots.\n777\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 778 ---\n\nIII.  Platelet Response to Vascular Injury\nPhysical trauma to the vascular system, such as a puncture or a cut, initiates a complex series of interactions between\nplatelets, endothelial cells, and the coagulation cascade. These interactions lead to hemostasis or the cessation of\nblood loss from a damaged blood vessel. Platelets are central in this process. Initially, there is vasospasm of the\ndamaged blood vessel to prevent further blood loss. The next step involves the formation of a platelet–fibrin plug at\nthe site of the puncture. The creation of an unwanted thrombus involves many of the same steps as normal clot\nformation, except that the triggering stimulus is a pathologic condition in the vascular system, rather than external\nphysical trauma.\n778\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 779 ---\n\nA.  Resting platelets\nPlatelets act as vascular sentries, monitoring the integrity of the vascular endothelium. In the absence of injury,\nresting platelets circulate freely, because the balance of chemical signals indicates that the vascular system is not\ndamaged (Figure 21.2).\n779\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 780 ---\n\nFigure 21.2 Formation of a hemostatic plug. GP = glycoprotein; ATP = adenosine\ntriphosphate; cAMP = cyclic adenosine monophosphate; (Figure continues on next\npage)Figure 21.2 (continued)ADP = adenosine diphosphate; PAF = platelet activation\nfactor.\n1.  Chemical mediators synthesized by endothelial cells\nProstacyclin is synthesized by intact endothelial cells and acts as an inhibitor of platelet aggregation. Prostacyclin\n(also known as prostaglandin I2) binds to platelet membrane receptors that are coupled to the synthesis of cyclic\nadenosine monophosphate (cAMP), an intracellular messenger (Figure 21.2). Elevated levels of intracellular cAMP\nare associated with a decrease in intracellular calcium. Decreased intracellular calcium prevents platelet activation\nand the subsequent release of platelet aggregation agents. Damaged endothelial cells synthesize less prostacyclin\nthan healthy cells. With less prostacyclin to bind platelet receptors, less intracellular cAMP is synthesized; this leads\nto platelet aggregation.\n2.  Roles of thrombin, thromboxanes, and collagen\nThe platelet membrane also contains receptors that can bind thrombin, thromboxanes, and exposed collagen. In the\nintact, normal vessel, circulating levels of thrombin and thromboxane are low, and the intact endothelium covers\ncollagen in the subendothelial layers. The corresponding platelet receptors are, thus, unoccupied, and as a result,\nplatelet activation and aggregation are not initiated. However, when occupied, each of these receptor types triggers a\nseries of reactions leading to the release into the circulation of intracellular granules by the platelets. This ultimately\nstimulates platelet aggregation.780\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 781 ---\n\n781\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 782 ---\n\nB.  Platelet adhesion\nWhen the endothelium is injured, platelets adhere to and virtually cover the exposed collagen of the subendothelium\n(Figure 21.2). This triggers a complex series of chemical reactions, resulting in platelet activation.\n782\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 783 ---\n\nC.  Platelet activation\nReceptors on the surface of the adhering platelets are activated by the collagen of the underlying connective tissue.\nThis causes morphologic changes in platelets (Figure 21.3) and the release of platelet granules containing chemical\nmediators, such as adenosine diphosphate (ADP), thromboxane A2, serotonin, platelet activation factor, and\nthrombin (Figure 21.2). These signaling molecules bind to receptors in the outer membrane of resting platelets\ncirculating nearby. These receptors function as sensors that are activated by the signals sent from the adhering\nplatelets. The previously dormant platelets become activated and start to aggregate. These actions are mediated by\nseveral messenger systems that ultimately result in elevated levels of calcium and a decreased concentration of\ncAMP within the platelet.\nFigure 21.3 Scanning electron micrograph of platelets.\n783\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 784 ---\n\nD.  Platelet aggregation\nThe increase in cytosolic calcium accompanying activation is due to a release of sequestered stores within the\nplatelet (Figure 21.2). This leads to 1) the release of platelet granules containing mediators, such as ADP and\nserotonin that activate other platelets; 2) activation of thromboxane A2 synthesis; and 3) activation of glycoprotein\n(GP) IIb/IIIa receptors that bind fibrinogen and, ultimately, regulate platelet–platelet interaction and thrombus\nformation. Fibrinogen, a soluble plasma GP, simultaneously binds to GP IIb/IIIa receptors on two separate platelets,\nresulting in platelet cross-linking and platelet aggregation. This leads to an avalanche of platelet aggregation,\nbecause each activated platelet can recruit other platelets (Figure 21.4).\nFigure 21.4 Activation and aggregation of platelets. GP = glycoprotein.\n784\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 785 ---\n\nE.  Formation of a clot\nLocal stimulation of the coagulation cascade by tissue factors released from the injured tissue and by mediators on\nthe surface of platelets results in the formation of thrombin (factor IIa). In turn, thrombin, a serine protease,\ncatalyzes the hydrolysis of fibrinogen to fibrin, which is incorporated into the clot. Subsequent cross-linking of the\nfibrin strands stabilizes the clot and forms a hemostatic platelet–fibrin plug (Figure 21.2).\n785\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 786 ---\n\nF.  Fibrinolysis\nDuring clot formation, the fibrinolytic pathway is locally activated. Plasminogen is enzymatically processed to\nplasmin (fibrinolysin) by plasminogen activators in the tissue (Figure 21.2). Plasmin limits the growth of the clot\nand dissolves the fibrin network as wounds heal.\n786\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 787 ---\n\nIV.  Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors\nPlatelet aggregation inhibitors decrease the formation of a platelet-rich clot or decrease the action of chemical\nsignals that promote platelet aggregation (Figure 21.5). The platelet aggregation inhibitors described below inhibit\ncyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), block GP IIb/IIIa, or block ADP receptors, thereby interfering with the signals that\npromote platelet aggregation. These agents are beneficial in the prevention and treatment of occlusive cardiovascular\ndiseases, in the maintenance of vascular grafts and arterial patency, and as adjuncts to thrombin inhibitors or\nthrombolytic therapy in MI.\nFigure 21.5 Summary of characteristics of platelet aggregation inhibitors. APTT =\nactivated partial thromboplastin time, CBC = complete blood count, GI = gastrointestinal,\nH/H = hemoglobin and hematocrit, LFT = liver function test, NSAID = nonsteroidal anti-\ninflammatory drug, SCr = serum creatinine, SJS = Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, SNRI =\nserotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, SSRI = selective serotonin reuptake\ninhibitor.\n787\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 788 ---\n\nA.  Aspirin\n1.  Mechanism of action\nStimulation of platelets by thrombin, collagen, and ADP results in activation of platelet membrane phospholipases\nthat liberate arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids. Arachidonic acid is first converted to prostaglandin H2\nby COX-1 (Figure 21.6). Prostaglandin H2 is further metabolized to thromboxane A2, which is released into plasma.\nThromboxane A2 promotes the aggregation process that is essential for the rapid formation of a hemostatic plug.\nAspirin [AS-pir-in] inhibits thromboxane A2 synthesis by acetylation of a serine residue on the active site of COX-1,\nthereby irreversibly inactivating the enzyme (Figure 21.7). This shifts the balance of chemical mediators to favor the\nantiaggregatory effects of prostacyclin, thereby preventing platelet aggregation. The inhibitory effect is rapid, and\naspirin-induced suppression of thromboxane A2 and the resulting suppression of platelet aggregation last for the life\nof the platelet, which is approximately 7 to 10 days. Repeated administration of aspirin has a cumulative effect on\nthe function of platelets. Aspirin is the only antiplatelet agent that irreversibly inhibits platelet function.\nFigure 21.6 Aspirin irreversibly inhibits platelet cyclooxygenase-1.\n788\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 789 ---\n\nFigure 21.7 Acetylation of cyclooxygenase-1 by aspirin.\n2.  Therapeutic use\nAspirin is used in the prophylactic treatment of transient cerebral ischemia, to reduce the incidence of recurrent MI,\nand to decrease mortality in the setting of primary and secondary prevention of MI. Complete inactivation of\nplatelets occurs with 75 mg of aspirin given daily. The recommended antiplatelet dose of aspirin ranges from 50 to\n325 mg daily.\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\nWhen given orally, aspirin is absorbed by passive diffusion and quickly hydrolyzed to salicylic acid in the liver.\nSalicylic acid is further metabolized in the liver and some is excreted unchanged in the urine. The half-life of aspirin\nranges from 15 to 20 minutes and for salicylic acid is 3 to 12 hours.\n4.  Adverse effects\nHigher doses of aspirin increase drug-related toxicities as well as the probability that aspirin may also inhibit\nprostacyclin production. Bleeding time is prolonged by aspirin treatment, causing complications that include an\nincreased incidence of hemorrhagic stroke and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially at higher doses of the drug.\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, inhibit COX-1 by transiently competing at the catalytic\n789\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 790 ---\n\nsite. Ibuprofen, if taken within the 2 hours prior to aspirin, can obstruct the access of aspirin to the serine residue\nand, thereby, antagonize platelet inhibition by aspirin. Therefore, immediate-release aspirin should be taken at least\n60 minutes before or at least 8 hours after ibuprofen.\n790\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 791 ---\n\nB.  P2Y 12 receptor antagonists\nTiclopidine [ti-KLOE-pi-deen], clopidogrel  [kloh-PID-oh-grel], prasugrel  [PRA-soo-grel], ticagrelor [tye-KA-grel-\nor], and cangrelor [KAN-grel-or] are P2Y12 ADP receptor inhibitors that also block platelet aggregation but by a\nmechanism different from that of aspirin. All of these agents are administered orally, with the exception of\ncangrelor, which is an injectable formulation.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nThese drugs inhibit the binding of ADP to the P2Y12 receptor on platelets and, thereby, inhibit the activation of the\nGP IIb/IIIa receptors required for platelets to bind to fibrinogen and to each other (Figure 21.8). Ticagrelor and\ncangrelor bind to the P2Y12 ADP receptor in a reversible manner. The other agents bind irreversibly. The maximum\ninhibition of platelet aggregation is achieved in 2 minutes with intravenous (IV) cangrelor, 1 to 3 hours with\nticagrelor, 2 to 4 hours with prasugrel , 3 to 4 days with ticlopidine, and 3 to 5 days with clopidogrel . When\ntreatment is suspended, the platelet system requires time to recover.\nFigure 21.8 Mechanism of action of P2Y12 receptor antagonists. ADP = adenine\ndiphosphate; GP = glycoprotein.\n2.  Therapeutic use\nClopidogrel  is approved for prevention of atherosclerotic events in patients with a recent MI or stroke and in those\nwith established peripheral arterial disease. It is also approved for prophylaxis of thrombotic events in acute\ncoronary syndromes (unstable angina or non–ST-elevation MI). Additionally, clopidogrel  is used to prevent\nthrombotic events associated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with or without coronary stenting.\nTiclopidine is similar in structure to clopidogrel . It is indicated for the prevention of transient ischemic attacks (TIA)\nand strokes in patients with a prior cerebral thrombotic event. However, due to life-threatening hematologic adverse\nreactions, ticlopidine is generally reserved for patients who are intolerant to other therapies. Prasugrel  is approved\nto decrease thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina, non–ST-\nelevation MI, and ST-elevation MI managed with PCI). Ticagrelor is approved for the prevention of arterial\nthromboembolism in patients with unstable angina and acute MI, including those undergoing PCI. Cangrelor is\napproved as an adjunct during PCI to reduce thrombotic events in select patients.\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\nThese agents require oral loading doses for quicker antiplatelet effect, except cangrelor that has a fast onset of791\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 792 ---\n\naction with intravenous administration. Food interferes with the absorption of ticlopidine but not with the other\nagents. After oral ingestion, the drugs are extensively bound to plasma proteins. They undergo hepatic metabolism\nby the cytochrome P-450 (CYP) system to active metabolites. Elimination of the drugs and metabolites occurs by\nboth the renal and fecal routes. Clopidogrel  is a prodrug, and its therapeutic efficacy relies on its active metabolite,\nwhich is produced via metabolism by CYP 2C19. Genetic polymorphism of CYP 2C19 leads to a reduced clinical\nresponse in patients who are “poor metabolizers” of clopidogrel . Tests are currently available to identify poor\nmetabolizers, and it is recommended that other antiplatelet agents (prasugrel  or ticagrelor) be prescribed for these\npatients. In addition, other drugs that inhibit CYP 2C19, such as omeprazole and esomeprazole, should be avoided\nwhile on clopidogrel .\n4.  Adverse effects\nThese agents can cause prolonged bleeding for which there is no antidote. Ticlopidine is associated with severe\nhematologic reactions that limit its use, such as agranulocytosis, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), and\naplastic anemia. Clopidogrel  causes fewer adverse reactions, and the incidence of neutropenia is lower. However,\nTTP has been reported as an adverse effect for both clopidogrel  and prasugrel  (but not for ticagrelor). Prasugrel  is\ncontraindicated in patients with history of TIA or stroke. Prasugrel , ticagrelor, and cangrelor carry black box\nwarnings for bleeding. Additionally, ticagrelor carries a black box warning for diminished effectiveness with\nconcomitant use of aspirin doses above 100 mg.\n792\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 793 ---\n\nC.  Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors\n1.  Mechanism of action\nThe GP IIb/IIIa receptor plays a key role in stimulating platelet aggregation. A chimeric monoclonal antibody\nfragment, abciximab [ab-SIKS-eh-mab], inhibits the GP IIb/IIIa receptor complex. By binding to GP IIb/IIIa,\nabciximab blocks the binding of fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor and, consequently, aggregation does not\noccur (Figure 21.9). Eptifibatide [ep-ti-FIB-ih-tide] and tirofiban [tye-roe-FYE-ban] act similarly to abciximab, by\nblocking the GP IIb/IIIa receptor. Eptifibatide is a cyclic peptide that binds to GP IIb/IIIa at the site that interacts\nwith the arginine–glycine–aspartic acid sequence of fibrinogen. Tirofiban is not a peptide, but it blocks the same site\nas eptifibatide.\nFigure 21.9 Mechanism of action of glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor blockers.\n2.  Therapeutic use\nThese agents are given intravenously, along with heparin and aspirin, as an adjunct to PCI for the prevention of\ncardiac ischemic complications. Abciximab is also approved for patients with unstable angina not responding to\nconventional medical therapy when PCI is planned within 24 hours.\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\nAbciximab is given by IV bolus, followed by IV infusion, achieving peak platelet inhibition within 30 minutes. The\nmetabolism of abciximab is unknown. After cessation of abciximab infusion, platelet function gradually returns to\nnormal, with the antiplatelet effect persisting for 24 to 48 hours. When IV infusion of eptifibatide or tirofiban is\nstopped, both agents are rapidly cleared from the plasma. Eptifibatide and its metabolites are excreted by the kidney.\nTirofiban is excreted largely unchanged by the kidney and to a lesser extent in the feces.\n793\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 794 ---\n\n4.  Adverse effects\nThe major adverse effect of these agents is bleeding, especially if used with anticoagulants.\n794\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 795 ---\n\nD.  Dipyridamole\nDipyridamole [dye-peer-ID-a-mole], a coronary vasodilator, increases intracellular levels of cAMP by inhibiting\nphosphodiesterase, thereby resulting in decreased thromboxane A2 synthesis. The drug may potentiate the effect of\nprostacyclin and, therefore, decrease platelet adhesion to thrombogenic surfaces (Figure 21.2). Dipyridamole is used\nfor stroke prevention and is usually given in combination with aspirin. Dipyridamole has variable bioavailability\nfollowing oral administration. It is highly protein bound. The drug undergoes hepatic metabolism, mainly\nglucuronidation, and is excreted primarily in the feces. Patients with unstable angina should not use dipyridamole\nbecause of its vasodilating properties, which may worsen ischemia (coronary steal phenomenon). Dipyridamole\ncommonly causes headache and dizziness and can lead to orthostatic hypotension (especially if administered IV).\n795\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 796 ---\n\nE.  Cilostazol\nCilostazol  [sill-AH-sta-zole] is an oral antiplatelet agent that also has vasodilating activity. Cilostazol  and its active\nmetabolites inhibit phosphodiesterase type III, which prevents the degradation of cAMP, thereby increasing levels of\ncAMP in platelets and vascular tissues. The increase in cAMP prevents platelet aggregation and promotes\nvasodilation of blood vessels, respectively. Cilostazol  is approved to reduce the symptoms of intermittent\nclaudication. Cilostazol  is extensively metabolized in the liver by the CYP 3A4 and 2C19 isoenzymes. As such, this\nagent has many drug interactions that require dose modification. The primary route of elimination is via the kidney.\nHeadache and GI side effects (diarrhea, abnormal stools, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain) are the most common\nadverse effects observed with cilostazol . Rarely, thrombocytopenia or leukopenia has been reported.\nPhosphodiesterase type III inhibitors have been shown to increase mortality in patients with advanced heart failure.\nAs such, cilostazol  is contraindicated in patients with heart failure.\n796\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 797 ---\n\nV.  Blood Coagulation\nThe coagulation process that generates thrombin consists of two interrelated pathways, the extrinsic and the intrinsic\nsystems. The extrinsic system is initiated by the activation of clotting factor VII by tissue factor (also known as\nthromboplastin). Tissue factor is a membrane protein that is normally separated from the blood by the endothelial\ncells that line the vasculature. However, in response to vascular injury, tissue factor becomes exposed to blood.\nThere, it can bind and activate factor VII, initiating the extrinsic pathway. The intrinsic system is triggered by the\nactivation of clotting factor XII. This occurs when blood comes into contact with the collagen in the damaged wall\nof a blood vessel.\n797\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 798 ---\n\nA.  Formation of fibrin\nBoth the extrinsic and the intrinsic systems involve a cascade of enzyme reactions that sequentially transform\nvarious plasma factors (proenzymes) to their active (enzymatic) forms. [Note: The active form of a clotting factor is\ndenoted by the letter “a.”] Ultimately, factor Xa is produced, which converts prothrombin (factor II) to thrombin\n(factor IIa; Figure 21.10).Thrombin plays a key role in coagulation, because it is responsible for generation of fibrin,\nwhich forms the mesh-like matrix of the blood clot. If thrombin is not formed or if its function is impeded (for\nexample, by antithrombin III), coagulation is inhibited.\nFigure 21.10 Formation of a fibrin clot.\n798\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 799 ---\n\n799\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 800 ---\n\nB.  Inhibitors of coagulation\nIt is important that coagulation is restricted to the local site of vascular injury. Endogenously, protein C, protein S,\nantithrombin III, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor all inhibit coagulation factors. The mechanism of action of\nseveral anticoagulant agents, including heparin and heparin-related products, involves activation of these\nendogenous inhibitors (primarily antithrombin III).\n800\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 801 ---\n\nVI.  Parenteral Anticoagulants\nThe anticoagulant drugs inhibit either the action of the coagulation factors (for example, heparin) or interfere with\nthe synthesis of the coagulation factors (warfarin).\n801\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 802 ---\n\nA.  Heparin and low molecular weight heparins\nHeparin [HEP-a-rin] is an injectable, rapidly acting anticoagulant that is often used acutely to interfere with the\nformation of thrombi. Heparin occurs naturally as a macromolecule complexed with histamine in mast cells, where\nits physiologic role is unknown. It is extracted for commercial use from porcine intestinal mucosa. Unfractionated\nheparin is a mixture of straight-chain, anionic glycosaminoglycans with a wide range of molecular weights. It is\nstrongly acidic because of the presence of sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. The realization that low molecular\nweight forms of heparin (LMWHs) can also act as anticoagulants led to the isolation of enoxaparin [e-NOX-a-par-\nin] and dalteparin [DAL-te-PAR-in], produced by depolymerization of unfractionated heparin. The LMWHs are\nheterogeneous compounds about one-third the size of unfractionated heparin.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nHeparin acts at a number of molecular targets, but its anticoagulant effect is a consequence of binding to\nantithrombin III, with the subsequent rapid inactivation of coagulation factors (Figure 21.11). Antithrombin III is an\nα globulin that inhibits serine proteases of thrombin (factor IIa) and factor Xa. In the absence of heparin,\nantithrombin III interacts very slowly with thrombin and factor Xa. When heparin molecules bind to antithrombin\nIII, a conformational change occurs that catalyzes the inhibition of thrombin about 1000-fold. LMWHs complex\nwith antithrombin III and inactivate factor Xa (including that located on platelet surfaces) but do not bind as avidly\nto thrombin. A unique pentasaccharide sequence contained in heparin and LMWHs permits their binding to\nantithrombin III (Figure 21.12).\nFigure 21.11 Heparin accelerates inactivation of coagulation factors by antithrombin.\nFigure 21.12 Heparin-mediated and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)-mediated\ninactivation of thrombin or factor Xa.\n2.  Therapeutic use\nHeparin and the LMWHs limit the expansion of thrombi by preventing fibrin formation. These agents are used for\nthe treatment of acute venous thromboembolism (DVT or PE). Heparin and LMWHs are also used for prophylaxis\nof postoperative venous thrombosis in patients undergoing surgery (for example, hip replacement) and those with\nacute MI. These drugs are the anticoagulants of choice for treating pregnant women, because they do not cross the\nplacenta, due to their large size and negative charge. LMWHs do not require the same intense monitoring as\nheparin, thereby saving laboratory costs and nursing time. These advantages make LMWHs useful for both inpatient\nand outpatient therapy.\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\nHeparin must be administered subcutaneously or intravenously, because the drug does not readily cross membranes\n(Figure 21.13). The LMWHs are usually administered subcutaneously. [Note: Enoxaparin can be administered802\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 803 ---\n\nintravenously in the treatment of MI.] Heparin is often initiated as an intravenous bolus to achieve immediate\nanticoagulation. This is followed by lower doses or continuous infusion of heparin, titrated to the desired level of\nanticoagulation according to the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) or anti-Xa level. Whereas the\nanticoagulant effect with heparin occurs within minutes of IV administration (or 1 to 2 hours after subcutaneous\ninjection), the maximum anti–factor Xa activity of the LMWHs occurs about 4 hours after subcutaneous injection. It\nis usually not necessary to monitor coagulation values with LMWHs because the plasma levels and\npharmacokinetics of these drugs are more predictable. However, in renally impaired, pregnant, and obese patients,\nmonitoring of factor Xa levels is recommended with LMWHs. In the blood, heparin binds to many proteins that\nneutralize its activity, causing unpredictable pharmacokinetics. Heparin binding to plasma proteins is variable in\npatients with thromboembolic diseases. Although generally restricted to the circulation, heparin is taken up by the\nmonocyte/macrophage system, and it undergoes depolymerization and desulfation to inactive products. The inactive\nmetabolites, as well as some of the parent heparin undergo renal excretion. The LMWHs are primarily eliminated in\nthe urine. Therefore, renal insufficiency prolongs the half-life of LMWH, and the dose of LMWH should be reduced\nin patients with renal impairment. The half-life of heparin is approximately 1.5 hours, whereas the half-life of the\nLMWHs is longer than that of heparin, ranging from 3 to 12 hours.\nFigure 21.13 Administration and fate of heparin and low molecular weight heparins\n(LMWHs).\n4.  Adverse effects\nThe chief complication of heparin and LMWH therapy is bleeding (Figure 21.14). Careful monitoring of the patient\nand laboratory parameters is required to minimize bleeding. Excessive bleeding may be managed by discontinuing\nthe drug or by treating with protamine sulfate. When infused slowly, the latter combines ionically with heparin to\nform a stable, 1:1 inactive complex. It is important that the dosage of protamine sulfate is carefully titrated (1 mg for\nevery 100 units of heparin administered), because protamine sulfate is a weak anticoagulant, and excess amounts\nmay trigger bleeding episodes or worsen bleeding potential. Heparin preparations are obtained from porcine sources\nand, therefore, may be antigenic. Possible adverse reactions include chills, fever, urticaria, and anaphylactic shock.\nHeparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious condition, in which circulating blood contains an abnormally\nlow number of platelets. This reaction is immune mediated and carries a risk of venous and arterial embolism.\nHeparin therapy should be discontinued when patients develop HIT or show severe thrombocytopenia. In cases of\nHIT, heparin can be replaced by another anticoagulant, such as argatroban. [Note: LMWHs can have cross-\nsensitivity and are not recommended in patients with HIT.] In addition, osteoporosis has been observed in patients\non long-term heparin therapy. Heparin and LMWHs are contraindicated in patients who have hypersensitivity to\nheparin, bleeding disorders, alcoholism, or who have had recent surgery of the brain, eye, or spinal cord.\n803\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 804 ---\n\nFigure 21.14 Adverse effects of heparin.\n804\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 805 ---\n\nB.  Argatroban\nArgatroban [ar-GA-troh-ban] is a synthetic parenteral anticoagulant that is derived from L-arginine. It is a direct\nthrombin inhibitor. Argatroban is used for the prophylaxis or treatment of venous thromboembolism in patients with\nHIT, and it is also approved for use during PCI in patients who have or are at risk for developing HIT. Anticoagulant\neffects are immediate. Argatroban is metabolized in the liver and has a half-life of about 39 to 51 minutes. Dose\nreduction is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment. Monitoring includes aPTT, hemoglobin, and\nhematocrit. As with other anticoagulants, the major side effect is bleeding.\n805\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 806 ---\n\nC.  Bivalirudin and desirudin\nBivalirudin [bye-VAL-ih-ruh-din] and desirudin [deh-SIHR-uh-din] are parenteral anticoagulants that are analogs of\nhirudin, a thrombin inhibitor derived from saliva of the medicinal leech. These drugs are selective direct thrombin\ninhibitors that reversibly inhibit the catalytic site of both free and clot-bound thrombin. Bivalirudin is an alternative\nto heparin in patients undergoing PCI who have or are at risk for developing HIT and also in patients with unstable\nangina undergoing angioplasty. In patients with normal renal function, the half-life of bivalirudin is 25 minutes.\nDosage adjustments are required in patients with renal impairment. Desirudin is indicated for the prevention of DVT\nin patients undergoing hip replacement surgery. Like the others, bleeding is the major side effect of these agents.\n806\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 807 ---\n\nD.  Fondaparinux\nFondaparinux [fawn-da-PARE-eh-nux] is a synthetically derived pentasaccharide anticoagulant that selectively\ninhibits factor Xa. By selectively binding to antithrombin III, fondaparinux potentiates (300- to 1000-fold) the innate\nneutralization of factor Xa by antithrombin III. Fondaparinux is approved for use in the treatment of DVT and PE\nand for the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in the setting of orthopedic and abdominal surgery. The drug is\nwell absorbed from the subcutaneous route with a predictable pharmacokinetic profile and, therefore, requires less\nmonitoring than heparin. Fondaparinux is eliminated in the urine mainly as unchanged drug with an elimination\nhalf-life of 17 to 21 hours. It is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment. Bleeding is the major side\neffect of fondaparinux. There is no available agent for the reversal of bleeding associated with fondaparinux. HIT is\nless likely with fondaparinux than with heparin but is still a possibility.\n807\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 808 ---\n\nVII.  Vitamin K Antagonists\nCoumarin anticoagulants owe their action to the ability to antagonize the cofactor functions of vitamin K. The only\ncoumarin anticoagulant available in the United States is warfarin [WAR-far-in]. The international normalized ratio\n(INR) is the standard by which the anticoagulant activity of warfarin therapy is monitored. Warfarin has a narrow\ntherapeutic index. Therefore, it is important that the INR is maintained within the optimal range as much as possible,\nand frequent monitoring may be required.\n808\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 809 ---\n\nA.  Warfarin\n1.  Mechanism of action\nFactors II, VII, IX, and X (Figure 21.10) require vitamin K as a cofactor for their synthesis by the liver. These\nfactors undergo vitamin K–dependent posttranslational modification, whereby a number of their glutamic acid\nresidues are carboxylated to form γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues (Figure 21.15). The γ-carboxyglutamyl residues\nbind calcium ions, which are essential for interaction between the coagulation factors and platelet membranes. In the\ncarboxylation reactions, the vitamin K–dependent carboxylase fixes CO2 to form the new COOH group on glutamic\nacid. The reduced vitamin K cofactor is converted to vitamin K epoxide during the reaction. Vitamin K is\nregenerated from the epoxide by vitamin K epoxide reductase, the enzyme that is inhibited by warfarin. Warfarin\ntreatment results in the production of clotting factors with diminished activity (10% to 40% of normal), due to the\nlack of sufficient γ-carboxyglutamyl side chains. Unlike heparin, the anticoagulant effects of warfarin are not\nobserved immediately after drug administration. Instead, peak effects may be delayed for 72 to 96 hours, which is\nthe time required to deplete the pool of circulating clotting factors. The anticoagulant effects of warfarin can be\novercome by the administration of vitamin K . However, reversal following administration of vitamin K  takes\napproximately 24 hours (the time necessary for degradation of already synthesized clotting factors).\nFigure 21.15 Mechanism of action of warfarin. NADP+ = oxidized form of nicotinamide\nadenine dinucleotide phosphate; NADPH = reduced form of nicotinamide adenine\ndinucleotide phosphate.\n809\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 810 ---\n\n2.  Therapeutic use\nWarfarin is used in the prevention and treatment of DVT and PE, stroke prevention, stroke prevention in the setting\nof atrial fibrillation and/or prosthetic heart valves, protein C and S deficiency, and antiphospholipid syndrome. It is\nalso used for prevention of venous thromboembolism following orthopedic surgery.\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\nWarfarin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration (100% bioavailability with little individual patient variation).\nWarfarin is highly bound to plasma albumin, which prevents its diffusion into the cerebrospinal fluid, urine, and\nbreast milk. However, drugs that have a greater affinity for the albumin-binding site, such as sulfonamides, can\ndisplace the anticoagulant and lead to a transient, elevated activity. Drugs that affect warfarin binding to plasma\nproteins can lead to variability in the therapeutic response to warfarin. Warfarin readily crosses the placental barrier.\nThe mean half-life of warfarin is approximately 40 hours, but this value is highly variable among individuals.\nWarfarin is metabolized by the CYP450 system (mainly CYP2C9) to inactive components. After conjugation to\nglucuronic acid, the inactive metabolites are excreted in urine and feces. Agents that affect the metabolism of\nwarfarin may alter its therapeutic effects. Warfarin has numerous drug interactions that may potentiate or attenuate\nits anticoagulant effect. The list of interacting drugs is extensive. A summary of some of the important interactions\nis shown in Figure 21.16.\n810\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 811 ---\n\n811\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 812 ---\n\nFigure 21.16 Drugs affecting the anticoagulant effect of warfarin.\n4.  Adverse effects\nThe principal adverse effect of warfarin is bleeding. Minor bleeding may be treated by withdrawal of the drug or\nadministration of oral vitamin K , but severe bleeding may require greater doses of vitamin K  given intravenously.\nWhole blood, frozen plasma, and plasma concentrates of blood factors may also be used for rapid reversal of\nwarfarin. Skin lesions and necrosis are rare complications of warfarin therapy. Purple toe syndrome, a rare, painful,\nblue-tinged discoloration of the toe caused by cholesterol emboli from plaques, has also been observed with\nwarfarin therapy. Warfarin is teratogenic and is contraindicated in pregnancy.\n812\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 813 ---\n\nVIII.  Direct Oral Anticoagulants\n813\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 814 ---\n\nA.  Dabigatran\n1.  Mechanism of action\nDabigatran etexilate [da-bi-GAT-ran e-TEX-i-late] is the prodrug of the active moiety dabigatran, which is an oral\ndirect thrombin inhibitor. Both clot-bound thrombin and free thrombin are inhibited by dabigatran.\n2.  Therapeutic use\nDabigatran is approved for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial\nfibrillation. It may also be used in the treatment of DVT and PE in patients who have already received parenteral\nanticoagulants and as prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the risk of recurrence of DVT and PE. The drug is\ncontraindicated in patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves and is not recommended in patients with\nbioprosthetic heart valves.\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\nDabigatran etexilate is administered orally. It is hydrolyzed to the active drug, dabigatran, by various plasma\nesterases. Dabigatran is metabolized by esterases. It is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and is eliminated\nrenally.\n4.  Adverse effects\nThe major adverse effect, like other anticoagulants, is bleeding. Dabigatran should be used with caution in renal\nimpairment or in patients over the age of 75, as the risk of bleeding is higher in these groups. Idarucizumab may be\nused to reverse bleeding in severe cases. GI adverse effects are common with dabigatran and may include\ndyspepsia, abdominal pain, esophagitis, and GI bleeding. Abrupt discontinuation should be avoided, as patients may\nbe at increased risk for thrombotic events.\n814\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 815 ---\n\nB.  Direct oral factor Xa inhibitors\n1.  Mechanism of action\nApixaban [a-PIX-a-ban], betrixaban [be-TRIX-a-ban], edoxaban [e-DOX-a-ban], and rivaroxaban [RIV-a-ROX-a-\nban] are oral inhibitors of factor Xa. Inhibition of factor Xa reduces the production of thrombin (IIa) from\nprothrombin (Figure 21.10).\n2.  Therapeutic use\nWith the exception of betrixaban, these agents are approved for prevention of stroke in nonvalvular atrial\nfibrillation, as well as the treatment of DVT and PE. Rivaroxaban and apixaban are also used as prophylaxis to\nprevent or reduce the risk of recurrence of DVT and PE. Betrixaban is indicated for the prophylaxis of DVT and PE\nin at-risk hospitalized medical patients.\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\nThese drugs are adequately absorbed after oral administration. Rivaroxaban is metabolized by the CYP 3A4/5 and\nCYP 2J2 isoenzymes to inactive metabolites. About one-third of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine, and the\ninactive metabolites are excreted in the urine and feces. Apixaban is primarily metabolized by CYP 3A4, with CYP\nenzymes 1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2J2 all sharing minor metabolic roles; approximately 27% is excreted renally.\nEdoxaban and betrixaban are minimally metabolized and are eliminated primarily unchanged in the urine and feces,\nrespectively. All of these drugs are substrates of P-gp, and dosages should be reduced (in some cases concomitant\nuse should be avoided) with P-gp inhibitors such as clarithromycin, verapamil , and amiodarone. Concomitant\nadministration of apixaban and rivaroxaban with drugs that are strong P-gp and CYP 3A4 inducers (for example,\nphenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, St. John’s wort ) should be avoided due to the potential for reduced efficacy of\nthe factor Xa inhibitors.\n4.  Adverse effects\nBleeding is the most serious adverse effect. Currently there is no antidote, but recombinant factor Xa products are in\ndevelopment. Declining kidney function can prolong the effect of these drugs and, therefore, increase the risk of\nbleeding. Renal dosage adjustments are recommended for these agents. Abrupt discontinuation of the factor Xa\ninhibitors should be avoided.\n815\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 816 ---\n\nIX.  Thrombolytic Drugs\nAcute thromboembolic disease in selected patients may be treated by the administration of drugs that activate the\nconversion of plasminogen to plasmin, a serine protease that hydrolyzes fibrin and, thus, dissolves clots.\n816\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 817 ---\n\nA.  Common characteristics of thrombolytic agents\n1.  Mechanism of action\nThe thrombolytic agents act either directly or indirectly to convert plasminogen to plasmin, which, in turn, cleaves\nfibrin, thus lysing thrombi (Figure 21.17). Clot dissolution and reperfusion occur with a higher frequency when\ntherapy is initiated early after clot formation because clots become more resistant to lysis as they age. Unfortunately,\nincreased local thrombi may occur as the clot dissolves, leading to enhanced platelet aggregation and thrombosis.\nStrategies to prevent this include administration of antiplatelet drugs, such as aspirin, or antithrombotics such as\nheparin.\nFigure 21.17 Activation of plasminogen by thrombolytic drugs.\n2.  Therapeutic use\nOriginally used for the treatment of DVT and serious PE, thrombolytic drugs are currently used less frequently\nbecause of tendency to cause serious bleeding. For MI, intracoronary delivery of the drugs is the most reliable in\nterms of achieving recanalization. However, cardiac catheterization may not be possible in the 2- to 6-hour\n“therapeutic window,” beyond which significant myocardial salvage becomes less likely. Thus, thrombolytic agents\nare usually administered intravenously. Thrombolytic agents are helpful in restoring catheter and shunt function, by\nlysing clots causing occlusions. They are also used to dissolve clots that result in strokes.\n3.  Adverse effects\nThrombolytic agents do not distinguish between the fibrin of an unwanted thrombus and the fibrin of a beneficial\nhemostatic plug. Thus, hemorrhage is a major adverse effect. For example, a previously unsuspected lesion, such as\na gastric ulcer, may hemorrhage following injection of a thrombolytic agent (Figure 21.18). These drugs are\ncontraindicated in pregnancy and in patients with healing wounds, a history of cerebrovascular accident, brain\ntumor, head trauma, intracranial bleeding, and metastatic cancer.\n817\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 818 ---\n\nFigure 21.18 Degradation of an unwanted thrombus and a beneficial hemostatic plug by\nplasminogen activators.\n818\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 819 ---\n\nB.  Alteplase and tenecteplase\nAlteplase [AL-teh-place] (formerly known as tissue plasminogen activator or tPA) is a serine protease originally\nderived from cultured human melanoma cells. It is now obtained as a product of recombinant DNA technology.\nTenecteplase [ten-EK-te-place] is recombinant tPA with a longer half-life and greater binding affinity for fibrin than\nalteplase. Alteplase has a low affinity for free plasminogen in the plasma, but it rapidly activates plasminogen that is\nbound to fibrin in a thrombus or a hemostatic plug. Thus, alteplase is said to be “fibrin selective” at low doses.\nAlteplase is approved for the treatment of MI, massive PE, and acute ischemic stroke. Tenecteplase is approved only\nfor use in acute MI.\nAlteplase has a very short half-life (5 to 30 minutes), and therefore, a portion of the total dose is injected\nintravenously as a bolus, and the remaining drug is administered over 1 to 3 hours, depending on the indication.\nTenecteplase has a longer half-life and, therefore, may be administered as an intravenous bolus. Alteplase may cause\nangioedema, and there may be an increased risk of this effect when combined with angiotensin-converting enzyme\n(ACE) inhibitors.\n819\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 820 ---\n\nX.  Drugs Used to Treat Bleeding\nBleeding problems may have their origin in naturally occurring pathologic conditions, such as hemophilia, or as a\nresult of fibrinolytic states that may arise after surgery. The use of anticoagulants may also give rise to hemorrhage.\nCertain natural proteins and vitamin K , as well as synthetic antagonists, are effective in controlling this bleeding\n(Figure 21.19). Concentrated preparations of coagulation factors are available from human donors. However, these\npreparations carry the risk of transferring viral infections. Blood transfusion is also an option for treating severe\nhemorrhage.\nFigure 21.19 Summary of drugs used to treat bleeding. aPTT = activated partial\nthromboplastin time, CBC = complete blood count, CVA = cerebrovascular accident,\nINR = international normalized ratio, PT = prothrombin time.\n820\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 821 ---\n\nA.  Aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid\nFibrinolytic states can be controlled by the administration of aminocaproic [a-mee-noe-ka-PROE-ic] acid or\ntranexamic [tran-ex-AM-ic] acid. Both agents are synthetic, orally active, excreted in the urine, and inhibit\nplasminogen activation. Tranexamic acid is 10 times more potent than aminocaproic acid. A potential side effect is\nintravascular thrombosis.\n821\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 822 ---\n\nB.  Protamine sulfate\nProtamine [PROE-ta-meen] sulfate antagonizes the anticoagulant effects of heparin. This protein is derived from\nfish sperm or testes and is high in arginine content, which explains its basicity. The positively charged protamine\ninteracts with the negatively charged heparin, forming a stable complex without anticoagulant activity. Adverse\neffects of drug administration include hypersensitivity as well as dyspnea, flushing, bradycardia, and hypotension\nwhen rapidly injected.\n822\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 823 ---\n\nC.  Vitamin K\nVitamin K1 (phytonadione) administration can stop bleeding problems due to warfarin by increasing the supply of\nactive vitamin K1, thereby inhibiting the effect of warfarin. Vitamin K1 may be administered via the oral,\nsubcutaneous, or intravenous route. [Note: Intravenous vitamin K  should be administered by slow IV infusion to\nminimize the risk of hypersensitivity or anaphylactoid reactions.] For the treatment of bleeding, the subcutaneous\nroute of vitamin K1 is less preferred, as it is not as effective as oral or IV administration. The response to vitamin K1\nis slow, requiring about 24 hours to reduce INR (time to synthesize new coagulation factors). Thus, if immediate\nhemostasis is required, fresh frozen plasma should be infused.\n823\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 824 ---\n\nD.  Idarucizumab\nIdarucizumab [EYE-da-roo-KIZ-ue-mab] is a monoclonal antibody fragment used to reverse bleeding caused by\ndabigatran. By binding to dabigatran and its metabolites, idarucizumab neutralizes anticoagulation. Idarucizumab\nis administered intravenously and is rapidly eliminated. Idarucizumab is used in emergency situations, in the\ninpatient setting. Because it reverses the effect of dabigatran, thrombosis is the most serious adverse effect of\nidarucizumab.\n824\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 825 ---\n\n21.1\n21.2\n21.3\n21.4\n21.5\n21.6Study Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nWhich of the P2Y12 ADP receptor antagonists reversibly binds the receptor?\nA.  Clopidogrel\nB.  Prasugrel\nC.  Ticagrelor\nD.  Ticlopidine\nCorrect answer = C. Of the P2Y12 ADP receptor antagonists listed, ticagrelor is the only one that reversibly binds\nthe receptor. This is important when it comes to compliance. If a patient is not compliant, then the antiplatelet\nactivity of ticagrelor stops when the drug is missed (since the platelets are not irreversibly inhibited as they would\nbe with aspirin, clopidogrel, or prasugrel).\nA 70-year-old woman is diagnosed with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Her past medical history is significant\nfor chronic kidney disease, and her renal function is moderately diminished. Which anticoagulant for atrial\nfibrillation avoids the need for renal dose adjustment in this patient?\nA.  Apixaban\nB.  Dabigatran\nC.  Rivaroxaban\nD.  Warfarin\nCorrect answer = D. Warfarin does not require dosage adjustment in renal dysfunction. The INR is monitored and\ndosage adjustments are made on the basis of this information. All of the other agents are renally cleared to some\nextent and require dosage adjustments in renal dysfunction.\nAn 80-year-old man is taking warfarin indefinitely for the prevention of deep venous thrombosis. He is\ncompliant, has a stable INR, and denies bleeding or bruising. He is diagnosed with a urinary tract infection\nand is prescribed sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. What are the expected effects on his warfarin therapy?\nA.  Decreased anticoagulant effect of warfarin\nB.  Increased anticoagulant effect of warfarin\nC.  Activation of platelet activity\nD.  No change in anticoagulation status\nCorrect answer = B. Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim has a significant drug interaction with warfarin, such that it\ninhibits warfarin metabolism. Therefore, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim will cause increased anticoagulant\neffects, and the patient will need to have his warfarin dose decreased and INR checked frequently while he is on\nthis antibiotic.\nA 47-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with severe bleeding. Upon evaluation of the medical\nrecord, you discover that she takes dabigatran for a history of multiple DVTs. What is the appropriate\nreversal agent to administer to the patient at this time?\nA.  Protamine\nB.  Vitamin K\nC.  Idarucizumab\nD.  A reversal agent does not exist for this medication\nCorrect answer = C. Idarucizumab is used to reverse bleeding caused by dabigatran. By binding to dabigatran and\nits metabolites, idarucizumab neutralizes anticoagulation. It would be important to monitor this patient for any\nsigns of thrombosis due to reversal of her anticoagulation. Vitamin K is the antidote for warfarin, and protamine\nis the antidote for heparin.\nWhich must heparin bind to in order to exert its anticoagulant effect?\nA.  GP IIb/IIIa receptor\nB.  Thrombin\nC.  Antithrombin III\nD.  von Willebrand factor\nCorrect answer = C. Heparin binds to antithrombin III, causing a conformational change.

Enoxaparin\nD.  Clopidogrel\nCorrect answer = A. Betrixaban is only approved for the prophylaxis of DVT and PE; it is not approved for the\ntreatment of acute DVT. Enoxaparin is used for the treatment of DVT, but it is an injectable medication.\nClopidogrel is an antiplatelet medication that is not appropriate for acute treatment of DVT.\nWhich is most appropriate for reversing the anticoagulant effects of heparin?\nA.  Aminocaproic acid\nB.  Protamine sulfate\nC.  Vitamin K1\nD.  Tranexamic acid\nCorrect answer = B. Excessive bleeding may be managed by ceasing administration of heparin or by treating with\nprotamine sulfate. Infused slowly, protamine sulfate combines ionically with heparin to form a stable, inactive\ncomplex. Aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid are approved for the treatment of hemorrhage but do not\nspecifically reverse the effects of heparin to stop bleeding. Vitamin K1 is used to help reverse the effects of\nwarfarin-induced bleeding.\nA 62-year-old man taking warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation presents to his primary care\nphysician with an elevated INR of 10.5 without bleeding. He is instructed to hold his warfarin dose and\ngiven oral vitamin K1. When would the effects of vitamin K on the INR most likely be noted in this patient?\nA.  1 hour\nB.  6 hours\nC.  24 hours\nD.  72 hours\nCorrect answer = C. Vitamin K1 takes about 24 hours to see a reduction in the INR. This is due to the time\nrequired for the body to synthesize new coagulation factors.\nA 58-year-old man receives intravenous alteplase treatment for acute stroke. Five minutes following\ncompletion of alteplase infusion, he develops angioedema. Which of the following drugs may have increased\nthe risk of developing angioedema in this patient?\nA.  ACE inhibitor\nB.  GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist\nC.  Phosphodiesterase inhibitor\nD.  Thiazide diuretic\nCorrect answer = A. ACE inhibitors, aspirin, and prasugrel  all have possible adverse effects including\nangioedema. In the setting of alteplase administration, ACE inhibitors have been associated with an increased\nrisk of developing angioedema with concomitant use.826\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 827 ---\n\n22\nDrugs for Hyperlipidemia\nKaren Sando and Kevin Cowart\n827\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 828 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nCoronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. CHD is correlated with elevated levels of\nlow-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides, and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol\n(HDL-C). Other risk factors for CHD include cigarette smoking, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, chronic kidney\ndisease, and advanced age. Elevated cholesterol levels (hyperlipidemia) may be due to lifestyle factors (for example,\nlack of exercise or diet containing excess saturated fats). Hyperlipidemia can also result from an inherited defect in\nlipoprotein metabolism or, more commonly, from a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors. Appropriate\nlifestyle changes, along with drug therapy, can lead to a 30% to 40% reduction in CHD mortality.\nAntihyperlipidemic drugs (Figure 22.1) are often taken indefinitely to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic\ncardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in select patients and to control plasma lipid levels. [Note: ASCVD includes CHD,\nstroke, and peripheral arterial disease.] Figure 22.2 illustrates the normal metabolism of serum lipoproteins and the\ncharacteristics of the major genetic hyperlipidemias.\n828\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 829 ---\n\nFigure 22.1 Summary of antihyperlipidemic drugs.

Roman\nnumerals in the white circles refer to specific genetic types of hyperlipidemias\nsummarized on the facing page. apo CII = apolipoprotein CII found in chylomicrons and\nVLDL; CM = chylomicron; IDL = intermediate-density lipoprotein; LDL = low-density\nlipoprotein; PCSK9 = proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9; TG = triglyceride;\nVLDL = very–low-density lipoprotein. (Figure continues on next page)\n831\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 832 ---\n\nII.  Treatment Goals\nPlasma lipids consist mostly of lipoproteins, which are spherical complexes of lipids and specific proteins. The\nclinically important lipoproteins, listed in decreasing order of atherogenicity, are LDL, very–low-density lipoprotein\n(VLDL) and chylomicrons, and HDL. The occurrence of CHD is positively associated with high total cholesterol\nand has an even stronger correlation with elevated LDL-C. In contrast to LDL-C, high levels of HDL-C have been\nassociated with a decreased risk for CHD (Figure 22.3). According to cholesterol guidelines, the need for\nantihyperlipidemic drug therapy should be determined based on an assessment of risk for ASCVD, in conjunction\nwith evaluation of lipoprotein levels (for example, LDL-C; Figure 22.4). [Note: Therapeutic lifestyle changes, such\nas diet, exercise, and weight loss, may help reduce cholesterol levels; however, lifestyle modifications do not replace\nthe need for drug therapy in patients who fall into one of the four statin benefit groups (see Figure 22.4).]\nFigure 22.3 Effect of circulating low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density\nlipoprotein (HDL) on the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD).\n832\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 833 ---\n\nFigure 22.4 Treatment guidelines for hyperlipidemia. ASCVD = atherosclerotic\ncardiovascular disease; LDL-C = low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; TG = triglycerides.\n833\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 834 ---\n\nIII.  Drugs for Hyperlipidemia\nAntihyperlipidemic drugs include the statins, niacin, fibrates, bile acid sequestrants, a cholesterol absorption\ninhibitor, proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, and omega-3 fatty acids. These agents\nmay be used alone or in combination. However, drug therapy should always be accompanied by lifestyle\nmodifications, such as exercise and a diet low in saturated fats.\n834\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 835 ---\n\nA.  HMG CoA reductase inhibitors\n3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors (commonly known as statins) lower\nLDL-C, resulting in a substantial reduction in coronary events and death from CHD. Therapeutic benefits include\natherosclerotic plaque stabilization, improvement of coronary endothelial function, inhibition of platelet thrombus\nformation, and vascular anti-inflammatory activity. They are first-line treatment for patients with elevated risk of\nASCVD to reduce the occurrence of ASCVD events (see Figure 22.4). [Note: The intensity of statin therapy should\nbe guided by the patient’s absolute risk for an ASCVD event.]\n1.  Mechanism of action\nLovastatin [LOE-vah-stat-in], simvastatin [sim-vah-STAT-in], pravastatin [PRAH-vah-stat-in], atorvastatin [a-\nTOR-vah-stat-in], fluvastatin [FLOO-vah-stat-in], pitavastatin [pit-AV-a-STAT-in], and rosuvastatin [roe-SOO-va-\nstat-in] are competitive inhibitors of HMG CoA reductase, the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis. By\ninhibiting de novo cholesterol synthesis, they deplete the intracellular supply of cholesterol ( Figure 22.5). Depletion\nof intracellular cholesterol causes the cell to increase the number of cell surface LDL receptors that can bind and\ninternalize circulating LDL-C. Thus, plasma cholesterol is reduced, by both decreased cholesterol synthesis and\nincreased LDL-C catabolism. Rosuvastatin and atorvastatin are the most potent LDL-C lowering statins, followed\nby pitavastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and fluvastatin. [Note: Because these agents undergo a marked\nfirst-pass extraction by the liver, their dominant effect is on that organ.] The HMG CoA reductase inhibitors also\ndecrease triglyceride levels and may increase HDL-C in some patients.\nFigure 22.5 Inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA)\nreductase by the statin drugs. LDL = low-density lipoprotein; VLDL = very–low-density\nlipoprotein.\n2.  Therapeutic uses\nThese drugs are used to lower the risk of ASCVD events for patients in the four statin benefit groups. Statins are\neffective in lowering plasma cholesterol levels in all types of hyperlipidemias. However, patients who are\nhomozygous for familial hypercholesterolemia lack LDL receptors and, therefore, benefit much less from treatment\nwith these drugs.\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\nLovastatin and simvastatin are lactones that are hydrolyzed to the active drug. The remaining statins are all\nadministered in their active form. Absorption of the statins is variable (30% to 85%) following oral administration.\nAll statins are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isoenzymes in the liver, except pravastatin. Excretion\ntakes place principally through bile and feces, but some urinary elimination also occurs. Some characteristics of the\nstatins are summarized in Figure 22.6.\n835\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 836 ---\n\nFigure 22.6 Summary of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA)\nreductase inhibitors. LDL = low-density lipoprotein; HDL = high-density lipoprotein.\n4.  Adverse effects\nElevated liver enzymes may occur with statin therapy. Therefore, liver function should be evaluated prior to starting\ntherapy or if a patient has symptoms consistent with liver dysfunction. [Note: Hepatic insufficiency can cause drug\naccumulation.] Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis (disintegration of skeletal muscle; rare) have been reported ( Figure\n22.7). Risk factors for rhabdomyolysis, include renal insufficiency, vitamin D deficiency, hypothyroidism, advanced\nage, female sex, and use of drugs that increase the risk of muscle adverse effects, such as azole antifungals, protease\ninhibitors, cyclosporine, erythromycin, gemfibrozil , or niacin. Simvastatin is metabolized by CYP450 3A4, and\ninhibitors of this enzyme may increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis. Plasma creatine kinase levels should be\ndetermined in patients with muscle complaints. The HMG CoA reductase inhibitors may also increase the effect of\nwarfarin. Thus, it is important to evaluate the international normalized ratio (INR) when initiating a statin or\nchanging the dosage. These drugs are contraindicated during pregnancy, lactation, and active liver disease.\n836\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 837 ---\n\nFigure 22.7 Some adverse effects and precautions associated with 3-hydroxy-3-\nmethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors.\n837\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 838 ---\n\nB.  Niacin (nicotinic acid)\nNiacin [NYE-uh-sin] reduces LDL-C by 10% to 20% and is the most effective agent for increasing HDL-C. It also\nlowers triglycerides by 20% to 35% at typical doses of 1.5 to 3 g/day. Niacin can be used in combination with\nstatins, and fixed-dose combinations of long-acting niacin with lovastatin and simvastatin are available. [Note: the\naddition of niacin to statin therapy has not been shown to reduce the risk of ASCVD events.]\n1.  Mechanism of action\nAt gram doses, niacin strongly inhibits lipolysis in adipose tissue, thereby reducing production of free fatty acids\n(Figure 22.8). The liver normally uses circulating free fatty acids as a major precursor for triglyceride synthesis.\nReduced liver triglyceride levels decrease hepatic VLDL production, which in turn reduces LDL-C plasma\nconcentrations.\nFigure 22.8 Niacin inhibits lipolysis in adipose tissue, resulting in decreased hepatic\nvery–low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis and production of low-density\nlipoprotein (LDL) in the plasma.\n2.  Therapeutic uses\nBecause niacin lowers plasma levels of both cholesterol and triglycerides, it is useful in the treatment of familial\n838\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 839 ---\n\nhyperlipidemias. It is also used to treat other severe hypercholesterolemias, often in combination with other agents.\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\nNiacin is administered orally. It is converted in the body to nicotinamide, which is incorporated into the cofactor\nnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). Niacin, its nicotinamide derivative, and other metabolites are excreted\nin the urine. [Note: Administration of nicotinamide alone does not decrease plasma lipid levels.]\n4.  Adverse effects\nThe most common adverse effects of niacin are an intense cutaneous flush accompanied by an uncomfortable\nfeeling of warmth and pruritus. Administration of aspirin prior to taking niacin decreases the flush, which is\nprostaglandin-mediated. Some patients also experience nausea and abdominal pain. Slow titration of the dosage or\nuse of the sustained-release formulation of niacin reduces bothersome initial adverse effects. Niacin inhibits tubular\nsecretion of uric acid and, thus, predisposes patients to hyperuricemia and gout. Impaired glucose tolerance and\nhepatotoxicity have also been reported. The drug should be avoided in active hepatic disease or in patients with an\nactive peptic ulcer.\n839\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 840 ---\n\nC.  Fibrates\nFenofibrate [fen-oh-FIH-brate] and gemfibrozil  [jem-FI-broh-zill] are derivatives of fibric acid that lower serum\ntriglycerides and increase HDL-C.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nThe peroxisome proliferator–activated receptors (PPARs) are members of the nuclear receptor family that regulate\nlipid metabolism. PPARs function as ligand-activated transcription factors. Upon binding to their natural ligands\n(fatty acids or eicosanoids) or antihyperlipidemic drugs, PPARs are activated. They then bind to peroxisome\nproliferator response elements, which ultimately leads to decreased triglyceride concentrations through increased\nexpression of lipoprotein lipase (Figure 22.9) and decreased apolipoprotein (apo) CII concentration. Fenofibrate is\nmore effective than gemfibrozil  in lowering triglyceride levels. Fibrates also increase HDL-C by increasing the\nexpression of apo AI and apo AII.\n840\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 841 ---\n\nFigure 22.9 Activation of lipoprotein lipase by gemfibrozil. VLDL = very-low-density\nlipoprotein; IDL = intermediate-density lipoprotein.\n841\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 842 ---\n\n2.  Therapeutic uses\nThe fibrates are used in the treatment of hypertriglyceridemias. They are particularly useful in treating type III\nhyperlipidemia (dysbetalipoproteinemia), in which intermediate-density lipoprotein particles accumulate.\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\nGemfibrozil  and fenofibrate are completely absorbed after oral administration and distribute widely, bound to\nalbumin. Fenofibrate is a prodrug, which is converted to the active moiety fenofibric acid. Both drugs undergo\nextensive biotransformation and are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates.\n4.  Adverse effects\nThe most common adverse effects are mild gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances. These lessen as the therapy\nprogresses. Because these drugs increase biliary cholesterol excretion, there is a predisposition to form gallstones.\nMyositis (inflammation of a voluntary muscle) can occur, and muscle weakness or tenderness should be evaluated.\nPatients with renal insufficiency may be at risk. Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients taking\ngemfibrozil  and statins together. The use of gemfibrozil  is contraindicated with simvastatin, and, in general, the use\nof gemfibrozil  with any statin should be avoided. Both fibrates may increase the effects of warfarin. Therefore, INR\nshould be monitored more frequently when a fibrate is initiated. Fibrates should not be used in patients with severe\nhepatic or renal dysfunction, in patients with preexisting gallbladder disease or biliary cirrhosis.\n842\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 843 ---\n\nD.  Bile acid sequestrants\nBile acid sequestrants (resins) have significant LDL-C lowering effects, although the benefits are less than those\nobserved with statins.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nCholestyramine [koe-LES-tir-a-meen], colestipol  [koe-LES-tih-pole], and colesevelam [koh-le-SEV-e-lam] are\nanion-exchange resins that bind negatively charged bile acids and bile salts in the small intestine (Figure 22.10). The\nresin/bile acid complex is excreted in the feces, thus lowering the bile acid concentration. This causes hepatocytes to\nincrease conversion of cholesterol to bile acids, which are essential components of the bile. Consequently,\nintracellular cholesterol concentrations decrease, which activates an increased hepatic uptake of cholesterol-\ncontaining LDL-C particles, leading to a decrease in plasma LDL-C. [Note: This increased uptake is mediated by an\nup-regulation of cell surface LDL receptors.]\n843\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 844 ---\n\nFigure 22.10 Mechanism of bile acid sequestrants.\n844\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 845 ---\n\n2.  Therapeutic uses\nThe bile acid sequestrants are useful (often in combination with diet or niacin) for treating type IIA and type IIB\nhyperlipidemias. [Note: In those rare individuals who are homozygous for type IIA and functional LDL receptors\nare totally lacking, these drugs have little effect on plasma LDL levels.] Cholestyramine can also relieve pruritus\ncaused by accumulation of bile acids in patients with biliary stasis. Colesevelam is also indicated for type 2 diabetes\ndue to its glucose-lowering effects.\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\nBile acid sequestrants are insoluble in water and have large molecular weights. After oral administration, they are\nneither absorbed nor metabolically altered by the intestine. Instead, they are totally excreted in feces.\n4.  Adverse effects\nThe most common adverse effects are GI disturbances, such as constipation, nausea, and flatulence. Colesevelam\nhas fewer GI side effects than other bile acid sequestrants. These agents may impair the absorption of the fat-soluble\nvitamins (A, D, E, and K), and they interfere with the absorption of many drugs (for example, digoxin, warfarin, and\nthyroid hormone). Therefore, other drugs should be taken at least 1 to 2 hours before, or 4 to 6 hours after, the bile\nacid sequestrants. These agents may raise triglyceride levels and are contraindicated in patients with significant\nhypertriglyceridemia (greater than 400 mg/dL).\n845\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 846 ---\n\nE.  Cholesterol absorption inhibitor\nEzetimibe [eh-ZEH-teh-mibe] selectively inhibits absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol in the small intestine,\nleading to a decrease in the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver. This causes a reduction of hepatic\ncholesterol stores and an increase in clearance of cholesterol from the blood. Ezetimibe lowers LDL-C by\napproximately 18% to 23%. Due its modest LDL-C lowering, ezetimibe is often used as an adjunct to maximally\ntolerated statin therapy in patients with high ASCVD risk, or in statin-intolerant patients. Ezetimibe is primarily\nmetabolized in the small intestine and liver via glucuronide conjugation, with subsequent biliary and renal excretion.\nPatients with moderate to severe hepatic insufficiency should not be treated with ezetimibe. Adverse effects are\nuncommon with the use of ezetimibe.\n846\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 847 ---\n\nF.  Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 inhibitors\nProprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is an enzyme predominately produced in the liver. PCSK9\nbinds to the LDL receptor on the surface of hepatocytes, leading to the degradation of LDL receptors (Figure 22.11).\nBy inhibiting the PCSK9 enzyme, more LDL receptors are available to clear LDL-C from the serum. Alirocumab\n[al-i-ROK-ue-mab] and evolocumab [e-voe-LOK-ue-mab] are PCSK9 inhibitors, which are fully humanized\nmonoclonal antibodies. These agents are used in addition to maximally tolerated statin therapy in patients with\nheterozygous or homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or in patients with clinical ASCVD who require\nadditional LDL-C lowering. When combined with statin therapy, PCSK9 inhibitors provide potent LDL-C lowering\n(50% to 70%). They may also be considered for patients with high ASCVD risk and statin intolerance. PCSK9\ninhibitors are only available as subcutaneous injections and are administered every two to four weeks. Monoclonal\nantibodies are not eliminated by the kidneys and have been used in dialysis patients or those with severe renal\nimpairment. PCSK9 inhibitors are generally well tolerated. The most common adverse drug reactions are injection\nsite reactions, immunologic or allergic reactions, nasopharyngitis, and upper respiratory tract infections.\nFigure 22.11 Mechanism of action of PCSK9 inhibitors. PCSK9 binds to the LDL\nreceptor on the surface of hepatocytes, leading to degradation of LDL receptors.\nInhibition of PCSK9 prevents degradation of LDL receptors and promotes greater\nclearance of LDL-C from the serum. LDL = low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; PCSK9\n= proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9.\n847\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 848 ---\n\nG.  Omega-3 fatty acids\nOmega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are essential fatty acids that are predominately used for triglyceride\nlowering. Essential fatty acids inhibit VLDL and triglyceride synthesis in the liver. The omega-3 PUFAs\neicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are found in marine sources such as tuna, halibut,\nand salmon. Approximately 4 g of marine-derived omega-3 PUFAs daily decreases serum triglyceride\nconcentrations by 25% to 30%, with small increases in LDL-C and HDL-C. Over-the-counter or prescription fish oil\ncapsules (EPA/DHA) can be used for supplementation, as it is difficult to consume enough omega-3 PUFAs from\ndietary sources alone. Icosapent  [eye-KOE-sa-pent] ethyl  is a prescription product that contains only EPA and,\nunlike other fish oil supplements, does not significantly raise LDL-C. Omega-3 PUFAs can be considered as an\nadjunct to other lipid-lowering therapies for individuals with elevated triglycerides (≥500 mg/dL). Although\neffective for triglyceride lowering, omega-3 PUFA supplementation has not been shown to reduce cardiovascular\nmorbidity and mortality. The most common side effects of omega-3 PUFAs include GI effects (abdominal pain,\nnausea, diarrhea) and a fishy aftertaste. Bleeding risk can be increased in those who are concomitantly taking\nanticoagulants or antiplatelet agents.\n848\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 849 ---\n\nH.  Combination drug therapy\nIt is sometimes necessary to use two antihyperlipidemic drugs to achieve treatment goals. Patients with established\nASCVD, an elevated 10-year risk of ASCVD, or those that do not achieve intended LDL-C reductions on maximally\ntolerated statin therapy may be considered for combination therapy. Ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors can be\nconsidered for add-on therapy, since there is evidence that these combinations further reduce ASCVD events in\npatients already taking statin therapy. Combination drug therapy is not without risks. Liver and muscle toxicity\noccur more frequently with lipid-lowering drug combinations. Figure 22.12 summarizes some actions of the\nantihyperlipidemic drugs.\nFigure 22.12 Characteristics of antihyperlipidemic drug families. HDL = high-density\nlipoprotein; HMG CoA = 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A; LDL = low-density\nlipoprotein.\n849\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 850 ---\n\n22.1\n22.2\n22.3\n22.4\n22.5\n22.6Study Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nWhich of the following is the most common adverse effect of antihyperlipidemic drug therapy?\nA.  Elevated blood pressure\nB.  Gastrointestinal disturbance\nC.  Neurologic problems\nD.  Heart palpitations\nCorrect answer = B. Gastrointestinal disturbances frequently occur as an adverse effect of antihyperlipidemic\ndrug therapy. The other choices are not seen as often.\nWhich of the following hyperlipidemias is characterized by elevated plasma levels of chylomicrons and has\nno drug therapy available to lower the plasma lipoprotein levels?\nA.  Type I\nB.  Type II\nC.  Type III\nD.  Type IV\nCorrect answer = A. Type I hyperlipidemia (hyperchylomicronemia) is treated with a low-fat diet. No drug\ntherapy is effective for this disorder.\nWhich of the following drugs decreases cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-\nmethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase?\nA.  Fenofibrate\nB.  Cholestyramine\nC.  Lovastatin\nD.  Gemfibrozil\nCorrect answer = C. Lovastatin decreases cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting HMG CoA reductase. Fenofibrate\nand gemfibrozil increase the activity of lipoprotein lipase, thereby increasing the removal of VLDL from plasma.\nCholestyramine lowers the amount of bile acids returning to the liver via the enterohepatic circulation.\nWhich of the following nonstatin drugs lowers LDL-C most effectively?\nA.  Niacin\nB.  Alirocumab\nC.  Cholestyramine\nD.  Ezetimibe\nCorrect answer = B. Alirocumab is a PCSK9 inhibitor that can lower LDL-C by up to 70% in patients on statin\ntherapy. Niacin primarily raises HDL-C and decreases triglycerides, with less potent effects on LDL-C lowering.\nCholestyramine and ezetimibe both lower LDL-C, although not as potently as PCSK9 inhibitors.\nWhich of the following drugs binds bile acids in the intestine, thus preventing their return to the liver via the\nenterohepatic circulation?\nA.  Niacin\nB.  Fenofibrate\nC.  Cholestyramine\nD.  Fluvastatin\nCorrect answer = C. Cholestyramine is an anion-exchange resin that binds negatively charged bile acids and bile\nsalts in the small intestine. The resin/bile acid complex is excreted in the feces, thus preventing the bile acids\nfrom returning to the liver by the enterohepatic circulation. The other choices do not bind intestinal bile acids.\nA 65-year-old man has type 2 diabetes mellitus and an LDL-C of 165 mg/dL. Which is the best option to\nlower LDL-C and decrease the risk of ASCVD events in this patient?\nA.  Fenofibrate\nB.  Colesevelam\nC.  Rosuvastatin\nD.  Ezetimibe\nCorrect answer = C. Rosuvastatin, an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor (statin), is the most effective option for\nlowering LDL-C, achieving reductions of up to 60% from baseline levels. Statins are the primary modality for\nreducing ASCVD risk when drug therapy is indicated. Fenofibrate is more effective at lowering triglyceride\nlevels or raising HDL-C. Colesevelam can reduce LDL-C, but not as effectively as statins. Ezetimibe lowers\nLDL-C modestly compared to the LDL-C reduction achieved by statins.850\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 851 ---\n\n22.7\n22.8\n22.9\n22.10A 62-year-old female with hyperlipidemia and hypothyroidism is prescribed cholestyramine and\nlevothyroxine (thyroid hormone). What advice would you give this patient to avoid a drug interaction\nbetween her cholestyramine and levothyroxine?\nA.  Stop taking the levothyroxine as it can interact with cholestyramine.\nB.  Take levothyroxine 1 hour before cholestyramine on an empty stomach.\nC.  Switch cholestyramine to colesevelam as this eliminates the interaction.\nD.  Switch cholestyramine to colestipol as this eliminates the interaction.\nCorrect answer = B. Cholestyramine and the bile acid sequestrants can bind several medications, causing\ndecreased absorption of medications such as levothyroxine. Administration of levothyroxine 1 hour before or 4 to\n6 hours after cholestyramine can help to avoid this interaction. Choices C and D are incorrect, as all bile acid\nsequestrants cause this interaction. Choice A is incorrect, as this patient should not stop her thyroid medication.\nA 42-year-old man was started on sustained-release niacin 2 weeks ago. He reports uncomfortable flushing\nand itchiness that he thinks is related to the niacin. Which of the following can help manage this adverse\neffect of niacin therapy?\nA.  Administer aspirin 30 minutes prior to taking niacin.\nB.  Administer aspirin 30 minutes after taking niacin.\nC.  Increase the dose of niacin.\nD.  Change the sustained-release niacin to immediate-release niacin.\nCorrect answer = A. Flushing associated with niacin is prostaglandin mediated; therefore, use of aspirin (a\nprostaglandin inhibitor) can help to minimize this adverse effect. It must be administered 30 minutes before the\ndose of the niacin; therefore, choice B is incorrect. Increasing the dose of niacin is likely to increase these\ncomplaints; therefore, choice C is incorrect. The sustained-release formulation of niacin has less incidence of\nflushing versus that of the immediate release; therefore, choice D is incorrect.\nA 72-year-old man with hyperlipidemia and renal insufficiency has been treated with high-intensity\natorvastatin for 6 months. His LDL-C is 131 mg/dL; triglycerides, 710 mg/dL; and HDL-C, 32 mg/dL. His\nphysician wishes to add another agent for hyperlipidemia. Which is the best option to address the\nhyperlipidemia in this patient?\nA.  Fenofibrate\nB.  Niacin\nC.  Colestipol\nD.  Gemfibrozil\nCorrect answer = B. This patient has significantly elevated triglycerides and low HDL-C. Niacin can lower\ntriglycerides by 35% to 50% and also raise HDL-C. The fibrates (fenofibrate and gemfibrozil) should not be used\ndue to the history of renal insufficiency. In addition, the use of gemfibrozil with statins should be avoided.\nColestipol should not be used because triglycerides are greater than 400 mg/dL.\nWhich patient population is most likely to experience myalgia (muscle pain) or myopathy with use of HMG\nCoA reductase inhibitors?\nA.  Patients with renal insufficiency\nB.  Patients with gout\nC.  Patients with hypertriglyceridemia\nD.  Patients taking warfarin (blood thinner)\nCorrect answer = A. Patients with a history of renal insufficiency have a higher incidence of developing myalgias,\nmyopathy, and rhabdomyolysis with use of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), especially with those that are\nrenally eliminated as drug accumulation can occur. The other populations have not been reported to have a higher\nincidence of this adverse effect with HMG CoA reductase inhibitors.851\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 852 ---\n\nUNIT V\nDrugs Affecting the Endocrine System\n852\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 853 ---\n\n23\nPituitary and Thyroid\nShannon Miller and Karen Whalen\n853\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 854 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nThe endocrine system releases hormones into the bloodstream, which carries chemical messengers to target cells\nthroughout the body. Hormones have a much broader range of response time than do nerve impulses, requiring from\nseconds to days, or longer, to cause a response that may last for weeks or months. [Note: Nerve impulses generally\nact within milliseconds.] An important function of the hypothalamus is to connect the nervous system with the\nendocrine system via the pituitary gland. This chapter presents the central role of hypothalamic and pituitary\nhormones in regulating body functions. In addition, drugs affecting thyroid hormone synthesis and/or secretion are\ndiscussed (Figure 23.1). Chapters 24 to 26 focus on drugs that affect the synthesis and/or secretion of specific\nhormones and their actions.\n854\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 855 ---\n\nFigure 23.1 Hormones and drugs affecting the hypothalamus, pituitary, and thyroid.\n855\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 856 ---\n\nII.  Hypothalamic and Anterior Pituitary Hormones\nThe hormones secreted by the hypothalamus and the pituitary are peptides or glycoproteins that act by binding to\nspecific receptor sites on target tissues. The hormones of the anterior pituitary are regulated by neuropeptides that\nare called either “releasing” or “inhibiting” factors or hormones. These are produced in the hypothalamus, and they\nreach the pituitary by the hypophyseal portal system (Figure 23.2). The interaction of the releasing hormones with\nreceptors results in the activation of genes that promote the synthesis of protein precursors. The protein precursors\nthen undergo posttranslational modification to produce hormones, which are released into the circulation. Each\nhypothalamic regulatory hormone controls the release of a specific hormone from the anterior pituitary. Pituitary\nhormone preparations are currently used for specific hormonal deficiencies, although most of the agents have\nlimited therapeutic applications. Hormones of the anterior pituitary are administered intramuscularly (IM),\nsubcutaneously, or intranasally because their peptidyl nature makes them susceptible to destruction by proteolytic\nenzymes of the digestive tract.\nFigure 23.2 Anterior pituitary hormones. ACTH = adrenocorticotropic hormone; TSH =\nthyroid-stimulating hormone; FSH = follicle-stimulating hormone; LH = luteinizing\nhormone.\n856\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 857 ---\n\nA.  Adrenocorticotropic hormone (corticotropin)\nCorticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is responsible for the synthesis and release of the peptide\nproopiomelanocortin by the pituitary (Figure 23.3). Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or corticotropin [kor-ti-\nkoe-TROE-pin] is a product of the posttranslational processing of this precursor polypeptide. [Note: CRH is used\ndiagnostically to differentiate between Cushing syndrome and ectopic ACTH-producing cells.] Normally, ACTH is\nreleased from the pituitary in pulses with an overriding diurnal rhythm, with the highest concentration occurring in\nearly morning and the lowest in late evening. Stress stimulates its secretion, whereas cortisol acting via negative\nfeedback suppresses its release.\n857\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 858 ---\n\n858\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 859 ---\n\nFigure 23.3 Secretion and actions of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). CRH =\ncorticotropin-releasing hormone.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nACTH binds to receptors on the surface of the adrenal cortex, thereby activating G protein–coupled processes that\nultimately stimulate the rate-limiting step in the adrenocorticosteroid synthetic pathway (cholesterol to\npregnenolone; Figure 23.3). This pathway ends with the synthesis and release of adrenocorticosteroids and the\nadrenal androgens.\n2.  Therapeutic uses\nThe availability of synthetic adrenocorticosteroids with specific properties has limited the use of corticotropin\nmainly to serving as a diagnostic tool for differentiating between primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease,\nassociated with adrenal atrophy) and secondary adrenal insufficiency (caused by inadequate secretion of ACTH by\nthe pituitary). Therapeutic corticotropin preparations are extracts from the anterior pituitaries of domestic animals or\nsynthetic human ACTH. The latter, cosyntropin [ko-sin-TROE-pin], is preferred for the diagnosis of adrenal\ninsufficiency. ACTH is also used in the treatment of infantile spasms and multiple sclerosis.\n3.  Adverse effects\nShort-term use of ACTH for diagnostic purposes is usually well tolerated. With longer use, toxicities are similar to\nglucocorticoids and include hypertension, peripheral edema, hypokalemia, emotional disturbances, and increased\nrisk of infection.\n859\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 860 ---\n\nB.  Growth hormone (somatotropin)\nSomatotropin is released by the anterior pituitary in response to growth hormone (GH)-releasing hormone (Figure\n23.4). Conversely, secretion of GH is inhibited by the hormone somatostatin (see below). GH is released in a\npulsatile manner, with the highest levels occurring during sleep. With increasing age, GH secretion decreases,\naccompanied by a decrease in lean muscle mass. Somatotropin influences a wide variety of biochemical processes\n(for example, cell proliferation and bone growth). Synthetic human GH (somatropin [soe-mah-TROE-pin]) is\nproduced using recombinant DNA technology.\nFigure 23.4 Secretion of growth hormone (GH). GHRH = growth hormone–releasing\nhormone.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nAlthough many physiologic effects of GH are exerted directly at its targets, others are mediated through the\nsomatomedins—insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2 (IGF-1 and IGF-2). [Note: In acromegaly (a syndrome of excess\nGH due to hormone-secreting tumors), IGF-1 levels are consistently high, reflecting elevated GH.]\n2.  Therapeutic uses\nSomatropin is used in the treatment of GH deficiency, growth failure in children, treatment of HIV patients with\ncachexia, and GH replacement in adults with confirmed deficiency. [Note: GH administered to adults increases lean\nbody mass, bone density, and skin thickness, and decreases adipose tissue. Many consider GH an “antiaging”\nhormone. This has led to off-label use of GH by older individuals and by athletes seeking to enhance performance.]\nSomatropin is administered by subcutaneous or IM injection. Although the half-life of GH is short (approximately\n25 minutes), it induces release of IGF-1 from the liver, which is responsible for subsequent GH-like actions.\n3.  Adverse effects\nAdverse effects of somatropin include pain at the injection site, edema, arthralgias, myalgias, nausea, and an\nincreased risk of diabetes. Somatropin should not be used in pediatric patients with closed epiphyses, patients with860\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 861 ---\n\ndiabetic retinopathy, or obese patients with Prader-Willi syndrome.\n861\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 862 ---\n\nC.  Somatostatin (growth hormone–inhibiting hormone)\nIn the pituitary, somatostatin binds to receptors that suppress GH and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) release.\nOriginally isolated from the hypothalamus, somatostatin is a small polypeptide found in neurons throughout the\nbody as well as in the intestine, stomach, and pancreas. Somatostatin not only inhibits release of GH but also insulin,\nglucagon, and gastrin. Octreotide [ok-TREE-oh-tide] and lanreotide [lan-REE-oh-tide] are synthetic analogs of\nsomatostatin with longer half-lives. Depot formulations of these agents allow for administration every 4 weeks.\nThey have found use in the treatment of acromegaly and in severe diarrhea/flushing episodes associated with\ncarcinoid tumors. An intravenous infusion of octreotide is also used for the treatment of bleeding esophageal\nvarices. Adverse effects of octreotide include bradycardia, diarrhea, abdominal pain, flatulence, nausea, and\nsteatorrhea. Gallbladder emptying is delayed, and asymptomatic cholesterol gallstones can occur with long-term\ntreatment.\n862\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 863 ---\n\nD.  Gonadotropin-releasing hormone\nPulsatile secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus is essential for release of the\ngonadotropins follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary.\nHowever, continuous administration of GnRH inhibits gonadotropin release through down-regulation of GnRH\nreceptors on the pituitary. Continuous administration of synthetic GnRH analogs, such as leuprolide [loo-PROE-\nlide], is effective in suppressing production of FSH and LH (Figure 23.5). Suppression of gonadotropins, in turn,\nleads to reduced production of gonadal steroid hormones (androgens and estrogens). Thus, these agents are effective\nin the treatment of prostate cancer, endometriosis, and precocious puberty. Leuprolide is also used to suppress the\nLH surge and prevent premature ovulation in women undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation protocols for the\ntreatment of infertility. [Note: GnRH antagonists such as cetrorelix (set-roe-REL-iks) and ganirelix (ga-ni-REL-iks)\ncan also be used to inhibit LH secretion in infertility protocols.] In women, the GnRH analogs may cause hot flushes\nand sweating, as well as diminished libido, depression, and ovarian cysts. They are contraindicated in pregnancy and\nbreast-feeding. In men, they initially cause a rise in testosterone that can result in bone pain. Hot flushes, edema,\ngynecomastia, and diminished libido may also occur.\nFigure 23.5 Secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone\n(LH). GnRH = gonadotropin-releasing hormone.\n863\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 864 ---\n\nE.  Gonadotropins\nThe gonadotropins (FSH and LH) are produced in the anterior pituitary. The regulation of gonadal steroid hormones\ndepends on these agents. They find use in the treatment of infertility. Menotropins [men-oh-TROE-pinz] (also\nknown as human menopausal gonadotropins or hMG) are obtained from urine of postmenopausal women and\ncontain both FSH and LH. Urofollitropin [yoor-oh-fol-li-TROE-pin] is FSH obtained from postmenopausal women\nand is devoid of LH. Follitropin [fol-ih-TROE-pin] alfa and follitropin beta are human FSH products manufactured\nusing recombinant DNA technology. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a placental hormone that is excreted\nin urine of pregnant women. The effects of hCG and choriogonadotropin [kore-ee-oh-goe-NAD-oh-troe-pin] alfa\n(made using recombinant DNA technology) are essentially identical to those of LH. All of these hormones are\ninjected via the IM or subcutaneous route. Injection of hMG or FSH products over a period of 5 to 12 days causes\novarian follicular growth and maturation, and with subsequent injection of hCG, ovulation occurs. Adverse effects\ninclude ovarian enlargement and possible ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, which may be life threatening.\nMultiple births can occur.\n864\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 865 ---\n\nF.  Prolactin\nProlactin is a peptide hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary. Its primary function is to stimulate and maintain\nlactation. In addition, it decreases sexual drive and reproductive function. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulates\nthe release of prolactin, and secretion is inhibited by dopamine acting at D2 receptors (Figure 23.6). [Note: Drugs\nthat act as dopamine antagonists (for example, metoclopramide and some antipsychotics) can increase the secretion\nof prolactin.] Hyperprolactinemia, which is associated with galactorrhea and hypogonadism, is treated with D2\nreceptor agonists, such as bromocriptine and cabergoline. Both of these agents also find use in the treatment of\npituitary microadenomas. Bromocriptine is also indicated for treatment of type 2 diabetes. Among their adverse\neffects are nausea, headache and, less frequently, psychosis.\nFigure 23.6 Secretion and action of prolactin. DA = dopamine; TRH = thyrotropin-\nreleasing hormone.\n865\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 866 ---\n\nIII.  Hormones of the Posterior Pituitary\nIn contrast to the hormones of the anterior lobe of the pituitary, those of the posterior lobe, vasopressin and oxytocin,\nare not regulated by releasing hormones. Instead, they are synthesized in the hypothalamus, transported to the\nposterior pituitary, and released in response to specific physiologic signals, such as high plasma osmolarity or\nparturition. Both hormones are administered intravenously and have very short half-lives. Their actions are\nsummarized in Figure 23.7.\n866\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 867 ---\n\n867\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 868 ---\n\nFigure 23.7 Actions of oxytocin and vasopressin.\n868\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 869 ---\n\nA.  Oxytocin\nOxytocin [ok-se-TOE-sin] is used in obstetrics to stimulate uterine contraction and induce labor. Oxytocin also\ncauses milk ejection by contracting the myoepithelial cells around the mammary alveoli. Although toxicities are\nuncommon with proper drug use, hypertension, uterine rupture, water retention, and fetal death may occur. Its\nantidiuretic and pressor activities are much less than those of vasopressin.\n869\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 870 ---\n\nB.  Vasopressin\nVasopressin [vas-oh-PRESS-in] (antidiuretic hormone) is structurally related to oxytocin. Vasopressin has both\nantidiuretic and vasopressor effects (Figure 23.7). In the kidney, it binds to the V2 receptor to increase water\npermeability and reabsorption in the collecting tubules. Thus, the major use of vasopressin is to treat diabetes\ninsipidus. It also finds use in septic shock and in controlling bleeding due to esophageal varices. Other effects of\nvasopressin are mediated by the V1 receptor, which is found in the liver, vascular smooth muscle (where it causes\nconstriction), and other tissues. The major toxicities of vasopressin are water intoxication and hyponatremia.\nAbdominal pain, tremor, and vertigo can also occur. Desmopressin [des-moe-PRESS-in], an analog of vasopressin,\nhas minimal activity at the V1 receptor, making it largely free of pressor effects. This analog is longer acting than\nvasopressin and is preferred for the treatment of diabetes insipidus and nocturnal enuresis. For these indications,\ndesmopressin is administered intranasally or orally. [Note: The nasal spray should not be used for enuresis due to\nreports of seizures in children using this formulation.] Local irritation may occur with the nasal spray.\n870\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 871 ---\n\nIV.  Thyroid Hormones\nThe thyroid gland facilitates normal growth and maturation by maintaining a level of metabolism in the tissues that\nis optimal for normal function. The two major thyroid hormones are triiodothyronine (T3; the most active form) and\nthyroxine (T4). Inadequate secretion of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) results in bradycardia, cold intolerance,\nand mental and physical slowing. In children, this can cause mental retardation and dwarfism. By contrast, excess\nsecretion of thyroid hormones (hyperthyroidism) can cause tachycardia and cardiac arrhythmias, body wasting,\nnervousness, tremor, and heat intolerance.\n871\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 872 ---\n\nA.  Thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion\nThe thyroid gland is made up of multiple follicles that consist of a single layer of epithelial cells surrounding a\nlumen filled with thyroglobulin (the storage form of thyroid hormone). Thyroid function is controlled by TSH\n(thyrotropin), which is synthesized by the anterior pituitary (Figure 23.8). [Note: The hypothalamic thyrotropin-\nreleasing hormone (TRH) governs the generation of TSH.] TSH action is mediated by cAMP and leads to\nstimulation of iodide (I−) uptake by the thyroid gland. Oxidation to iodine (I2) by a peroxidase is followed by\niodination of tyrosines on thyroglobulin. [Note: Antibodies to thyroid peroxidase are diagnostic for Hashimoto\nthyroiditis, a common cause of hypothyroidism.] Condensation of two diiodotyrosine residues gives rise to T4,\nwhereas condensation of a monoiodotyrosine residue with a diiodotyrosine residue generates T3. The hormones are\nreleased following proteolytic cleavage of the thyroglobulin. A summary of the steps in thyroid hormone synthesis\nand secretion is shown in Figure 23.9.\nFigure 23.8 Feedback regulation of thyroid hormone release. SS = somatostatin; T3 =\ntriiodothyronine; T4 = thyroxine; TRH = thyrotropin-releasing hormone; TSH = thyroid-\nstimulating hormone.\n872\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 873 ---\n\nFigure 23.9 Biosynthesis of thyroid hormones.\n873\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 874 ---\n\nB.  Mechanism of action\nMost circulating T3 and T4 is bound to thyroxine-binding globulin in the plasma. The hormones must dissociate\nfrom thyroxine-binding globulin prior to entry into cells. In the cell, T4 is enzymatically deiodinated to T3, which\nenters the nucleus and attaches to specific receptors. The activation of these receptors promotes the formation of\nRNA and subsequent protein synthesis, which is responsible for the effects of T4.\n874\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 875 ---\n\nC.  Pharmacokinetics\nBoth T4 and T3 are absorbed after oral administration. Food, calcium preparations, iron salts, and aluminum-\ncontaining antacids can decrease the absorption of T4. Deiodination is the major route of metabolism of T4. T3 also\nundergoes sequential deiodination. The hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and\nsulfates and excreted into bile.\n875\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 876 ---\n\nD.  Treatment of hypothyroidism\nHypothyroidism usually results from autoimmune destruction of the gland and is diagnosed by elevated TSH.\nLevothyroxine (T4) [leh-vo-thye-ROK-sin] is preferred over T3 (liothyronine [lye-oh-THYE-roe-neen]) or T3/T4\ncombination products (liotrix [LYE-oh-trix]) for the treatment of hypothyroidism. Levothyroxine is better tolerated\nthan T3 preparations and has a longer half-life. It is dosed once daily, and steady state is achieved in 6 to 8 weeks.\nToxicity is directly related to T4 levels and manifests as nervousness, palpitations and tachycardia, heat intolerance,\nand unexplained weight loss. Drugs that induce the cytochrome P-450 enzymes, such as phenytoin, rifampin, and\nphenobarbital , accelerate metabolism of thyroid hormones and may decrease the effectiveness (Figure 23.10).\nFigure 23.10 Enzyme induction can increase the metabolism of the thyroid hormones. T3\n= triiodothyronine; T4 = thyroxine.\n876\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 877 ---\n\nE.  Treatment of hyperthyroidism (thyrotoxicosis)\nGraves disease, an autoimmune disease that affects the thyroid, is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. In\nthese situations, TSH levels are low due to negative feedback. [Note: Feedback inhibition of TRH occurs with high\nlevels of circulating thyroid hormone, which, in turn, decreases secretion of TSH.] The goal of therapy is to decrease\nsynthesis and/or release of additional hormone. This can be accomplished by removing part or all of the thyroid\ngland, by inhibiting synthesis of the hormones, or by blocking release of hormones from the follicle.\n1.  Removal of the thyroid\nThis can be accomplished surgically or by destruction of the gland with radioactive iodine (131I), which is\nselectively taken up by the thyroid follicular cells. Most patients become hypothyroid after radioactive iodine and\nrequire treatment with levothyroxine.\n2.  Inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis\nThe thioamides, propylthiouracil  [proe-pil-thye-oh-YOOR-ah-sil] (PTU) and methimazole [me-THIM-ah-zole], are\nconcentrated in the thyroid, where they inhibit both the oxidative processes required for iodination of tyrosyl groups\nand the condensation (coupling) of iodotyrosines to form T3 and T4 (Figure 23.9). PTU also blocks the peripheral\nconversion of T4 to T3. [Note: These drugs have no effect on thyroglobulin already stored in the gland. Therefore,\nclinical effects may be delayed until thyroglobulin stores are depleted (Figure 23.11).] Methimazole is preferred over\nPTU because it has a longer half-life, allowing for once-daily dosing, and a lower incidence of adverse effects.\nHowever, PTU is recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy due to a greater risk of teratogenic effects\nwith methimazole. PTU has been associated with hepatotoxicity and, rarely, agranulocytosis.\nFigure 23.11 Time required for patients with Graves hyperthyroidism to become\neuthyroid with normal serum T4 and T3 concentrations.\n3.  Blockade of hormone release\nA pharmacologic dose of iodide inhibits the iodination of tyrosines (“Wolff-Chaikoff effect”), but this effect lasts\nonly a few days. More importantly, iodide inhibits the release of thyroid hormones from thyroglobulin by\nmechanisms not yet understood. Iodide is employed to treat thyroid storm or prior to surgery, because it decreases\nthe vascularity of the thyroid gland. Iodide, administered orally, is not useful for long-term therapy; the thyroid\nceases to respond to the drug after a few weeks. Adverse effects include sore mouth and throat, swelling of the\ntongue or larynx, rashes, ulcerations of mucous membranes, and metallic taste.\n4.  Thyroid storm\nThyroid storm presents with extreme symptoms of hyperthyroidism. The treatment of thyroid storm is the same as\nfor hyperthyroidism, except that the drugs are given in higher doses and more frequently. β-Blockers, such as\nmetoprolol  or propranolol , are effective in blunting the widespread sympathetic stimulation that occurs in\nhyperthyroidism.\n877\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 878 ---\n\n878\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 879 ---\n\n23.1\n23.2\n23.3\n23.4\n23.5\n23.6Study Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nWhich option is most appropriate for a patient with newly diagnosed hyperthyroidism in the first trimester of\npregnancy?\nA.  Methimazole\nB.  Propylthiouracil (PTU)\nC.  Radioactive iodine\nD.  Surgical removal of the thyroid\nCorrect answer = B. Methimazole is generally preferred over PTU because it has a longer half-life and lower\nincidence of adverse effects. However, PTU is recommended in the first trimester of pregnancy due to a greater\nrisk of teratogenic effects with methimazole. Surgery is not ideal in a pregnant patient.

Overview\nThe pancreas produces the peptide hormones insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin. The peptide hormones are\nsecreted from cells in the islets of Langerhans (β-cells produce insulin, α cells produce glucagon, and δ cells produce\nsomatostatin). These hormones play an important role in regulating metabolic activities of the body, particularly\nglucose homeostasis. A relative or absolute lack of insulin, as seen in diabetes mellitus, can cause serious\nhyperglycemia. Left untreated, retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and cardiovascular complications may result.\nAdministration of insulin preparations or other glucose-lowering agents (Figure 24.1) can reduce morbidity and\nmortality associated with diabetes.\n882\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 883 ---\n\n883\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 884 ---\n\nFigure 24.1 Summary of drugs used in the treatment of diabetes. GLP-1 = glucagon-like\npeptide-1.\n884\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 885 ---\n\nII.  Diabetes Mellitus\nThe incidence of diabetes is growing rapidly in the United States and worldwide. An estimated 30.3 million people\nin the United States and 422 million people worldwide are afflicted with diabetes. Diabetes is not a single disease.\nRather, it is a heterogeneous group of syndromes characterized by elevated blood glucose attributed to a relative or\nabsolute deficiency of insulin. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recognizes four clinical classifications of\ndiabetes: type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes, and diabetes due to other causes such as genetic\ndefects or medications. Figure 24.2 summarizes the characteristics of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Gestational\ndiabetes is defined as carbohydrate intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy.\nFigure 24.2 Comparison of type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\n885\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 886 ---\n\nA.  Type 1 diabetes\nType 1 diabetes most commonly afflicts children, adolescents, or young adults, but some latent forms occur later in\nlife. The disease is characterized by an absolute deficiency of insulin due to destruction of β cells. Without\nfunctional β cells, the pancreas fails to respond to glucose, and a person with type 1 diabetes shows classic\nsymptoms of insulin deficiency (polydipsia, polyphagia, polyuria, and weight loss).\n1.  Cause\nLoss of β-cell function in type 1 diabetes results from autoimmune-mediated processes that may be triggered by\nviruses or other environmental toxins. In patients without diabetes, constant β-cell secretion maintains low basal\nlevels of circulating insulin. This suppresses lipolysis, proteolysis, and glycogenolysis. A burst of insulin secretion\noccurs within 2 minutes after ingesting a meal, in response to transient increases in circulating glucose and amino\nacids. This lasts for up to 15 minutes, followed by the postprandial secretion of insulin. However, without functional\nβ cells, those with type 1 diabetes can neither maintain basal secretion of insulin nor respond to variations in\ncirculating glucose (Figure 24.3).\nFigure 24.3 Release of insulin that occurs in response to an IV glucose load in normal\nsubjects and diabetic patients.\n2.  Treatment\nA person with type 1 diabetes must rely on exogenous insulin to control hyperglycemia, avoid ketoacidosis, and\nmaintain acceptable levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). [Note: HbA1c is a marker of overall glucose control\nand is used to monitor diabetes in clinical practice. The rate of formation of HbA1c is proportional to the average\nblood glucose concentration over the previous 3 months. A higher average glucose results in a higher HbA1c.] The\ngoal of insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes is to maintain blood glucose as close to normal as possible and to avoid\nwide fluctuations in glucose. The use of home blood glucose monitors facilitates frequent self-monitoring and\ntreatment with insulin.\n886\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 887 ---\n\n887\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 888 ---\n\nB.  Type 2 diabetes\nType 2 diabetes accounts for greater than 90% of cases. Type 2 diabetes is influenced by genetic factors, aging,\nobesity, and peripheral insulin resistance, rather than autoimmune processes. The metabolic alterations are generally\nmilder than those observed with type 1 diabetes (for example, patients with type 2 diabetes typically are not ketotic),\nbut the long-term clinical consequences are similar.\n1.  Cause\nType 2 diabetes is characterized by a lack of sensitivity of target organs to insulin ( Figure 24.4). In type 2 diabetes,\nthe pancreas retains some β-cell function, but insulin secretion is insufficient to maintain glucose homeostasis\n(Figure 24.3) in the face of increasing peripheral insulin resistance. The β-cell mass may gradually decline over time\nin type 2 diabetes. In contrast to patients with type 1 diabetes, those with type 2 diabetes are often obese. Obesity\ncontributes to insulin resistance, which is considered the major underlying defect of type 2 diabetes.\nFigure 24.4 Major factors contributing to hyperglycemia observed in type 2 diabetes.\n888\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 889 ---\n\n2.  Treatment\nThe goal in treating type 2 diabetes is to maintain blood glucose within normal limits and to prevent the\ndevelopment of long-term complications. Weight reduction, exercise, and dietary modification decrease insulin\nresistance and correct hyperglycemia in some patients with type 2 diabetes. However, most patients require\npharmacologic intervention with oral glucose-lowering agents. As the disease progresses, β-cell function declines,\nand insulin therapy is often needed to achieve satisfactory glucose levels (Figure 24.5).\nFigure 24.5 Duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus, sufficiency of endogenous insulin, and\nrecommended sequence of therapy.\n889\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 890 ---\n\nIII.  Insulin and Insulin Analogs\nInsulin [IN-su-lin] is a polypeptide hormone consisting of two peptide chains that are connected by disulfide bonds.\nIt is synthesized as a precursor (proinsulin) that undergoes proteolytic cleavage to form insulin and C-peptide, both\nof which are secreted by the β cells of the pancreas. [Note: Because insulin undergoes significant hepatic and renal\nextraction, plasma insulin levels may not accurately reflect insulin production. Thus, measurement of C-peptide\nprovides a better index of insulin levels.] Insulin secretion is regulated by blood glucose levels, certain amino acids,\nother hormones, and autonomic mediators. Secretion is most often triggered by increased blood glucose, which is\ntaken up by the glucose transporter into the β cells of the pancreas. There, it is phosphorylated by glucokinase,\nwhich acts as a glucose sensor. The products of glucose metabolism enter the mitochondrial respiratory chain and\ngenerate adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The rise in ATP levels causes a blockade of K+ channels, leading to\nmembrane depolarization and an influx of Ca2+. The increase in intracellular Ca2+ causes pulsatile insulin\nexocytosis.\n890\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 891 ---\n\nA.  Mechanism of action\nExogenous insulin is administered to replace absent insulin secretion in type 1 diabetes or to supplement insufficient\ninsulin secretion in type 2 diabetes.\n891\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 892 ---\n\nB.  Pharmacokinetics\nHuman insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology using strains of Escherichia coli or yeast that are\ngenetically altered to contain the gene for human insulin. Modification of the amino acid sequence of human insulin\nproduces insulins with different pharmacokinetic properties. Insulin preparations vary primarily in their onset and\nduration of activity. Dose, injection site, blood supply, temperature, and physical activity can also affect the onset\nand duration of various insulin preparations. Because insulin is a polypeptide, it is degraded in the gastrointestinal\ntract if taken orally. Therefore, it is generally administered by subcutaneous injection, although an inhaled insulin\nformulation is also available. [Note: In a hyperglycemic emergency, regular insulin is administered intravenously\n(IV).] Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (also called the insulin pump) is another method of insulin delivery.\nThis method of administration may be more convenient for some patients, eliminating multiple daily injections of\ninsulin. The pump is programmed to deliver a basal rate of insulin. In addition, it allows the patient to deliver a\nbolus of insulin to cover mealtime carbohydrate intake and compensate for high blood glucose.\n892\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 893 ---\n\nC.  Adverse effects\nHypoglycemia is the most serious and common adverse reaction to insulin ( Figure 24.6). Other adverse effects\ninclude weight gain, local injection site reactions, and lipodystrophy. Lipodystrophy can be minimized by rotation of\ninjection sites. Diabetics with renal insufficiency may require a decrease in insulin dose. Due to the potential for\nbronchospasm with inhaled insulin, patients with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and smokers\nshould not use this formulation.\n893\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 894 ---\n\n894\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 895 ---\n\nFigure 24.6 Adverse effects observed with insulin. [Note: Lipodystrophy is a local\natrophy or hypertrophy of subcutaneous fatty tissue at the site of injections.]\n895\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 896 ---\n\nIV.  Insulin Preparations and Treatment\nInsulin preparations are classified as rapid-, short-, intermediate-, or long-acting. Figure 24.7 summarizes onset of\naction, timing of peak level, and duration of action for the various types of insulin. It is important that clinicians\nexercise caution when adjusting insulin treatment, paying strict attention to the dose and type of insulin.\nFigure 24.7 Onset and duration of action of human insulin and insulin analogs. NPH =\nneutral protamine Hagedorn.\n896\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 897 ---\n\nA.  Rapid-acting and short-acting insulin preparations\nFive preparations fall into this category: regular insulin, insulin lispro [LIS-proe], insulin aspart  [AS-part], insulin\nglulisine [gloo-LYSE-een], and inhaled insulin. Regular insulin is a short-acting, soluble, crystalline zinc insulin.\nInsulin lispro, aspart , and glulisine are classified as rapid-acting insulins. Modification of the amino acid sequence\nof regular insulin produces analogs that are rapid-acting insulins. This modification results in more rapid absorption,\na quicker onset, and a shorter duration of action after subcutaneous injection. Peak levels of insulin lispro are seen at\n30 to 90 minutes, as compared with 50 to 120 minutes for regular insulin. Insulin aspart  and insulin glulisine have\npharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties similar to those of insulin lispro. Inhaled insulin is also\nconsidered rapid-acting. This dry powder formulation is inhaled and absorbed through pulmonary tissue, with peak\nlevels achieved within 45 to 60 minutes. Rapid- or short-acting insulins are administered to mimic the prandial\n(mealtime) release of insulins and to control postprandial glucose. They may also be used in cases where swift\ncorrection of elevated glucose is needed. Rapid- and short-acting insulins are usually used in conjunction with a\nlonger-acting basal insulin that provides control of fasting glucose. Regular insulin should be injected\nsubcutaneously 30 minutes before a meal, whereas rapid-acting insulins are administered in the 15 minutes\npreceding a meal or within 15 to 20 minutes after starting a meal. Rapid-acting insulin suspensions are commonly\nused in external insulin pumps, and they are suitable for IV administration, although regular insulin is most\ncommonly used when the IV route is needed.\n897\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 898 ---\n\nB.  Intermediate-acting insulin\nNeutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin is an intermediate-acting insulin formed by the addition of zinc and\nprotamine to regular insulin. [Note: Another name for this preparation is insulin isophane.] The combination with\nprotamine forms a complex that is less soluble, resulting in delayed absorption and a longer duration of action. NPH\ninsulin is used for basal (fasting) control in type 1 or 2 diabetes and is usually given along with rapid- or short-acting\ninsulin for mealtime control. NPH insulin should be given only subcutaneously (never IV ), and it should not be used\nwhen rapid glucose lowering is needed (for example, diabetic ketoacidosis). Figure 24.8 shows common regimens\nthat use combinations of insulins.\n898\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 899 ---\n\n899\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 900 ---\n\nFigure 24.8 Examples of three regimens that provide both prandial and basal insulin\nreplacement. B = breakfast; L = lunch; S = supper; NPH = neutral protamine Hagedorn.\n900\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 901 ---\n\nC.  Long-acting insulin preparations\nThe isoelectric point of insulin glargine [GLAR-geen] is lower than that of human insulin, leading to formation of a\nprecipitate at the injection site that releases insulin over an extended period. It has a slower onset than NPH insulin\nand a flat, prolonged hypoglycemic effect with no peak ( Figure 24.7). Insulin detemir [deh-TEE-meer] has a fatty\nacid side chain that enhances association to albumin. Slow dissociation from albumin results in long-acting\nproperties similar to those of insulin glargine. Insulin degludec [de-GLOO-dek] remains in solution at physiologic\npH, with a slow release over an extended period. It has the longest half-life of the long-acting insulins. As with NPH\ninsulin, insulin glargine, insulin detemir, and insulin degludec are used for basal control and should only be\nadministered subcutaneously. Long-acting insulins should not be mixed in the same syringe with other insulins,\nbecause doing so may alter the pharmacodynamic profile.\n901\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 902 ---\n\nD.  Insulin combinations\nVarious premixed combinations of human insulins, such as 70% NPH insulin plus 30% regular insulin (Figure 24.8)\nor 50% of each of these, are also available. Use of premixed combinations decreases the number of daily injections\nbut makes it more difficult to adjust individual components of the insulin regimen.\n902\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 903 ---\n\nE.  Standard treatment versus intensive treatment\nStandard insulin therapy involves twice daily injections. In contrast, intensive treatment utilizes three or more\ninjections daily with frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels. The ADA recommends a target mean blood\nglucose level of 154 mg/dL or less (HbA1c ≤ 7%) for most patients, and intensive treatment is more likely to achieve\nthis goal. The frequency of hypoglycemic episodes, coma, and seizures is higher with intensive insulin regimens\n(Figure 24.9A). However, patients on intensive therapy show a significant reduction in microvascular complications\nof diabetes such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy compared to patients receiving standard care ( Figure\n24.9B ). Intensive therapy should not be recommended for patients with long-standing diabetes, significant\nmicrovascular complications, advanced age, and those with hypoglycemic unawareness.\nFigure 24.9 A. Effect of tight glucose control on hypoglycemic episodes in a population\nof patients with type 1 diabetes receiving intensive or standard therapy. B. Effect of\nstandard and intensive care on the long-term complications of diabetes.\n903\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 904 ---\n\nV.  Synthetic Amylin Analog\nAmylin is a hormone that is cosecreted with insulin from β cells following food intake. It delays gastric emptying,\ndecreases postprandial glucagon secretion, and improves satiety. Pramlintide [PRAM-lin-tide] is a synthetic amylin\nanalog that is indicated as an adjunct to mealtime insulin therapy in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\nPramlintide is administered by subcutaneous injection immediately before meals. When pramlintide is initiated, the\ndose of mealtime insulin should be decreased by 50% to avoid a risk of severe hypoglycemia. Other adverse effects\ninclude nausea, anorexia, and vomiting. Pramlintide may not be mixed in the same syringe with insulin, and it\nshould be avoided in patients with diabetic gastroparesis (delayed stomach emptying), cresol hypersensitivity, or\nhypoglycemic unawareness.\n904\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 905 ---\n\nVI.  Glucagon-like Peptide Receptor Agonists\nOral intake of glucose results in a higher secretion of insulin than occurs when an equal load of glucose is given IV.\nThis effect is referred to as the “incretin effect” and is markedly reduced in type 2 diabetes. The incretin effect\noccurs because the gut releases incretin hormones, notably glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent\ninsulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), in response to a meal. Incretin hormones are responsible for 60% to 70% of\npostprandial insulin secretion. Albiglutide [al-bi-GLOO-tide], dulaglutide [doo-la-GLOO-tide], exenatide [EX-e-\nnah-tide], liraglutide [LIR-a-GLOO-tide], lixisenatide [lix-i-SEN-a-tide], and semaglutide [sem-a-GLOO-tide] are\ninjectable GLP-1 receptor agonists used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Liraglutide is also approved to reduce\nthe risk of cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular\ndisease. Two premixed preparations of long-acting insulins and GLP-1 receptor agonists are available: insulin\nglargine plus lixisenatide and insulin degludec plus liraglutide. Use of these combinations may decrease daily\ninsulin requirements and the number of daily injections.\n905\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 906 ---\n\nA.  Mechanism of action\nThese agents are analogs of GLP-1 that exert their activity by improving glucose-dependent insulin secretion,\nslowing gastric emptying time, reducing food intake by enhancing satiety (a feeling of fullness), decreasing\npostprandial glucagon secretion, and promoting β-cell proliferation. Consequently, postprandial hyperglycemia is\nreduced, HbA1c levels decline, and weight loss may occur.\n906\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 907 ---\n\nB.  Pharmacokinetics\nGLP-1 receptor agonists are administered subcutaneously, since they are polypeptides. Albiglutide, dulaglutide,\nliraglutide, and semaglutide are considered long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists. Albiglutide, dulaglutide, and\nsemaglutide are dosed once weekly, while liraglutide is available as a once-daily injection. Lixisenatide is a short-\nacting GLP-1 receptor agonist that is dosed once daily. Exenatide is available as both a short-acting (dosed twice\ndaily) and extended-release preparation (dosed once weekly). Exenatide should be avoided in patients with severe\nrenal impairment.\n907\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 908 ---\n\nC.  Adverse effects\nThe main adverse effects of the incretin mimetics consist of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation. GLP-1\nreceptor agonists have been associated with pancreatitis and should be avoided in patients with chronic pancreatitis.\nLonger-acting agents have been associated with thyroid C-cell tumors in rodents. It is unknown if GLP-1 receptor\nagonists cause these tumors or thyroid carcinoma in humans, although they are contraindicated in patients with a\nhistory of medullary thyroid carcinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2.\n908\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 909 ---\n\nVII.  Oral Agents\nOral agents are useful in the treatment of patients who have type 2 diabetes that is not controlled with diet. Patients\nwho developed diabetes after age 40 and have had diabetes less than 5 years are most likely to respond well to oral\nglucose-lowering agents. Patients with long-standing disease may require a combination of oral agents with or\nwithout insulin to control hyperglycemia. Figure 24.10 summarizes the duration of action of some of the oral\nglucose-lowering drugs, and Figure 24.11 illustrates some of the common adverse effects.\nFigure 24.10 Duration of action of some oral hypoglycemic agents.\n909\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 910 ---\n\nFigure 24.11 Some adverse effects observed with oral hypoglycemic agents.\n910\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 911 ---\n\nA.  Sulfonylureas\nThese agents are classified as insulin secretagogues, because they promote insulin release from the β cells of the\npancreas. The sulfonylureas most used in clinical practice are the second-generation drugs glyburide [GLYE-byoor-\nide], glipizide [GLIP-ih-zide], and glimepiride [GLYE-me-pih-ride].\n1.  Mechanism of action\nThese agents stimulate insulin release from the β cells of the pancreas. Sulfonylureas block ATP-sensitive K+\nchannels, resulting in depolarization, Ca2+ influx, and insulin exocytosis. In addition, sulfonylureas may reduce\nhepatic glucose production and increase peripheral insulin sensitivity.\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\nGiven orally, these drugs bind to serum proteins, are metabolized by the liver, and are excreted in the urine and\nfeces. The duration of action ranges from 12 to 24 hours.\n3.  Adverse effects\nAdverse effects of the sulfonylureas include hypoglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and weight gain. They should be used\nwith caution in hepatic or renal insufficiency, since accumulation of sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia. Renal\nimpairment is a particular problem for glyburide, as it may increase the duration of action and increase the risk of\nhypoglycemia significantly. Glipizide or glimepiride are safer options in renal dysfunction and in elderly patients.\nFigure 24.12 summarizes some drug interactions with sulfonylureas.\nFigure 24.12 Drugs interacting with sulfonylureas.\n911\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 912 ---\n\n912\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 913 ---\n\nB.  Glinides\nThis class of agents includes repaglinide [re-PAG-lin-ide] and nateglinide [nuh-TAY-gli-nide]. Glinides are also\nconsidered insulin secretagogues.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nLike the sulfonylureas, the glinides stimulate insulin secretion. In contrast to the sulfonylureas, the glinides have a\nrapid onset and a short duration of action. They are particularly effective in the early release of insulin that occurs\nafter a meal and are categorized as postprandial glucose regulators. Glinides should not be used in combination with\nsulfonylureas due to overlapping mechanisms of action and increased risk of serious hypoglycemia.\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\nGlinides should be taken prior to a meal and are well absorbed after oral administration. Both glinides are\nmetabolized to inactive products by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4; see",

These agents should be used with caution in patients with hepatic\nimpairment.\n913\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 914 ---\n\nC.  Biguanides\nMetformin [met-FOR-min], the only biguanide, is classified as an insulin sensitizer. It increases glucose uptake and\nuse by target tissues, thereby decreasing insulin resistance. Unlike sulfonylureas, metformin does not promote\ninsulin secretion. Therefore, the risk of hypoglycemia is far less than that with sulfonylureas. Metformin is also\nuseful in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome, as it reduces insulin resistance seen in this disorder.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nThe main mechanism of action of metformin is reduction of hepatic gluconeogenesis. [Note: Excess glucose\nproduced by the liver is a major source of high blood glucose in type 2 diabetes, accounting for high fasting blood\nglucose.] Metformin also slows intestinal absorption of sugars and improves peripheral glucose uptake and\nutilization. Weight loss may occur because metformin causes loss of appetite. The ADA recommends metformin as\nthe initial drug of choice for type 2 diabetes. Metformin may be used alone or in combination with other oral agents\nor insulin. Hypoglycemia may occur when metformin is taken in combination with insulin or insulin secretagogues,\nso adjustment in dosage may be required.\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\nMetformin is well absorbed after oral administration, is not bound to serum proteins, and is not metabolized.\nExcretion is via the urine.\n3.  Adverse effects\nThese are largely gastrointestinal, including diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects can be alleviated by\ntitrating the dose of metformin slowly and administering doses with meals. Metformin is contraindicated in renal\ndysfunction due to the risk of lactic acidosis. It should be discontinued in cases of acute myocardial infarction,\nexacerbation of heart failure, sepsis, or other disorders that can cause acute renal failure. Metformin should be used\nwith caution in patients older than 80 years and in those with heart failure or alcohol abuse. It should be temporarily\ndiscontinued in patients undergoing procedures requiring IV radiographic contrast. Rarely, potentially fatal lactic\nacidosis has occurred. Long-term use may be associated with vitamin B12 deficiency, and periodic measurement of\nvitamin B12 levels is recommended, especially in patients with anemia or peripheral neuropathy.\n914\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 915 ---\n\nD.  Thiazolidinediones\nThe thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are also insulin sensitizers. The two agents in this class are pioglitazone [pye-oh-\nGLI-ta-zone] and rosiglitazone [roe-si-GLIH-ta-zone]. Although insulin is required for their action, the TZDs do not\npromote its release from the β cells, so hyperinsulinemia is not a risk.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nThe TZDs lower insulin resistance by acting as agonists for the peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-γ\n(PPARγ), a nuclear hormone receptor. Activation of PPARγ regulates the transcription of several insulin responsive\ngenes, resulting in increased insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle. The TZDs can be used\nas monotherapy or in combination with other glucose-lowering agents or insulin. The dose of insulin may have to be\nlowered when used in combination with these agents. The ADA recommends pioglitazone as a second- or third-line\nagent for type 2 diabetes. Rosiglitazone is less utilized due to concerns regarding cardiovascular adverse effects.\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\nPioglitazone and rosiglitazone are well absorbed after oral administration and are extensively bound to serum\nalbumin. Both undergo extensive metabolism by different CYP450 isozymes (see",

Renal elimination of pioglitazone is negligible, with the majority of active drug and\nmetabolites excreted in the bile and eliminated in the feces. Metabolites of rosiglitazone are primarily excreted in the\nurine. No dosage adjustment is required in renal impairment.\n3.  Adverse effects\nLiver toxicity has occasionally been reported with these drugs, and baseline and periodic monitoring of liver\nfunction is recommended. Weight gain can occur because TZDs may increase subcutaneous fat and cause fluid\nretention. [Note: Fluid retention can worsen heart failure. These drugs should be avoided in patients with severe\nheart failure.] TZDs have been associated with osteopenia and increased fracture risk in women. Pioglitazone may\nalso increase the risk of bladder cancer. Additionally, rosiglitazone carries a boxed warning about the potential\nincreased risk of myocardial infarction and angina with the use of this agent.\n915\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 916 ---\n\nE.  a-Glucosidase inhibitors\nAcarbose [AY-car-bose] and miglitol  [MIG-li-tol] are oral agents used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nLocated in the intestinal brush border, α-glucosidase enzymes break down carbohydrates into glucose and other\nsimple sugars that can be absorbed. Acarbose and miglitol  reversibly inhibit α-glucosidase enzymes. When taken at\nthe start of a meal, these drugs delay the digestion of carbohydrates, resulting in lower postprandial glucose levels.\nSince they do not stimulate insulin release or increase insulin sensitivity, these agents do not cause hypoglycemia\nwhen used as monotherapy. However, when used with insulin secretagogues or insulin, hypoglycemia may develop.\n[Note: It is important that hypoglycemia in this context be treated with glucose rather than sucrose, because sucrase\nis also inhibited by these drugs.]\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\nAcarbose is poorly absorbed. It is metabolized primarily by intestinal bacteria, and some of the metabolites are\nabsorbed and excreted into the urine. Miglitol  is very well absorbed but has no systemic effects. It is excreted\nunchanged by the kidney.\n3.  Adverse effects\nThe most common adverse effects are flatulence, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping. Adverse effects limit the use of\nthese agents in clinical practice. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease, colonic ulceration, or intestinal\nobstruction should not use these drugs.\n916\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 917 ---\n\nF.  Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors\nAlogliptin [al-oh-GLIP-tin], linagliptin [lin-a-GLIP-tin], saxagliptin [sax-a-GLIP-tin], and sitagliptin [si-ta-GLIP-\ntin] are oral dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nThese drugs inhibit the enzyme DPP-4, which is responsible for the inactivation of incretin hormones such as GLP-1\n(Figure 24.13). Prolonging the activity of incretin hormones increases release of insulin in response to meals and\nreduces inappropriate secretion of glucagon. DPP-4 inhibitors may be used as monotherapy or in combination with\nsulfonylureas, metformin, TZDs, or insulin. Treatment guidelines do not recommend the combination of DPP-4\ninhibitors with GLP-1 receptor agonists for management of diabetes due to overlapping mechanisms and toxicity.\nUnlike GLP-1 receptor agonists, these drugs do not cause satiety or fullness and are weight neutral.\nFigure 24.13 Mechanism of action of DPP-4 inhibitors. DPP-4 = dipeptidyl peptidase-4.\nGIP = glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide; GLP-1 = glucagon-like peptide-1.\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\nThe DPP-4 inhibitors are well absorbed after oral administration. Food does not affect the extent of absorption.\nAlogliptin and sitagliptin are mostly excreted unchanged in the urine. Saxagliptin is metabolized via CYP450 3A4/5\nto an active metabolite. The primary route of elimination for saxagliptin and the metabolite is renal. Linagliptin is\nprimarily eliminated via the enterohepatic system. All DPP-4 inhibitors except linagliptin require dosage\nadjustments in renal dysfunction.\n3.  Adverse effects\nIn general, DPP-4 inhibitors are well tolerated, with the most common adverse effects being nasopharyngitis and\nheadache. Although infrequent, pancreatitis has occurred with the use of DPP-4 inhibitors. Agents in this class may\nalso increase the risk of severe, disabling joint pain. Alogliptin and saxagliptin have also been shown to increase the\nrisk of heart failure hospitalizations and should be used with caution in patients with or at risk for heart failure.\n917\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 918 ---\n\nG.  Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors\nCanagliflozin [kan-a-gli-FLOE-zin], dapagliflozin [dap-a-gli-FLOE- zin], empagliflozin [em-pa-gli-FLOE-zin], and\nertugliflozin [er-too-gli-FLOE-zin] are oral agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Empagliflozin is also\nindicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nThe sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) is responsible for reabsorbing filtered glucose in the tubular lumen of\nthe kidney. By inhibiting SGLT2, these agents decrease reabsorption of glucose, increase urinary glucose excretion,\nand lower blood glucose. Inhibition of SGLT2 also decreases reabsorption of sodium and causes osmotic diuresis.\nTherefore, SGLT2 inhibitors may reduce systolic blood pressure. However, they are not indicated for the treatment\nof hypertension.\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\nThese agents are given once daily in the morning. Canagliflozin should be taken before the first meal of the day. All\ndrugs are mainly metabolized by glucuronidation to inactive metabolites. These agents should be avoided in patients\nwith renal dysfunction.\n3.  Adverse effects\nThe most common adverse effects with SGLT2 inhibitors are female genital mycotic infections (for example,\nvulvovaginal candidiasis), urinary tract infections, and urinary frequency. Hypotension has also occurred,\nparticularly in the elderly or patients on diuretics. Thus, volume status should be evaluated prior to starting these\nagents. Ketoacidosis has been reported with use of SGLT2 inhibitors, and these agents should be used with caution\nin patients with risk factors that predispose to ketoacidosis (for example, alcohol abuse and caloric restriction related\nto surgery or illness).\n918\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 919 ---\n\nH.  Other agents\nBoth the dopamine agonist bromocriptine and the bile acid sequestrant colesevelam produce modest reductions in\nHbA1c. The mechanism of action of glucose lowering is unknown for both of these drugs. Although bromocriptine\nand colesevelam are indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, their modest efficacy, adverse effects, and pill\nburden limit their use in clinical practice.\nFigure 24.14 provides a summary of the oral antidiabetic agents and GLP-1 receptor agonists.\nFigure 24.14 Summary of oral agents and GLP-1 receptor agonists used to treat diabetes.\n⇔ = little or no change; DPP-4 = dipeptidyl peptidase-4; GLP-1 = glucagon-like peptide-\n1; SGLT2 = sodium–glucose cotransporter 2.\nFigure 24.15 shows treatment guidelines for type 2 diabetes.\n919\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 920 ---\n\nFigure 24.15 Treatment guidelines for type 2 diabetes.\n920\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 921 ---\n\n24.1\n24.2\n24.3\n24.4\n24.5\n24.6Study Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nWhich of the following statements is correct regarding insulin glargine?\nA.  It is primarily used to control postprandial hyperglycemia.\nB.  It is a “peakless” insulin.\nC.  The prolonged duration of activity is due to slow dissociation from albumin.\nD.  It should not be used in a regimen with insulin lispro or glulisine.\nCorrect answer = B. Insulin glargine has a relatively flat, prolonged hypoglycemic effect. Because of this, it is\nused for basal glucose control, not postprandial. The prolonged duration is due to its low pH, which leads to\nprecipitation at the injection site and resultant extended action. Insulin glargine is often used for basal control in a\nregimen where insulin lispro, glulisine, or aspart are used for mealtime glucose control. [Note: Glargine should\nnot be combined with other insulins in the same syringe, as it may alter the pharmacodynamic properties of the\nmedication.]\nMC is a patient with type 2 diabetes currently being treated with insulin detemir. The physician determines\nthat MC needs additional insulin therapy for control of postprandial glucose. Which agent is most\nappropriate to add at this time?\nA.  Insulin degludec\nB.  NPH insulin\nC.  Insulin lispro\nD.  NPH/regular 70/30 insulin\nCorrect answer = C. Insulin lispro is a rapid-acting insulin that has an onset of action within 15 to 30 minutes.\nRapid-acting insulins are administered to mimic the prandial (mealtime) release of insulin and control\npostprandial glucose levels. Insulin degludec is a long-acting insulin used to control fasting glucose levels. NPH\ninsulin is an intermediate-acting insulin also used for basal (fasting) control. NPH/regular 70/30 insulin is a\nmixture of NPH (intermediate-acting) and regular (short-acting) insulin. The patient is already on a long-acting\ninsulin (detemir) for basal control, and another insulin for basal control is not warranted.\nWhich class of oral diabetes drugs is paired most appropriately with its primary mechanism of action?\nA.  DPP-4 inhibitor—inhibits breakdown of complex carbohydrates\nB.  SGLT2 inhibitor—increases urinary excretion of glucose\nC.  Sulfonylurea—increases insulin sensitivity\nD.  Thiazolidinedione—decreases hepatic gluconeogenesis\nCorrect answer = B. SGLT2 inhibitors work by inhibiting the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), resulting\nin decreased reabsorption of glucose in the kidney and increased urinary excretion. Sulfonylureas work primarily\nby increasing insulin secretion through stimulation of the β cells in the pancreas. DPP-4 inhibitors work by\ninhibiting breakdown of incretins, thereby increasing postprandial insulin secretion, decreasing postprandial\nglucagon, etc. TZDs work primarily by increasing insulin sensitivity.\nWhich of the following statements is characteristic of metformin?\nA.  Metformin contains a boxed warning due to the potential for increased risk of myocardial infarction.\nB.  Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production.\nC.  Metformin can be used safely in patients with renal dysfunction.\nD.  Weight gain is a common adverse effect.\nCorrect answer = B. Metformin works by inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis. The primary adverse effects\nassociated with metformin are gastrointestinal and in rare cases, lactic acidosis. Metformin does not carry a\nwarning for increased risk of myocardial infarction (this is the case for rosiglitazone). Metformin is\ncontraindicated in renal dysfunction due to the risk of lactic acidosis. Unlike the sulfonylureas and insulin, weight\ngain is not an adverse effect, and some patients actually lose weight due to GI side effects.\nWhich is the most appropriate initial oral agent for management of type 2 diabetes in patients with no other\ncomorbid conditions?\nA.  Glipizide\nB.  Empagliflozin\nC.  Metformin\nD.  Pioglitazone\nCorrect answer = C. Metformin is the preferred initial agent for management of type 2 diabetes. See Figure 24.15.\nA 64-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes is diagnosed with heart failure. Which of the\nfollowing medications would be a poor choice for controlling her diabetes?\nA.  Exenatide921\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 922 ---\n\n24.7\n24.8\n24.9\n24.10B.  Glyburide\nC.  Pioglitazone\nD.  Insulin\nCorrect answer = C. The TZDs (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) can cause fluid retention and lead to a worsening\nof heart failure. They should be used with caution and dose reduction, if at all, in patients with heart failure.\nExenatide, glyburide, and insulin do not have precautions for use in heart failure patients.\nKD is a 69-year-old male with type 2 diabetes and chronic pancreatitis. Which of the following diabetes\nmedications is contraindicated in this patient?\nA.  Glipizide\nB.  Insulin lispro\nC.  Metformin\nD.  Dulaglutide\nCorrect answer = D. Dulaglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist. Although infrequent, GLP-1 receptor agonists have\nbeen associated with pancreatitis and should be avoided in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Glipizide, insulin\nlispro, and metformin have not been associated with an increased risk of pancreatitis.\nWhich of the following drugs for diabetes is LEAST likely to cause weight gain?\nA.  Liraglutide\nB.  Pioglitazone\nC.  Repaglinide\nD.  Insulin glulisine\nCorrect answer = A. GLP-1 receptor agonists are usually associated with weight loss due to their ability to\nenhance satiety. All of the other agents are associated with weight gain.\nHB is a 55-year-old obese female who has had type 2 diabetes for 10 years. She is currently being treated\nwith metformin, but her HbA1c is above goal. She has a history of heart failure and chronic obstructive\npulmonary disorder. Her physician would like to add a medication that will not cause any weight gain.\nWhich of the following would be most appropriate to control HB’s diabetes?\nA.  Linagliptin\nB.  Glimepiride\nC.  Pioglitazone\nD.  Inhaled insulin\nCorrect answer = A. Linagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, and this class of medications is effective in lowering HbA1c\nlevels without causing weight gain (they are usually weight neutral). Sulfonylureas (glimepiride) are associated\nwith weight gain and should be avoided in this obese patient. TZDs (pioglitazone) should be avoided in patients\nwith heart failure. Because of the potential for bronchospasm associated with inhaled insulin, it should be avoided\nin patients with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder and asthma.\nWhich of the following diabetes medications is most appropriately paired with an adverse effect associated\nwith its use?\nA.  Canagliflozin—urinary tract infections\nB.  Nateglinide—heart failure\nC.  Glipizide—weight loss\nD.  Liraglutide—lactic acidosis\nCorrect answer = A. Adverse effects of canagliflozin are genital mycotic infections, urinary tract infections, and\nurinary frequency. Nateglinide may cause hypoglycemia but has not been associated with heart failure.\nSulfonylureas are associated with weight gain. Lactic acidosis is a rare but serious side effect of metformin (not\nliraglutide).922\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 923 ---\n\n25\nEstrogens and Androgens\nKaren Whalen\n923\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 924 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nEstrogens and androgens are sex hormones produced by the gonads. These hormones are necessary for conception,\nembryonic maturation, and development of primary and secondary sexual characteristics at puberty. The sex\nhormones are used therapeutically for contraception, management of menopausal symptoms, and replacement\ntherapy in hormone deficiency. Several antagonists are effective in the treatment or prevention of hormone-\nresponsive cancers. Sex hormones are synthesized from the precursor, cholesterol, in a series of steps that includes\nshortening of the hydrocarbon side chain and hydroxylation of the steroid nucleus. Aromatization is the last step in\nestrogen synthesis. Figure 25.1 lists the sex hormones discussed in this chapter.\n924\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 925 ---\n\n925\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 926 ---\n\nFigure 25.1 Summary of sex hormones. *Available in many combinations with a\nprogestin. **Available in combination with ethinyl estradiol. [Note: Dienogest is\navailable in combination with estradiol valerate.] IUD = intrauterine device. (Figure\ncontinues on next page)\n926\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 927 ---\n\nII.  Estrogens\nEstradiol  [ess-tra-DYE-ole] is the most potent estrogen produced and secreted by the ovary. It is the principal\nestrogen in premenopausal women. Estrone [ESS-trone] is a metabolite of estradiol  that has approximately one-third\nthe estrogenic potency of estradiol . Estrone is the primary circulating estrogen after menopause, and it is generated\nmainly from conversion of dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA] in adipose tissue. Estriol  [ess-TRI-ole], another\nmetabolite of estradiol , is significantly less potent than is estradiol . It is present in significant amounts during\npregnancy, because it is synthesized by the placenta. Synthetic estrogens, such as ethinyl estradiol  [ETH-ih-nil ess-\ntra-DYE-ole], undergo less first-pass metabolism than do naturally occurring hormones and, thus, are effective when\nadministered orally at lower doses.\n927\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 928 ---\n\nA.  Mechanism of action\nAfter dissociation from their binding sites on sex hormone–binding globulin or albumin in the plasma, steroid\nhormones (for example, estradiol ) diffuse across the cell membrane and bind with high affinity to specific nuclear\nreceptor proteins (Figure 25.2). The activated steroid–receptor complex interacts with nuclear chromatin to initiate\nhormone-specific RNA synthesis. This results in the synthesis of specific proteins that mediate a number of\nphysiologic functions. [Note: The steroid hormones may elicit the synthesis of different RNA species in diverse\ntarget tissues and, therefore, are both receptor and tissue specific.] Other pathways that require these hormones have\nbeen identified that lead to more rapid actions.\nFigure 25.2 Transcriptional regulation by intracellular steroid hormone receptors.

Therapeutic uses\nEstrogens are most frequently used for contraception and postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT).

        "content": "Chapter 27).\n1.  Postmenopausal HT\nThe primary indication for estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women is menopausal symptoms, such as vasomotor\ninstability (for example, “hot flashes” or “hot flushes”) and vaginal atrophy (Figure 25.3). A common oral\npreparation used for the treatment of menopausal symptoms is conjugated equine estrogens (obtained from urine of\npregnant mares), which primarily contains sulfate esters of estrone and equilin. Other estrone-based oral\npreparations include esterified estrogens and estropipate [ES-troe-PIP-ate]. Transdermal preparations of estradiol\nare also effective in treating menopausal symptoms. For women with an intact uterus, a progestogen is always\nincluded with the estrogen therapy, because the combination reduces the risk of endometrial carcinoma associated\nwith unopposed estrogen. Women who have undergone a hysterectomy may use estrogen alone. [Note: The potency\nof estrogen used in HT is substantially less than that of estrogens used in contraception. Thus, the adverse effects of\nestrogen replacement therapy are usually less pronounced than those seen in women taking estrogen for\ncontraceptive purposes.] Use of HT has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and breast\ncancer. Thus, HT should be prescribed at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time to relieve\nmenopausal symptoms. Women who only have urogenital symptoms, such as vaginal atrophy, should be treated\nwith vaginal rather than systemic estrogen to minimize the risks of use.\n929\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 930 ---\n\n930\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 931 ---\n\nFigure 25.3 Benefits associated with postmenopausal estrogen replacement.\n2.  Contraception\nThe combination of an estrogen and progestogen provides effective contraception via the oral, transdermal, or\nvaginal route.\n3.  Other uses\nEstrogen therapy mimicking the natural cyclic pattern, and usually in combination with a progestogen, is instituted\nto stimulate development of secondary sex characteristics in young women with primary hypogonadism. Similarly,\nreplacement therapy is used for women who have hormonal deficiencies due to surgical menopause or premature\novarian failure.\n931\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 932 ---\n\nC.  Pharmacokinetics\n1.  Naturally occurring estrogens\nThese agents and their esterified or conjugated derivatives are readily absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract,\nskin, and mucous membranes. Taken orally, estradiol  is rapidly metabolized (and partially inactivated) by the\nmicrosomal enzymes of the liver. Micronized estradiol  has better bioavailability. Although estradiol  is subject to\nfirst-pass metabolism, it is still effective when taken orally.\n2.  Synthetic estrogens\nThese compounds, such as ethinyl estradiol  and estradiol valerate are well absorbed after oral administration.\nEstradiol valerate is a prodrug of estradiol  which is rapidly cleaved to estradiol  and valeric acid. The synthetic\nestrogens are fat soluble, stored in adipose tissue, and slowly released. These compounds have a prolonged action\nand a higher potency compared to the natural estrogens.\n3.  Metabolism\nBioavailability of estradiol  after oral administration is low due to first-pass metabolism. To reduce first-pass\nmetabolism, estradiol  may be administered via a transdermal patch, topical formulation (gel or spray), intravaginal\npreparation (tablet, cream, or ring), or injection. Following oral administration, estradiol  is metabolized to estrone\nand estriol . Estrogens are transported in the blood bound to serum albumin or sex hormone–binding globulin.\nEstradiol  and its metabolites subsequently undergo glucuronide and sulfate conjugation. In addition, smaller\namounts of estrone and estriol  are metabolized by the hepatic CYP3A4 isoenzyme. Metabolites are mainly excreted\nin the urine. The glucuronide and sulfate metabolites are also subject to enterohepatic recirculation. These\ncompounds are secreted into the bile, hydrolyzed by gut bacteria, and then reabsorbed.\n932\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 933 ---\n\nD.  Adverse effects\nNausea and breast tenderness are among the most common adverse effects of estrogen therapy. In addition, the risk\nof thromboembolic events, myocardial infarction, and breast and endometrial cancer is increased with the use of\nestrogen therapy. [Note: The increased risk of endometrial cancer can be offset by including a progestogen along\nwith the estrogen therapy.] Other effects of estrogen therapy are shown in Figure 25.4.\nFigure 25.4 Some adverse effects associated with estrogen therapy. BP = blood pressure.\n933\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 934 ---\n\nIII.  Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators\nSERMs are a class of estrogen-related compounds that display selective agonism or antagonism for estrogen\nreceptors depending on the tissue type. This category includes tamoxifen, raloxifene, bazedoxifene, clomiphene, and\nospemifene.\n934\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 935 ---\n\nA.  Mechanism of action\nTamoxifen [tah-MOKS-ih-fen] and raloxifene [rah-LOX-ih-feen] compete with estrogen for binding to the estrogen\nreceptor in breast tissue. [Note: Normal breast growth is stimulated by estrogens. Therefore, some hormone-\nresponsive breast tumors regress following treatment with these agents.] In addition, raloxifene acts as an estrogen\nagonist in bone, leading to decreased bone resorption, increased bone density, and decreased vertebral fractures\n(Figure 25.5). Unlike estrogen and tamoxifen, raloxifene does not stimulate growth of the endometrium and,\ntherefore, does not predispose to endometrial cancer. Raloxifene also lowers serum total cholesterol and low-density\nlipoprotein (LDL). Like raloxifene, bazedoxifene [BA-ze-DOX-i-feen] antagonizes the action of estrogen on the\nuterus. The drug reduces the risk of endometrial hyperplasia with estrogen use. Clomiphene [KLOE-mi-feen] acts as\na partial estrogen agonist and interferes with the negative feedback of estrogens on the hypothalamus. This effect\nincreases the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone and gonadotropins, thereby leading to stimulation of\novulation.\nFigure 25.5 Hip bone density increases with raloxifene in postmenopausal women.\n935\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 936 ---\n\nB.  Therapeutic uses\nTamoxifen is currently used in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, or as adjuvant therapy following\nmastectomy or radiation for breast cancer. Both tamoxifen and raloxifene can be used as prophylactic therapy to\nreduce the risk of breast cancer in high-risk patients. Raloxifene is also approved for the prevention and treatment of\nosteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Clomiphene is used in the treatment of infertility. Ospemifene is indicated\nfor the treatment of dyspareunia (painful sexual intercourse) related to menopause. Bazedoxifene is available in a\ncombination product with conjugated estrogens. The combination is indicated for the treatment of menopausal\nsymptoms in women with an intact uterus.\n936\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 937 ---\n\nC.  Pharmacokinetics\nThe SERMs are rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Tamoxifen is extensively metabolized by cytochrome\nP450 system, including the formation of active metabolites via the CYP3A4/5 and CYP2D6 isoenzymes. [Note:\nPatients with a genetic polymorphism in CYP2D6 may produce less active metabolite, resulting in diminished\nactivity of tamoxifen.] Raloxifene is rapidly converted to glucuronide conjugates through first-pass metabolism.\nThese agents undergo enterohepatic cycling, and the primary route of excretion is through the bile into feces.\n937\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 938 ---\n\nD.  Adverse effects\nThe most frequent adverse effects of tamoxifen are hot flashes and nausea. Due to its estrogenic activity in the\nendometrium, endometrial hyperplasia and malignancies have been reported with tamoxifen therapy. This has led to\nrecommendations for limiting the length of time on the drug for some indications. Because it is metabolized by\nvarious CYP450 isoenzymes, tamoxifen is subject to many drug interactions. [Note: Tamoxifen is also an inhibitor of\nP-glycoprotein.] Some CYP450 inhibitors may prevent the formation of active metabolites of tamoxifen and\npossibly reduce the efficacy (for example, amiodarone, haloperidol , paroxetine). Hot flashes and leg cramps are\ncommon adverse effects with raloxifene. In addition, there is an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis and\npulmonary embolism. Women who have a past or active history of venous thromboembolic events should not take\nthe drug. Adverse effects of clomiphene are dose-related and include headache, nausea, vasomotor flushes, visual\ndisturbances, and ovarian enlargement. Use of clomiphene increases the risk of multiple gestation, usually twins.\nOspemifene may stimulate endometrial growth, and addition of a progestogen in women with an intact uterus should\nbe considered.\n938\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 939 ---\n\nIV.  Progestogens\nProgesterone, the natural progestogen, is produced in response to luteinizing hormone (LH) by both females\n(secreted by the corpus luteum, primarily during the second half of the menstrual cycle, and by the placenta) and by\nmales (secreted by the testes). It is also synthesized by the adrenal cortex in both sexes.\n939\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 940 ---\n\nA.  Mechanism of action\nProgestogens exert their effects in a manner analogous to that of the other steroid hormones. In females,\nprogesterone promotes the development of a secretory endometrium that can accommodate implantation of a newly\nforming embryo. The high levels of progesterone that are released during the second half of the menstrual cycle (the\nluteal phase) inhibit the production of gonadotropin and, therefore, prevent further ovulation. If conception takes\nplace, progesterone continues to be secreted, maintaining the endometrium in a favorable state for the continuation\nof the pregnancy and reducing uterine contractions. If conception does not take place, the release of progesterone\nfrom the corpus luteum ceases abruptly. The decline in progesterone stimulates the onset of menstruation. Figure\n25.6 summarizes the hormones produced during the menstrual cycle.\nFigure 25.6 The menstrual cycle with plasma levels of pituitary and ovarian hormones\nand a schematic representation of changes in the morphology of the uterine lining. FSH =\nfollicle-stimulating hormone; LH = luteinizing hormone.\n940\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 941 ---\n\n941\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 942 ---\n\nB.  Therapeutic uses\nThe major clinical uses of progestogens are for contraception or hormone replacement therapy. For both\ncontraception and HT, progestogens are often used in combination with estrogens. Progesterone is not used as a\ncontraceptive therapy because of its rapid metabolism, resulting in low bioavailability. Synthetic progestogens (that\nis, progestins) used for contraception are more stable to first-pass metabolism, allowing lower doses when\nadministered orally. These agents include desogestrel  [des-oh-JES-trel], dienogest  [dye-EN-oh-jest], drospirenone\n[droe-SPY-re-none], levonorgestrel  [lee-voe-nor-JES-trel], norethindrone [nor-ETH-in-drone], norethindrone\nacetate, norgestimate [nor-JES-tih-mate], and norgestrel  [nor-JES-trel]. Medroxyprogesterone [me-DROK-see-\nproe-JES-ter-one] acetate is an injectable contraceptive, and the oral form is a common progestin component of\npostmenopausal HT. Progestogens are also used for the control of dysfunctional uterine bleeding, treatment of\ndysmenorrhea, and management of endometriosis and infertility.\n942\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 943 ---\n\nC.  Pharmacokinetics\nA micronized preparation of progesterone is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. It has a short half-life in the\nplasma and is metabolized by the liver to pregnanediol and glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. The metabolites are\nexcreted primarily in the urine. Synthetic progestins are less rapidly metabolized. Oral medroxyprogesterone acetate\nhas a half-life of 30 hours. When injected intramuscularly or subcutaneously, the drug has a half-life of about 40 to\n50 days and provides contraception for approximately 3 months. The other progestins have half-lives of 7 to 30\nhours, allowing for once-daily dosing.\n943\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 944 ---\n\nD.  Adverse effects\nThe major adverse effects associated with the use of progestins are headache, depression, weight gain, and changes\nin libido (Figure 25.7). Progestins that are derived from 19-nortestosterone (for example, norethindrone,\nnorethindrone acetate, norgestrel , levonorgestrel ) possess some androgenic activity because of their structural\nsimilarity to testosterone and can cause acne and hirsutism. Less androgenic progestins, such as norgestimate and\ndrospirenone, may be preferred in women with acne. Drospirenone may raise serum potassium due to\nantimineralocorticoid effects, and concurrent use with other drugs that increase potassium (for example, angiotensin-\nconverting enzyme inhibitors) may increase the risk of hyperkalemia.\nFigure 25.7 Some adverse effects associated with progestin therapy.\n944\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 945 ---\n\n945\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 946 ---\n\nE.  Antiprogestin\nMifepristone [mih-feh-PRIH-stone] (also designated as RU-486) is a progesterone antagonist. Administration of this\ndrug results in termination of pregnancy due to interference with the progesterone needed to maintain pregnancy.\nMifepristone is often combined with the prostaglandin analog misoprostol  to induce uterine contractions. The major\nadverse effects are abdominal pain, uterine bleeding, and the possibility of an incomplete abortion.\n946\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 947 ---\n\nV.  Contraceptives\nContraceptives may be hormonal or nonhormonal (for example, condom, diaphragm, contraceptive sponge, and\ncopper intrauterine device). Figure 25.8 outlines the frequency of use for various hormonal and nonhormonal\nmethods of contraception. An overview of the hormonal methods of contraception is provided below.\nFigure 25.8 Comparison of contraceptive use among U.S. women ages 15 to 44 years.\n*Patch, implant, fertility awareness methods, and other barrier methods (for example,\ndiaphragm).\n947\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 948 ---\n\nA.  Types of hormonal contraceptives\n1.  Combination oral contraceptives\nA combination of estrogen and progestin is the most common type of oral contraceptive. [Note: The most common\nestrogen in combination pills is ethinyl estradiol . The most common progestins are norethindrone, norethindrone\nacetate, levonorgestrel , desogestrel , norgestimate, and drospirenone.] These preparations are highly effective in\nachieving contraception (Figure 25.9). Monophasic combination pills contain a constant dose of estrogen and\nprogestin given over 21 to 24 days. Triphasic oral contraceptive products attempt to mimic the natural female cycle\nand usually contain a constant dose of estrogen with increasing doses of progestin given over 21 days. With most\noral contraceptives, active pills are taken for 21 to 24 days, followed by 4 to 7 days of placebo, for a total regimen of\n28 days. Withdrawal bleeding occurs during the hormone-free (placebo) interval. Use of extended-cycle\ncontraception (84 active pills followed by 7 days of placebo) results in less frequent withdrawal bleeding. A\ncontinuous oral contraceptive product (active pills taken every day) is also available.\nFigure 25.9 Comparison of failure rate for various methods of contraception with typical\nuse. Longer bars indicate a higher failure rate—that is, more pregnancies.\n2.  Transdermal patch\nThe contraceptive transdermal patch contains ethinyl estradiol  and the progestin norelgestromin. During the 28-day\ncycle, one patch is applied each week for 3 weeks to the abdomen, upper torso, or buttock. No patch is worn during\nthe 4th week, and withdrawal bleeding occurs. The transdermal patch has efficacy comparable to that of the oral\ncontraceptives, but it is less effective in women weighing greater than 90 kg. Total estrogen exposure with the\ntransdermal patch may be significantly greater than that seen with oral contraceptives.\n948\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 949 ---\n\n3.  Vaginal ring\nThe contraceptive vaginal ring contains ethinyl estradiol  and etonogestrel . The ring is inserted into the vagina and\nleft in place for 3 weeks. After 3 weeks, the ring is removed, and withdrawal bleeding occurs during the 4th week.\n4.  Progestin-only pills\nProgestin-only pills (the “mini-pill”) contain a progestin, usually norethindrone, and are administered daily to\ndeliver a low, continuous dosage of drug. These preparations are less effective than combination oral contraceptives,\nand irregular menstrual cycles may be more frequent. Progestin-only pills may be used in patients who are breast-\nfeeding (unlike estrogen, progestins do not have an effect on milk production) or who have intolerance or\ncontraindications to estrogen-containing products.\n5.  Injectable progestin\nMedroxyprogesterone acetate is a contraceptive that is administered via intramuscular or subcutaneous injection\nevery 3 months. This product provides high sustained levels of progestin, and many women experience amenorrhea\nwith medroxyprogesterone acetate. In addition, return to fertility may be delayed for several months after\ndiscontinuation. Weight gain is a common adverse effect. Medroxyprogesterone acetate may contribute to bone loss\nand predispose patients to osteoporosis and/or fractures. Therefore, the drug should not be continued for more than 2\nyears unless the patient is unable to tolerate other contraceptive options.\n6.  Progestin implants\nAfter subdermal placement in the upper arm, the etonogestrel  implant offers contraception for up to 3 years. The\nimplant is as reliable as sterilization, and the contraceptive effect is reversible when removed. [Note: Progestin\nimplants and intrauterine devices are known as long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC).] Adverse effects\ninclude irregular menstrual bleeding and headaches. The etonogestrel  implant has not been studied in women who\nweigh more than 130% of ideal body weight and may be less effective in this population.\n7.  Progestin intrauterine device\nVarious levonorgestrel -releasing intrauterine devices offer a highly effective method of contraception for 3 to 5\nyears. This is a suitable method of contraception for women who desire long-term contraception. It should be\navoided in patients with pelvic inflammatory disease or a history of ectopic pregnancy. The levonorgestrel\nintrauterine device is a highly effective treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding. [Note: The nonhormonal copper\nintrauterine device provides contraception for up to 10 years.]\n8.  Postcoital contraception\nPostcoital or emergency contraception reduces the probability of pregnancy after intercourse without effective\ncontraception (Figure 25.10) to between 0.2% and 3%. The most common method of emergency contraception uses\na single high dose of levonorgestrel . For maximum effectiveness, emergency contraception should be taken as soon\nas possible after unprotected intercourse and preferably within 72 hours. The levonorgestrel  emergency\ncontraceptive regimens are generally better tolerated than the estrogen–progestin combination regimens. An\nalternative emergency contraceptive is the progesterone agonist/antagonist ulipristal  [ue-li-PRIS-tal]. It is indicated\nfor emergency contraception within 5 days of unprotected intercourse.\n949\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 950 ---\n\nFigure 25.10 Risk of pregnancy after unprotected intercourse in young couples in their\nmid-twenties.\n950\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 951 ---\n\nB.  Mechanism of action\nExogenously administered estrogen in contraceptives provides negative feedback which blunts release of follicle-\nstimulating hormone (FSH) by the pituitary gland and progestin inhibits LH secretion, thus preventing ovulation.\nProgestin also thickens the cervical mucus, thus hampering the transport of sperm. Withdrawal of the progestin\nstimulates menstrual bleeding during the placebo week.\n951\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 952 ---\n\nC.  Adverse effects\nThe incidence of adverse effects with contraceptives is determined by the specific compounds and combinations\nused. The most common adverse effects with estrogens are breast fullness, fluid retention, headache, and nausea.\nIncreased blood pressure may also occur. Progestins may be associated with depression, changes in libido, hirsutism,\nand acne. Although rare, thromboembolism, thrombophlebitis, myocardial infarction, and stroke may occur with use\nof estrogen-containing contraceptives. These severe adverse effects are most common among women who are over\nage 35 and smoke, and estrogen-containing contraceptives should be avoided in this population. Progestin-only\nproducts are preferred in older women who are smokers, due to a lower risk of severe adverse effects. The incidence\nof cervical cancer may be increased with hormonal contraceptives, because women are less likely to use barrier\nmethods of contraception that reduce exposure to human papillomavirus, the primary risk factor for cervical cancer.\n[Note: Oral contraceptives are associated with a decreased risk of endometrial and ovarian cancer.] Oral\ncontraceptives are contraindicated in the presence of cerebrovascular and thromboembolic disease, estrogen-\ndependent neoplasms, liver disease, and pregnancy. Drugs that induce the CYP3A4 isoenzyme (for example,\nrifampin and bosentan) significantly reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptives. Concurrent use of these agents with\noral contraceptives should be avoided, or an alternate barrier method of contraception should be utilized. Antibiotics\nthat alter normal gastrointestinal flora may reduce enterohepatic recycling of estrogen, thereby diminishing\neffectiveness of oral contraceptives. Patients should be warned of the possible interaction between antibiotics and\noral contraceptives, along with the potential need for an alternate method of contraception during antibiotic therapy.\n952\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 953 ---\n\nVI.  Androgens\nThe androgens are a group of steroids that have anabolic and/or masculinizing effects in both males and females.\nTestosterone [tess-TOSS-te-rone], the most important androgen in humans, is synthesized by Leydig cells in the\ntestes and, in smaller amounts, by thecal cells in the ovaries and by the adrenal gland in both sexes. Other androgens\nsecreted by the testes are 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), androstenedione, and DHEA in small amounts. In adult\nmales, testosterone secretion by Leydig cells is controlled by gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the\nhypothalamus, which stimulates the anterior pituitary gland to secrete FSH and LH. Testosterone or its active\nmetabolite, DHT, inhibits production of these specific trophic hormones through a negative feedback loop and, thus,\nregulates testosterone production (Figure 25.11). The androgens are required for 1) normal maturation in the male,\n2) sperm production, 3) increased synthesis of muscle proteins and hemoglobin, and 4) decreased bone resorption.\nSynthetic modifications of the androgen structure modify solubility and susceptibility to metabolism (thus\nprolonging the half-life of the hormone), and separate anabolic and androgenic effects.\n953\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 954 ---\n\n954\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 955 ---\n\nFigure 25.11 Regulation of secretion of testosterone. DHT = 5-α-dihydrotestosterone;\nLH = luteinizing hormone.\n955\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 956 ---\n\nA.  Mechanism of action\nLike the estrogens and progestins, androgens bind to a specific nuclear receptor in a target cell. Although\ntestosterone itself is the active ligand in muscle and liver, in other tissues, it must be metabolized to derivatives,\nsuch as DHT. For example, after diffusing into the cells of the prostate, seminal vesicles, epididymis, and skin,\ntestosterone is converted by 5α-reductase to DHT, which binds to the receptor.\n956\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 957 ---\n\nB.  Therapeutic uses\nAndrogenic steroids are used for males with primary hypogonadism (caused by testicular dysfunction) or secondary\nhypogonadism (due to failure of the hypothalamus or pituitary). [Note: Testosterone replacement should only be\nused for males with hypogonadism related to medical conditions and not low testosterone associated with aging.]\nAnabolic steroids can be used to treat chronic wasting associated with human immunodeficiency virus or cancer. An\nunapproved use of anabolic steroids is to increase lean body mass, muscle strength, and endurance in athletes and\nbody builders (see below). Because of the potential misuse of testosterone and its derivatives, these agents are\nclassified as controlled substances. DHEA (a precursor of testosterone and estrogen) has been touted as an antiaging\nhormone as well as a “performance enhancer.” There is no definitive evidence that it slows aging, however, or that it\nimproves performance at normal therapeutic doses. Formulations of testosterone or its derivatives (for example,\nmethyltestosterone) may be used in combination with estrogen for women with menopausal symptoms unresponsive\nto estrogen alone. Danazol  [DAH-nah-zole], a weak androgen, is used in the treatment of endometriosis and\nfibrocystic breast disease. [Note: Danazol  also possesses antiestrogenic activity.] Weight gain, acne, decreased\nbreast size, deepening voice, increased libido, and increased hair growth are among the adverse effects.\n957\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 958 ---\n\nC.  Pharmacokinetics\n1.  Testosterone\nThis agent is ineffective orally because of inactivation by first-pass metabolism. Therefore, testosterone is\nadministered via a transdermal patch, topical gel or solution, buccal tablet, or implantable pellet. Esters of\ntestosterone (for example, testosterone cypionate or enanthate) are administered intramuscularly. The esterified\nformulations are more lipid soluble and have an increased duration of action up to several weeks. Figure 25.12\nshows serum levels of testosterone achieved by injection and by a transdermal patch in hypogonadal men. Active\nmetabolites of testosterone include DHT and estradiol , with activity related to the formation of DHT. Inactive\nmetabolites are excreted primarily in the urine. Testosterone and its esters demonstrate a 1:1 relative ratio of\nandrogenic to anabolic activity.\n958\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 959 ---\n\n959\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 960 ---\n\nFigure 25.12 A. Administration and fate of androgens. IM = intramuscular. B. Serum\ntestosterone concentrations after administration by injection or transdermal patch to\nhypogonadal men. The yellow band indicates the upper and lower limits of normal.\n2.  Testosterone derivatives\nAlkylation of the 17α position of testosterone is associated with less hepatic metabolism and allows oral\nadministration of the hormone. Methyltestosterone and fluoxymesterone [floo-oks-i-MES-te-rone] are examples of\norally administered testosterone derivatives. Oxandrolone [ox-AN-droe-lone] and oxymetholone [OKS-ee-METH-\noh-lone] are orally active 17α-alkylated derivatives of DHT. Oxandrolone has anabolic activity 3 to 13 times that of\ntestosterone.\n960\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 961 ---\n\nD.  Adverse effects\n1.  In females\nAndrogens can cause masculinization, acne, growth of facial hair, deepening of the voice, male pattern baldness, and\nexcessive muscle development. Menstrual irregularities may also occur. Testosterone should not be used by\npregnant women because of possible virilization of the female fetus.\n2.  In males\nExcess androgen can cause priapism, impotence, decreased spermatogenesis, gynecomastia, and cosmetic changes\nsuch as those described for females. Androgens can also stimulate growth of the prostate.\n3.  In children\nAndrogens can cause abnormal sexual maturation and growth disturbances resulting from premature closing of the\nepiphyseal plates.\n4.  General effects\nAndrogens can increase serum LDL and lower serum high-density lipoprotein levels. They may also cause fluid\nretention and peripheral edema. Testosterone replacement therapy has been associated with a possible increased risk\nof myocardial infarction and stroke. Hepatic adverse effects have been associated with the 17α-alkylated androgens.\nLocal skin irritation is a common adverse effect with topical formulations.\n5.  In athletes\nUse of anabolic steroids (for example, DHEA) by athletes can cause premature closing of the epiphysis of the long\nbones, which stunts growth and interrupts development. High doses taken by young athletes may result in reduction\nof testicular size, hepatic abnormalities, increased aggression (“roid rage”), major mood disorders, and other adverse\neffects described above.\n961\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 962 ---\n\nE.  Antiandrogens\nAntiandrogens counter male hormonal action by interfering with the synthesis of androgens or by blocking their\nreceptors. Antiandrogens, such as flutamide [FLOO-tah-mide], bicalutamide [bye-ka-LOO-ta-mide], enzalutamide\n[enz-a-LOO-ta-mide], and nilutamide [nye-LOO-ta-mide], act as competitive inhibitors of androgens at the target\ncell and are effective orally for the treatment of prostate cancer (see",

She has no\npertinent past medical or surgical history. Which would be most appropriate for her symptoms?\nA.  Conjugated estrogens vaginal cream\nB.  Estradiol  transdermal patch\nC.  Oral estradiol  and medroxyprogesterone acetate\nD.  Injectable medroxyprogesterone acetate\nCorrect answer = C. Estrogen vaginal cream only treats vaginal symptoms of menopause such as vaginal atrophy\nand does not treat hot flushes. Since this patient has an intact uterus, a progestin such as medroxyprogesterone\nneeds to be used along with the estrogen to prevent the development of endometrial hyperplasia. Unopposed\nestrogen (for example, the estradiol transdermal patch) should not be used. Injectable medroxyprogesterone\nacetate is used for contraception.\nA 70-year-old woman is being treated with raloxifene for osteoporosis. Which is a concern with this therapy?\nA.  Breast cancer\nB.  Endometrial cancer\nC.  Venous thrombosis\nD.  Hypercholesterolemia\nCorrect answer = C. Raloxifene can increase the risk of venous thromboembolism. Unlike estrogen and\ntamoxifen, raloxifene does not result in an increased incidence of endometrial cancer. Raloxifene lowers the risk\nof breast cancer in high-risk women, and it also lowers LDL cholesterol.\nWhich is the most appropriate oral contraceptive for a patient with moderate acne?\nA.  Ethinyl estradiol /levonorgestrel\nB.  Ethinyl estradiol /norethindrone acetate\nC.  Ethinyl estradiol /norgestimate\nD.  Ulipristal\nCorrect answer = C. The progestins levonorgestrel and norethindrone acetate may have androgenic activity and\ncontribute to acne. Norgestimate has less androgenic activity and is preferred for this patient. Ulipristal is an\nemergency contraceptive and should not be used as a regular method of contraception.\nA 25-year-old woman is using injectable medroxyprogesterone acetate as a method of contraception. Which\nadverse effect is a concern if she wishes to use this therapy long-term?\nA.  Hyperkalemia\nB.  Male pattern baldness\nC.  Osteoporosis\nD.  Weight loss\nCorrect answer = C. Medroxyprogesterone acetate may contribute to bone loss and predispose patients to\nosteoporosis and/or fractures. Therefore, the drug should not be continued for more than 2 years if possible. The\ndrug often causes weight gain, not weight loss. The other adverse effects are not associated with\nmedroxyprogesterone.\nWhich contraceptive method provides long-acting reversible contraception (LARC)?\nA.  Contraceptive vaginal ring\nB.  Intrauterine device\nC.  Extended-cycle oral contraceptives\nD.  Transdermal contraceptive patch\nCorrect answer = B. The progestin-only intrauterine devices provide contraception for 3 to 5 years, depending on\nthe device. The etonogestrel  subdermal implant is another LARC that provides contraception for 3 years. The\ncontraceptive vaginal ring is worn for 3 weeks at a time, and the transdermal patch for 1 week at a time. Extended\ncycle oral contraceptives must be administered daily.\nWhich is the most effective form of contraception with typical use?\nA.  Combined oral contraceptives\nB.  Progestin-only “mini-pill”\nC.  Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injection\nD.  Subdermal progestin implant\nCorrect answer = D. See Figure 25.9. The subdermal implant has a very low failure rate, since it does not require\nadherence of the patient after implantation. Progestin-only pills are less effective than combined oral963\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 964 ---\n\n25.7\n25.8\n25.9\n25.10contraceptives and the depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injection.\nA 36-year-old woman requests birth control. She has no medical conditions, and she smokes one pack of\ncigarettes per day. Which would be the most appropriate to recommend?\nA.  Vaginal contraceptive ring\nB.  Transdermal contraceptive patch\nC.  Progestin-only “mini-pill”\nD.  Combination oral contraceptive pill\nCorrect answer = C. Progestin-only products are preferred in older women who are smokers, due to a lower risk\nof severe adverse effects, such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Estrogen-containing contraceptives are not\nrecommended in women over the age of 35 who are smokers. The vaginal contraceptive ring, transdermal\ncontraceptive patch, and combination oral contraceptive pills all contain estrogen.\nA 22-year-old woman requests emergency contraception after unprotected intercourse that occurred 1 day\nago. She has no medical conditions. Which agent is most appropriate?\nA.  Ethinyl estradiol /norgestimate\nB.  Etonogestrel\nC.  Levonorgestrel\nD.  Mifepristone\nCorrect answer = C. A single dose of levonorgestrel  is preferred for emergency contraception and should be\nadministered within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse for best efficacy. Estrogen/progestin regimens are less\nused for emergency contraception due to a higher incidence of adverse effects such as nausea/vomiting.\nEtonogestrel  is a progestin used in the contraceptive ring and implant. Mifepristone is a progesterone antagonist\nused to terminate pregnancy once it has occurred.\nA 35-year-old woman is experiencing infertility due to anovulation. Which agent is most appropriate for this\npatient?\nA.  Clomiphene\nB.  Ospemifene\nC.  Raloxifene\nD.  Ulipristal\nCorrect answer = A. Clomiphene is a SERM that interferes with negative feedback of estrogens on the\nhypothalamus, thereby increasing the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone and gonadotropins, and\nleading to stimulation of ovulation. Ospemifene is a SERM indicated for the treatment of dyspareunia. Raloxifene\nis a SERM used in the prevention of breast cancer and osteoporosis. Ulipristal  is a progesterone\nagonist/antagonist used as an emergency contraceptive.\nUse of testosterone is most appropriate in which patient?\nA.  A 25-year-old competitive athlete\nB.  A 30-year-old man with hypogonadism due to testicular injury\nC.  A 50-year-old man with low testosterone related to aging\nD.  A 65-year-old man with low testosterone and a history of myocardial infarction\nCorrect answer = B. Testosterone should only be used only for hypogonadism associated with documented\nmedical conditions and not low testosterone associated with aging. Testosterone replacement may increase the\nrisk of cardiovascular events and should be used with caution in patients with a history of myocardial infarction\nand heart disease. 964\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 965 ---\n\n26\nAdrenal Hormones\nShannon Miller and Karen Whalen\n965\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 966 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nThe adrenal cortex secretes two types of corticosteroids (glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids; Figure 26.1) and\nthe adrenal androgens. The adrenal cortex has three zones, and each zone synthesizes a different type of steroid\nhormone from cholesterol (Figure 26.2). The outer zona glomerulosa produces mineralocorticoids (for example,\naldosterone) that are responsible for regulating salt and water metabolism. The middle zona fasciculata synthesizes\nglucocorticoids (for example, cortisol) that are involved with metabolism and response to stress. The inner zona\nreticularis secretes adrenal androgens (see",

ACTH = adrenocorticotropic\nhormone; CRH = corticotropin-releasing hormone.\n968\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 969 ---\n\nII.  Corticosteroids\nCorticosteroids differ in their metabolic (glucocorticoid) and electrolyte-regulating (mineralocorticoid) activity. The\ncorticosteroids bind to specific intracellular cytoplasmic receptors in target tissues. Glucocorticoid receptors are\nwidely distributed throughout the body, whereas mineralocorticoid receptors are confined mainly to excretory\norgans, such as the kidney, colon, salivary glands, and sweat glands. Both types of receptors are found in the brain.\nAfter dimerizing, the receptor–hormone complex recruits coactivator (or corepressor) proteins and translocates into\nthe nucleus, where it attaches to gene promoter elements. There it acts as a transcription factor to turn genes on\n(when complexed with coactivators) or off (when complexed with corepressors), depending on the tissue ( Figure\n26.3). Because of this mechanism, some effects of corticosteroids take hours to days to occur. This section describes\nnormal actions and therapeutic uses of corticosteroids.\n969\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 970 ---\n\n970\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 971 ---\n\nFigure 26.3 Gene regulation by glucocorticoids.\n971\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 972 ---\n\nA.  Glucocorticoids\nCortisol is the principal human glucocorticoid. Normally, its production is diurnal, with a peak in early morning\nfollowed by a decline and then a secondary, smaller peak in late afternoon. Stress and levels of the circulating\nsteroid influence secretion. The effects of cortisol are many and diverse. In general, all glucocorticoids:\n1.  Promote normal intermediary metabolism\nGlucocorticoids stimulate hepatic glucose production by enhancing expression of enzymes involved in\ngluconeogenesis. They mobilize amino acids and stimulate lipolysis, thereby providing the building blocks and\nenergy for glucose synthesis.\n2.  Increase resistance to stress\nBy raising plasma glucose levels, glucocorticoids provide the body with energy to combat stress caused by trauma,\nfright, infection, bleeding, or debilitating disease. [Note: Glucocorticoid insufficiency may result in hypoglycemia\n(for example, during stressful periods or fasting).]\n3.  Alter blood cell levels in plasma\nGlucocorticoids cause a decrease in eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes by redistributing them\nfrom the circulation to lymphoid tissue. Glucocorticoids also increase hemoglobin, erythrocytes, platelets, and\npolymorphonuclear leukocytes.\n4.  Possess anti-inflammatory action\nPotent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activities are the most important therapeutic properties of\nglucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids lower circulating lymphocytes and inhibit the ability of leukocytes and\nmacrophages to respond to mitogens and antigens. Glucocorticoids also decrease the production and release of\nproinflammatory cytokines. They inhibit phospholipase A2, which blocks the release of arachidonic acid (the\nprecursor of the prostaglandins and leukotrienes), resulting in anti-inflammatory actions. Lastly, these agents\ninfluence the inflammatory response by stabilizing mast cell and basophil membranes, thereby decreasing histamine\nrelease.\n5.  Affect other systems\nHigh levels of glucocorticoids provide negative feedback to reduce ACTH production and affect the endocrine\nsystem by suppressing synthesis of glucocorticoids and thyroid-stimulating hormone. In addition, adequate cortisol\nlevels are essential for normal glomerular filtration. Corticosteroids may adversely affect other systems (see Adverse\nEffects below).\n972\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 973 ---\n\nB.  Mineralocorticoids\nMineralocorticoids help to control fluid status and concentration of electrolytes, especially sodium and potassium.\nAldosterone acts on mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts in the kidney, causing\nreabsorption of sodium, bicarbonate, and water. Conversely, aldosterone decreases reabsorption of potassium,\nwhich, with H+, is lost in the urine. Enhancement of sodium reabsorption by aldosterone also occurs in\ngastrointestinal mucosa and in sweat and salivary glands. [Note: Elevated aldosterone levels may cause alkalosis and\nhypokalemia, retention of sodium and water, and increased blood volume and blood pressure. Hyperaldosteronism is\ntreated with spironolactone.]\n973\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 974 ---\n\nC.  Therapeutic uses of the corticosteroids\nSemisynthetic derivatives of corticosteroids vary in anti-inflammatory potency, mineralocorticoid activity, and\nduration of action (Figure 26.4). These agents are used in replacement therapy and in the treatment of severe allergic\nreactions, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, other inflammatory disorders, and some cancers.\nFigure 26.4 Pharmacologic effects and duration of action of some commonly used\nnatural and synthetic corticosteroids. Activities are all relative to that of hydrocortisone,\nwhich is considered to be 1.\n1.  Replacement therapy for primary adrenocortical insufficiency (Addison disease)\nAddison disease is caused by adrenal cortex dysfunction (diagnosed by lack of response to ACTH administration).\nHydrocortisone [hye-droe-KOR-tih-sone], which is identical to natural cortisol, is given to correct the deficiency.\nFailure to do so results in death. Two-thirds of the daily dosage of hydrocortisone is administered in the morning\nand one-third in the afternoon, mimicking the normal diurnal variation in cortisol levels. Administration of\nfludrocortisone [floo-droe-KOR-tih-sone], a potent synthetic mineralocorticoid, may also be necessary to correct\nmineralocorticoid deficiency.\n2.  Replacement therapy for secondary or tertiary adrenocortical insufficiency\nThese disorders are caused by a defect in CRH production by the hypothalamus or in ACTH production by the\npituitary. Hydrocortisone is used for treatment of these deficiencies.\n3.  Diagnosis of Cushing syndrome\nCushing syndrome is caused by hypersecretion of glucocorticoids (hypercortisolism) that results from excessive\nrelease of ACTH by the anterior pituitary or an adrenal tumor. [Note: Chronic treatment with high doses of\nglucocorticoids is a frequent cause of iatrogenic Cushing syndrome.] Cortisol levels (urine, plasma, and saliva) and\nthe dexamethasone [dex-a-METH-a-sone] suppression test are used to diagnose Cushing syndrome. The synthetic\nglucocorticoid dexamethasone suppresses cortisol release in normal individuals, but not those with Cushing\nsyndrome.\n4.  Replacement therapy for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)\nCAH is a group of diseases resulting from an enzyme defect in the synthesis of one or more of the adrenal steroid\nhormones. CAH may lead to virilization in females due to overproduction of adrenal androgens. Treatment requires\nadministration of sufficient corticosteroids to suppress release of CRH and ACTH and normalize hormone levels.\nThis decreases production of adrenal androgens. The choice of replacement hormone depends on the specific\nenzyme defect.\n5.  Relief of inflammatory symptoms\nCorticosteroids significantly reduce inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory skin\nconditions, including redness, swelling, heat, and tenderness. These agents are important for symptom control in\npersistent asthma, as well as treatment of exacerbations of asthma and inflammatory bowel disease. In osteoarthritis,\nintraarticular corticosteroids may be used for treatment of a disease flare. Corticosteroids are not curative in these\ndisorders.974\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 975 ---\n\n6.  Treatment of allergies\nCorticosteroids are beneficial in the treatment of allergic rhinitis, as well as drug, serum, and transfusion allergic\nreactions. In the treatment of allergic rhinitis and asthma, fluticasone [floo-TIK-a-sone] and others (see Figure 26.5)\nare inhaled into the respiratory tract from a metered dose dispenser. This minimizes systemic effects, reducing or\neliminating the use of oral corticosteroids.\n975\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 976 ---\n\n976\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 977 ---\n\nFigure 26.5 Routes of administration and elimination of corticosteroids.

Consequently, a regimen of betamethasone or dexamethasone\nadministered intramuscularly to the mother within 48 hours proceeding premature delivery can accelerate lung\nmaturation in the fetus and prevent respiratory distress syndrome.\n977\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 978 ---\n\nD.  Pharmacokinetics\n1.  Absorption and fate\nCorticosteroids are readily absorbed after oral administration. Selected compounds may be administered\nintravenously, intramuscularly, intra-articularly, topically, or via inhalation or intranasal delivery (Figure 26.5). All\ntopical and inhaled glucocorticoids are absorbed to some extent and, therefore, have the potential to suppress the\nhypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. After absorption, glucocorticoids are greater than 90% bound to plasma\nproteins, mostly corticosteroid-binding globulin or albumin. Corticosteroids are metabolized by the liver microsomal\noxidizing enzymes. The metabolites are conjugated to glucuronic acid or sulfate and excreted by the kidney. [Note:\nThe half-life of corticosteroids may increase substantially in hepatic dysfunction.] Prednisone [PRED-nih-sone] is\npreferred in pregnancy because it minimizes steroid effects on the fetus. It is a prodrug that is not converted to the\nactive compound, prednisolone [pred-NIH-so-lone], in the fetal liver. Any prednisolone formed in the mother is\nbiotransformed to prednisone by placental enzymes.\n2.  Dosage\nFactors that should be considered in determining the dosage of corticosteroids include glucocorticoid versus\nmineralocorticoid activity, duration of action, type of preparation, and time of day when the drug is administered.\nWhen large doses of corticosteroids are required for more than 2 weeks, suppression of the HPA axis occurs.\nAlternate-day administration of corticosteroids may prevent this adverse effect by allowing the HPA axis to\nrecover/function on days the hormone is not taken.\n978\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 979 ---\n\nE.  Adverse effects\nCommon adverse effects of long-term corticosteroid therapy are often dose related (Figure 26.6). For example, in\nrheumatoid arthritis, the daily dose of prednisone was the strongest predictor of occurrence of adverse effects\n(Figure 26.7). Osteoporosis is the most common adverse effect due to the ability of glucocorticoids to suppress\nintestinal Ca2+ absorption, inhibit bone formation, and decrease sex hormone synthesis. Patients are advised to take\ncalcium and vitamin D supplements. Bisphosphonates may also be useful in the treatment of glucocorticoid-induced\nosteoporosis. [Note: Increased appetite is not necessarily an adverse effect. In fact, it is one of the reasons for the use\nof prednisone in cancer chemotherapy.] The classic Cushing-like syndrome (redistribution of body fat, puffy face,\nhirsutism, and increased appetite) is observed in excess corticosteroid replacement. Cataracts may also occur with\nlong-term corticosteroid therapy. Hyperglycemia may develop and lead to diabetes mellitus. Diabetic patients should\nmonitor blood glucose and adjust medications accordingly if taking corticosteroids. Topical therapy can cause skin\natrophy, ecchymosis, and purple striae.\nFigure 26.6 Some commonly observed effects of long-term corticosteroid therapy. BP =\nblood pressure.\n979\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 980 ---\n\nFigure 26.7 Probability of remaining free of a serious adverse event in patients with\nrheumatoid arthritis treated with no or different doses of prednisone.\n980\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 981 ---\n\nF.  Discontinuation\nSudden discontinuation of these drugs can cause serious consequences if the patient has suppression of the HPA\naxis. In this case, abrupt removal of corticosteroids causes acute adrenal insufficiency that can be fatal. This risk,\ncoupled with the possibility that withdrawal could exacerbate the disease, means that the dose must be tapered\nslowly according to individual tolerance. The patient must be monitored carefully.\n981\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 982 ---\n\nG.  Inhibitors of adrenocorticoid biosynthesis or function\nSeveral substances are therapeutically useful as inhibitors of the synthesis or function of adrenal steroids:\nketoconazole, spironolactone, and eplerenone.\n1.  Ketoconazole\nKetoconazole [kee-toe-KON-ah-zole] is an antifungal agent that strongly inhibits all gonadal and adrenal steroid\nhormone synthesis. It is used in the treatment of patients with Cushing syndrome.\n2.  Spironolactone\nThis antihypertensive drug competes for the mineralocorticoid receptor and, thus, inhibits sodium reabsorption in\nthe kidney. Spironolactone [speer-oh-no-LAK-tone] also antagonizes aldosterone and testosterone synthesis. It is\neffective for hyperaldosteronism and hepatic cirrhosis, and is used with other standard therapies for treatment of\nheart failure with reduced ejection fraction. It is also useful in the management of hirsutism in women, probably due\nto antiandrogen activity on the hair follicle. Adverse effects include hyperkalemia, gynecomastia, menstrual\nirregularities, and skin rashes.\n3.  Eplerenone\nEplerenone [e-PLER-ih-none] specifically binds to the mineralocorticoid receptor, where it acts as an aldosterone\nantagonist. This specificity avoids the adverse effect of gynecomastia that is associated with spironolactone. It is\napproved for the treatment of hypertension and for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.\n982\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 983 ---\n\n26.1\n26.2\n26.3\n26.4\n26.5\n26.6Study Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nWhich part of the adrenal gland is correctly paired with the type of substance it secretes?\nA.  Adrenal medulla—corticotropin\nB.  Zona fasciculata—cortisol\nC.  Zona glomerulosa—androgens\nD.  Zona reticularis—catecholamines\nCorrect answer = B. The adrenal medulla secretes catecholamines. Corticotropin is secreted by the anterior\npituitary. The zona glomerulosa secretes aldosterone, and the zona reticularis secretes androgens.\nCorticosteroids are useful in the treatment of which of the following disorders?\nA.  Cushing syndrome\nB.  Diabetes\nC.  Hypertension\nD.  Inflammatory bowel disease\nCorrect answer = D. Corticosteroids can increase blood pressure and glucose and are not used in the treatment of\nhypertension or diabetes. Cushing syndrome is an excess secretion of glucocorticoids. Dexamethasone may be\nused in the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome, but not its treatment. Corticosteroids reduce inflammation and can be\nused in the management of inflammatory bowel disease.\nWhich adverse effect commonly occurs with glucocorticoid therapy?\nA.  Glaucoma\nB.  Hyperkalemia\nC.  Weight loss\nD.  Osteoarthritis\nCorrect answer = A. Glucocorticoid therapy may cause hypokalemia, not hyperkalemia. Glucocorticoids also\ncause increased appetite and osteoporosis. Glaucoma is a known potential adverse effect of this class.\nWhich contributes to osteoporosis with long-term use of glucocorticoids?\nA.  Increased excretion of calcium\nB.  Inhibition of calcium absorption\nC.  Stimulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis\nD.  Decreased production of prostaglandins\nCorrect answer = B. Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is attributed to inhibition of calcium absorption and\nbone formation. Increased intake of calcium plus vitamin D and use of bisphosphonates may be indicated.\nGlucocorticoids suppress rather than stimulate the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. The decreased\nproduction of prostaglandins does not play a role in bone formation.\nA child with severe asthma is treated with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids. Which adverse effect is of\nparticular concern?\nA.  Hypoglycemia\nB.  Hirsutism\nC.  Growth suppression\nD.  Cushing syndrome\nCorrect answer = C. Corticosteroids may retard bone growth. Chronic use of the medication may lead to growth\nsuppression, so linear growth should be monitored periodically. Hyperglycemia, not hypoglycemia, is a possible\nadverse effect. Hirsutism and Cushing syndrome are unlikely with the dose that the child receives via inhalation.\nWhich is appropriate for treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia in a child?\nA.  Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)\nB.  Ketoconazole\nC.  Prednisone\nD.  Spironolactone\nCorrect answer = C. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is seen in infancy and childhood. Because cortisol synthesis\nis decreased, feedback inhibition of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) formation and release is also\ndecreased, resulting in enhanced ACTH formation. This in turn leads to increased levels of adrenal androgens\nand/or mineralocorticoids. The treatment is to administer a glucocorticoid, such as hydrocortisone (in infants) or\nprednisone, which restores the feedback inhibition. The other options are inappropriate.983\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 984 ---\n\n26.7\n26.8\n26.9\n26.10A patient with Addison disease treated with hydrocortisone is experiencing dehydration and hyponatremia.\nWhich drug is best to add to the patient’s therapy?\nA.  Dexamethasone\nB.  Fludrocortisone\nC.  Prednisone\nD.  Triamcinolone\nCorrect answer = B. To combat dehydration and hyponatremia, a corticosteroid with high mineralocorticoid\nactivity is needed. Fludrocortisone has the greatest mineralocorticoid activity of the agents provided. The other\ndrugs have little or no mineralocorticoid activity.\nWhich strategy is effective to minimize development of HPA axis suppression in a patient with rheumatoid\narthritis on long-term high-dose corticosteroid therapy?\nA.  Alternate-day administration\nB.  Administration via topical or inhalation route when possible\nC.  Immediate cessation of the corticosteroid\nD.  Administration of two-thirds of the daily dose in the morning and one-third in the afternoon\nCorrect answer = A. Topical or inhaled corticosteroids may minimize HPA axis suppression, but are unlikely to\nbe effective in rheumatoid arthritis. Since the patient has been on long-term therapy, a taper would be necessary.\nAdministration of two-thirds of the dose in the morning and one-third in the afternoon is a strategy to mimic the\nnormal diurnal variation of cortisol secretion, but it does not prevent suppression of the HPA axis. Alternate-day\nadministration is beneficial.\nWhich patient is most likely to have suppression of the HPA axis and require a slow taper of corticosteroid\ntherapy?\nA.  A patient taking 40 mg of prednisone daily for 7 days to treat an asthma exacerbation.\nB.  A patient taking 10 mg of prednisone daily for 3 months for rheumatoid arthritis.\nC.  A patient using mometasone nasal spray daily for 6 months for allergic rhinitis.\nD.  A patient receiving an intraarticular injection of methylprednisolone for osteoarthritis.\nCorrect answer = B. Suppression of the HPA axis usually occurs with higher doses of corticosteroids when used\nfor a duration of 2 weeks or more. Although the dose of prednisone is higher in the asthma patient, the duration of\ntherapy is short, so the risk of HPA axis suppression is lower. The risk of HPA axis suppression is low with\ntopical therapies like intranasal mometasone and with one-time joint injections.\nWhich corticosteroid is most appropriate to administer to a woman in preterm labor to accelerate fetal lung\nmaturation?\nA.  Betamethasone\nB.  Fludrocortisone\nC.  Hydrocortisone\nD.  Prednisone\nCorrect answer = A. A corticosteroid with high glucocorticoid activity is needed to speed fetal lung maturation\nprior to delivery. Betamethasone has high glucocorticoid activity and is one of the recommended drugs in this\ncontext. Dexamethasone is the other. Fludrocortisone mainly has mineralocorticoid activity and is not useful in\nthis situation. Hydrocortisone has much lower glucocorticoid activity. Prednisone has a higher glucocorticoid\nactivity than hydrocortisone, but the fetus is not able to convert it to prednisolone, the active form.984\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 985 ---\n\n27\nDrugs Affecting Bone Metabolism\nKaren Whalen\n985\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 986 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nOsteoporosis, Paget disease, and osteomalacia are disorders of the bone. Osteoporosis is characterized by\nprogressive loss of bone mass and skeletal fragility. Patients with osteoporosis have an increased risk of fractures,\nwhich can cause significant morbidity. Osteoporosis occurs most frequently in postmenopausal women and older\nadults of both sexes. Paget disease is a disorder of bone remodeling that results in disorganized bone formation and\nenlarged or misshapen bones. Unlike osteoporosis, Paget disease is usually limited to one or a few bones. Patients\nmay experience bone pain, bone deformities, or fractures. Osteomalacia is softening of the bones that is most often\nattributed to vitamin D deficiency. [Note: Osteomalacia in children is referred to as rickets]. As osteoporosis is more\ncommon, drug therapy for osteoporosis is the focus of this chapter (Figure 27.1).\nFigure 27.1 Summary of drugs used in the treatment of osteoporosis and other bone\ndisorders.\n986\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 987 ---\n\nII.  Bone Remodeling\nThroughout life, bone undergoes continuous remodeling, with about 10% of the skeleton replaced each year. Bone\nremodeling serves to remove and replace damaged bone and to maintain calcium homeostasis. Osteoclasts are cells\nthat break down bone, a process known as bone resorption. Following bone resorption, osteoblasts or bone-building\ncells synthesize new bone. Crystals of calcium phosphate known as hydroxyapatite are deposited in the new bone\nmatrix during the process of bone mineralization. Bone mineralization is essential for bone strength. Lastly, bone\nenters a resting phase until remodeling begins again. Bone loss occurs when bone resorption exceeds bone formation\nduring the remodeling process. Figure 27.2 shows changes in bone morphology seen in osteoporosis.\nFigure 27.2 Changes in bone morphology seen in osteoporosis.\n987\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 988 ---\n\nIII.  Prevention of Osteoporosis\nStrategies to reduce bone loss in postmenopausal women include adequate dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D,\nweight-bearing exercise, smoking cessation, and avoidance of excessive alcohol intake. Patients with inadequate\ndietary intake of calcium should receive calcium supplementation. Calcium carbonate is an inexpensive and\ncommonly used calcium supplement. It contains 40% elemental calcium and should be taken with meals for best\nabsorption. Calcium citrate (21% elemental calcium) is better tolerated and may be taken with or without food.\nAdverse effects of calcium supplementation include gas and bloating. Calcium may interfere with absorption of iron\npreparations, thyroid replacement, and fluoroquinolone and tetracycline antibiotics, and administration of these\ndrugs should be separated by several hours. Vitamin D is essential for absorption of calcium and bone health, and\nolder patients are often at risk for vitamin D deficiency. Supplementation with vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol ) or\nvitamin D3 (cholecalciferol ) is used for treatment. In addition, patients at risk for osteoporosis should avoid drugs\nthat increase bone loss such as glucocorticoids (Figure 27.3). [Note: Use of glucocorticoids (for example,\nprednisone 5 mg/d or equivalent) for 3 months or more is a significant risk factor for osteoporosis.]\nFigure 27.3 Drugs that can contribute to bone loss or increased fracture risk.\n988\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 989 ---\n\nIV.  Treatment of Osteoporosis\nPharmacologic therapy for osteoporosis is warranted in postmenopausal women and men aged 50 years or over who\nhave a previous osteoporotic fracture, a bone mineral density that is 2.5 standard deviations or more below that of a\nhealthy young adult, or a low bone mass (osteopenia) with a high probability of future fractures.\n989\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 990 ---\n\nA.  Bisphosphonates\nBisphosphonates including alendronate [a-LEND-row-nate], risedronate [rih-SED-row-nate], and zoledronic [zole-\nDROE-nick] acid are preferred agents for treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. These bisphosphonates, along\nwith etidronate [e-TID-row-nate], ibandronate [eye-BAN-dro-nate], pamidronate [pah-MID-row-nate], and\ntiludronate [till-UH-droe-nate], comprise an important drug group used for the treatment of bone disorders such as\nosteoporosis and Paget disease, as well as for treatment of bone metastases and hypercalcemia of malignancy.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nBisphosphonates bind to hydroxyapatite crystals in the bone and decrease osteoclastic bone resorption, resulting in a\nsmall increase in bone mass and a decreased risk of fractures in patients with osteoporosis. The beneficial effects of\nalendronate persist over several years of therapy (Figure 27.4), but discontinuation results in a gradual loss of\neffects.\nFigure 27.4 Effect of alendronate therapy on the bone mineral density of the lumbar\nspine.\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\nThe oral bisphosphonates alendronate, risedronate, and ibandronate are dosed on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis\ndepending on the drug (Figure 27.5). Absorption after oral administration is poor, with less than 1% of the dose\nabsorbed. Food and other medications significantly interfere with absorption of oral bisphosphonates, and guidelines\nfor administration should be followed to maximize absorption (Figure 27.5). Bisphosphonates are rapidly cleared\nfrom the plasma, primarily because they avidly bind to hydroxyapatite in the bone. Once bound to bone, they are\ncleared over a period of hours to years. Elimination is predominantly via the kidney, and bisphosphonates should be\navoided in severe renal impairment. For patients unable to tolerate oral bisphosphonates, intravenous ibandronate\nand zoledronic acid are alternatives.\n990\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 991 ---\n\nFigure 27.5 Dosage formulations and instructions for administration of bisphosphonates\nfor the treatment of osteoporosis. *Frequency of administration for individual agents\nvaries with dosage, with higher doses administered less frequently.\n3.  Adverse effects\nThese include diarrhea, abdominal pain, and musculoskeletal pain. Alendronate, risedronate, and ibandronate are\nassociated with esophagitis and esophageal ulcers. To minimize esophageal irritation, patients should remain upright\nafter taking oral bisphosphonates. Although uncommon, osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femur fractures may\noccur with use of bisphosphonates. The risk of atypical fractures seems to increase with long-term use of\nbisphosphonates. Therefore, current guidelines recommend a drug holiday for some patients after 5 years of oral\nbisphosphonates or 3 years of zoledronic acid. Figure 27.6 shows relative potencies of the bisphosphonates.\nFigure 27.6 Antiresorptive activity of some bisphosphonates.\n991\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 992 ---\n\n992\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 993 ---\n\nB.  Denosumab\nDenosumab [den-OH-sue-mab] is a monoclonal antibody that targets receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B\nligand (RANKL) and inhibits osteoclast formation and function. Denosumab is approved for the treatment of\npostmenopausal osteoporosis in women at high risk of fracture. It is administered via subcutaneous injection every 6\nmonths. Denosumab is considered a first-line agent for osteoporosis, particularly in patients at higher risk of\nfractures. The drug has been associated with an increased risk of infections, dermatological reactions, hypocalcemia,\nand rarely, osteonecrosis of the jaw, and atypical fractures.\n993\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 994 ---\n\nC.  Parathyroid agents\nTeriparatide [ter-ih-PAR-a-tide] is a recombinant form of human parathyroid hormone and abaloparatide [a-bal-oh-\nPAR-a-tide] is an analog of parathyroid hormone-related peptide. These drugs act as agonists at the parathyroid\nhormone receptor, and once-daily subcutaneous administration results in stimulation of osteoblastic activity and\nincreased bone formation and bone strength. By contrast, other drugs for osteoporosis inhibit bone resorption. These\nagents should be reserved for patients at high risk of fractures and those who have failed or cannot tolerate other\nosteoporosis therapies. Both drugs have been associated with hypercalcemia, orthostatic hypotension, and an\nincreased risk of osteosarcoma in rats. Cumulative lifetime use of either agent for more than 2 years is not\nrecommended.\n994\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 995 ---\n\nD.  Selective estrogen receptor modulators\nLower estrogen levels after menopause promote proliferation and activation of osteoclasts, and bone mass can\ndecline rapidly. Estrogen replacement is effective for the prevention of postmenopausal bone loss. However, since\nestrogen may increase the risk of endometrial cancer (when used without a progestin in women with an intact\nuterus), breast cancer, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and coronary events, it is no longer recommended as a\npreventive therapy for osteoporosis. Raloxifene [rah-LOX-ih-feen] is a selective estrogen receptor modulator\napproved for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. It has estrogen-like effects on bone and estrogen\nantagonist effects on breast and endometrial tissue. Therefore, raloxifene increases bone density without increasing\nthe risk of endometrial cancer, and it decreases the risk of invasive breast cancer. Because it has not been shown to\nreduce nonvertebral or hip fractures, raloxifene should be used as an alternative to bisphosphonates or denosumab in\nthe treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Adverse effects include hot flashes, leg cramps, and increased risk of\nvenous thromboembolism.\n995\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 996 ---\n\nE.  Calcitonin\nSalmon calcitonin [cal-SIH-toe-nin] is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in women who are at least 5 years\npostmenopausal. The drug reduces bone resorption, but it is less effective than other agents, and is no longer\nroutinely recommended for the treatment of osteoporosis. A unique property of calcitonin is relief of pain associated\nwith osteoporotic fracture. Therefore, calcitonin is sometimes prescribed for the short-term treatment of patients\nwith a recent painful vertebral fracture. The intranasal formulation is most commonly used in osteoporosis, and\nadverse effects include rhinitis and other nasal symptoms.\n996\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 997 ---\n\n27.1\n27.2\n27.3\n27.4\n27.5\n27.6Study Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nWhich is correct regarding the pharmacokinetics of the bisphosphonates?\nA.  Bisphosphonates are well absorbed after oral administration.\nB.  Food or other medications greatly impair absorption of bisphosphonates.\nC.  Bisphosphonates are mainly metabolized via the cytochrome P450 system.\nD.  Elimination half-life of bisphosphonates ranges from 4 to 6 hours.\nCorrect answer = B. Food and other medications decrease absorption of bisphosphonates, which are already\npoorly absorbed (less than 1%) after oral administration. Bisphosphonates are cleared from the plasma by binding\nto bone and being cleared by the kidney (not metabolized by the CYP450 system). The elimination half-life may\nbe years.\nWhich agent is administered once yearly to treat osteoporosis?\nA.  Abaloparatide\nB.  Denosumab\nC.  Risedronate\nD.  Zoledronic acid\nCorrect answer = D. Zoledronic acid is administered intravenously once per year. Abaloparatide is a daily\nsubcutaneous injection. Denosumab is administered every 6 months, and risedronate is administered daily,\nweekly, or monthly.\nWhich osteoporosis medication works by preferentially stimulating activity of osteoblasts?\nA.  Denosumab\nB.  Ibandronate\nC.  Raloxifene\nD.  Teriparatide\nCorrect answer = D. Teriparatide is a parathyroid hormone analog that has anabolic effects on bone through\nstimulation of osteoblast activity. The other medications work primarily by inhibiting osteoclast activity\n(inhibition of bone resorption).\nWhich best describes the mechanism of action of denosumab in the treatment of osteoporosis?\nA.  Parathyroid hormone analog\nB.  RANKL inhibitor\nC.  Selective estrogen receptor modulator\nD.  Vitamin D analog\nCorrect answer = B. Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-\nB ligand (RANKL) and inhibits osteoclast formation and function.\nA 52-year-old woman has a history of rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, hypertension, and heartburn. Her daily\nmedications include methotrexate, prednisone, metformin, hydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril, and calcium\ncarbonate as needed for heartburn symptoms. She is worried about the risk of osteoporosis as she approaches\nmenopause. Which of her medications is most likely to contribute to the risk of developing osteoporosis?\nA.  Calcium carbonate\nB.  Hydrochlorothiazide\nC.  Lisinopril\nD.  Prednisone\nCorrect answer = D. Glucocorticoids (for example, prednisone at a dose of ≥ 5 mg per day for greater than 3\nmonths) are a significant risk factor for osteoporosis. The other medications have not been shown to increase the\nrisk of osteoporosis, and calcium carbonate and hydrochlorothiazide (diuretic that increases calcium retention)\nmay be beneficial for patients at risk of osteoporosis.\nA 65-year-old woman who has been diagnosed with postmenopausal osteoporosis has no history of fractures\nand no other pertinent medical conditions. Which is most appropriate for management of her osteoporosis?\nA.  Alendronate\nB.  Calcitonin\nC.  Denosumab\nD.  Raloxifene\nCorrect answer = A. Bisphosphonates are first-line therapy for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women without\ncontraindications. Raloxifene is an alternative that may be less efficacious (especially for nonvertebral and hip\nfractures), and calcitonin is not recommended. Denosumab is best used for patients at high risk of fractures.997\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 998 ---\n\n27.7\n27.8\n27.9\n27.10A 55-year-old woman with postmenopausal osteoporosis has a past medical history of ethanol abuse,\nalcoholic liver disease, erosive esophagitis, and hypothyroidism. Which is the primary reason oral\nbisphosphonates should be used with caution in this patient?\nA.  Age\nB.  Erosive esophagitis\nC.  Liver disease\nD.  Thyroid disease\nCorrect answer = B. Bisphosphonates are known to cause esophageal irritation and should be used with caution in\na patient with a history of erosive esophagitis. Age is not a factor for consideration in bisphosphonate use. Liver\ndisease is not a contraindication to bisphosphonate use, since bisphosphonates are mainly cleared via the kidney.\nThyroid disease is not a contraindication to bisphosphonate use, although overaggressive replacement of thyroid\nmay contribute to osteoporosis.\nA 70-year-old woman is being started on ibandronate once monthly for the treatment of osteoporosis. Which\nis important to communicate to this patient?\nA.  Take this medication with orange juice to increase absorption.\nB.  Take this medication after meals to minimize stomach upset.\nC.  Remain upright for at least 60 minutes after taking this medication.\nD.  Adverse effects may include blood clots and leg cramps.\nCorrect answer = C. Patients need to remain upright for 60 minutes after ibandronate (30 minutes for other\nbisphosphonates). Ibandronate should be given on an empty stomach with plain water only. Bisphosphonates,\nunlike raloxifene, are not associated with blood clots and leg cramps.\nUse of which agent for osteoporosis should be limited to no more than 2 years?\nA.  Calcitonin\nB.  Denosumab\nC.  Teriparatide\nD.  Zoledronic acid\nCorrect answer = C. Use of the recombinant parathyroid hormone teriparatide should be limited to 2 years. Use\nbeyond 2 years has not been studied, and is not recommended. The other agents do not have such limitations.\nA patient has been taking alendronate for postmenopausal osteoporosis for 5 years with a slight increase in\nbone mineral density and no occurrence of fractures. Risk of which adverse effect might warrant\nconsideration of a drug holiday from alendronate in this patient?\nA.  Atypical femur fractures\nB.  Esophagitis\nC.  Osteosarcoma\nD.  Rhinitis\nCorrect answer = A. Atypical femur fractures are associated with long-term use of bisphosphonates (greater than\n5 years). Therefore, a drug holiday might be considered since the patient has had no fractures. Esophagitis, while\na side effect of bisphosphonate therapy, can be prevented with appropriate administration. Osteosarcoma is\nassociated with the parathyroid hormone analogs, and rhinitis is associated with intranasal calcitonin.998\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 999 ---\n\nUNIT VI\nChemotherapeutic Drugs\n999\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1000 ---\n\n28\nPrinciples of Antimicrobial Therapy\nJamie Kisgen\n1000\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1001 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nAntimicrobial therapy takes advantage of the biochemical differences that exist between microorganisms and human\nbeings. Antimicrobial drugs are effective in the treatment of infections because of their selective toxicity; that is,\nthey have the ability to injure or kill an invading microorganism without harming the cells of the host. In most\ninstances, the selective toxicity is relative rather than absolute, requiring that the concentration of the drug be\ncarefully controlled to attack the microorganism, while still being tolerated by the host.\n1001\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1002 ---\n\nII.  Selection of Antimicrobial Agents\nSelection of the most appropriate antimicrobial agent requires knowledge of 1) the identity of the organism, 2) the\nsusceptibility of the organism to a particular agent, 3) the site of the infection, 4) patient factors, 5) the safety and\nefficacy of the agent, and 6) the cost of therapy. However, most patients require empiric therapy (immediate\nadministration of drug(s) prior to bacterial identification and susceptibility testing).\n1002\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1003 ---\n\nA.  Identification of the infecting organism\nCharacterizing the organism is central to selection of appropriate therapy. A rapid assessment of the nature of the\npathogen can sometimes be made on the basis of the Gram stain, which is particularly useful in identifying the\npresence and morphologic features of microorganisms in body fluids that are normally sterile (blood, cerebrospinal\nfluid [CSF], pleural fluid, synovial fluid, peritoneal fluid, and urine). However, it is generally necessary to culture\nthe infective organism to arrive at a conclusive diagnosis and determine the susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.\nThus, it is essential to obtain a sample culture of the organism prior to initiating treatment. Otherwise, it is\nimpossible to differentiate whether a negative culture is due to the absence of organisms or is a result of\nantimicrobial effects of administered antibiotic. Definitive identification of the infecting organism may require other\nlaboratory techniques, such as detection of microbial antigens, DNA, or RNA, or an inflammatory or host immune\nresponse to the microorganism (Figure 28.1). Newer techniques such as rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and\nmatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry offer accurate, rapid,\nand cost-effective identification of the infecting organism(s).\n1003\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1004 ---\n\nFigure 28.1 Some laboratory techniques that are useful in the diagnosis of microbial\ndiseases.\n1004\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1005 ---\n\nB.  Empiric antimicrobial therapy\nIdeally, the antimicrobial agent used to treat an infection is selected after the organism has been identified and its\nsusceptibility to antimicrobial agents established. However, in the critically ill patient, such a delay could prove\nfatal, and immediate empiric therapy is indicated.\n1.  Timing\nAcutely ill patients with infections of unknown origin—for example, a neutropenic patient (one who is at risk for\ninfections due to a reduction in neutrophils) or a patient with meningitis (acute inflammation of the membranes\ncovering the brain and spinal cord)—require immediate treatment. If possible, therapy should be initiated after\nspecimens for laboratory analysis have been obtained but before the results of the culture and sensitivity are\navailable.\n2.  Selecting a drug\nDrug choice in the absence of susceptibility data is influenced by the site of infection, the patient history (for\nexample, previous infections, age, recent travel history, recent antimicrobial therapy, immune status, whether the\ninfection was hospital- or community-acquired), and local susceptibility data. Broad-spectrum therapy may be\nindicated initially when the organism is unknown or polymicrobial infections are likely. The choice of agent(s) may\nalso be guided by known association of particular organisms in a given clinical setting. For example, gram-positive\ncocci in the spinal fluid of a newborn is unlikely to be Streptococcus pneumoniae and most likely to be\nStreptococcus agalactiae  (a group B streptococci), which is sensitive to penicillin G. By contrast, gram-positive\ncocci in the spinal fluid of a 40-year-old patient are most likely to be S. pneumoniae . This organism is frequently\nresistant to penicillin G and often requires treatment with a high-dose third-generation cephalosporin (such as\nceftriaxone) or vancomycin.\n1005\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1006 ---\n\nC.  Determination of antimicrobial susceptibility\nAfter a pathogen is cultured, its susceptibility to specific antibiotics serves as a guide in selection of antimicrobial\ntherapy. Some pathogens, such as Streptococcus pyogenes  and Neisseria meningitidis , usually have predictable\nsusceptibility patterns to certain antibiotics. In contrast, most gram-negative bacilli, enterococci, and staphylococcal\nspecies often show unpredictable susceptibility patterns and require susceptibility testing to determine appropriate\nantimicrobial therapy. The minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations are used in determining\nsusceptibility of a drug and can be experimentally determined (Figure 28.2).\n1006\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1007 ---\n\n1007\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1008 ---\n\nFigure 28.2 Determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum\nbactericidal concentration (MBC) of an antibiotic.\n1.  Bacteriostatic versus bactericidal drugs\nAntimicrobial drugs are commonly classified as either bacteriostatic or bactericidal. Historically, bacteriostatic drugs\nwere thought to only arrest the growth and replication of bacteria at drug levels achievable in the patient, whereas\nbactericidal drugs were able to effectively kill ≥99.9% (3-log reduction) within 18 to 24 hours of incubation under\nspecific laboratory conditions. There is a growing consensus that this classification may be too simplistic, as most\nbacteriostatic agents are able to effectively kill organisms; however, they are unable to meet the arbitrary cutoff\nvalue in the bactericidal definition. Figure 28.3 shows a laboratory experiment in which a bactericidal agent is\ncompared to a bacteriostatic agent and a control. Note that the rate of in vitro killing is greater with bactericidal\nagents, but both agents are able to effectively kill the organism. It is also possible for an antibiotic to be\nbacteriostatic for one organism and bactericidal for another. For example, linezolid is bacteriostatic against\nStaphylococcus aureus and enterococci, but is bactericidal against most strains of S. pneumoniae . In addition, recent\ndata have demonstrated that bactericidal and bacteriostatic agents have similar efficacy for treating common clinical\ninfections. In the end, other factors may have a greater impact, including the host immune system, drug\nconcentration at the site of infection, and underlying severity of the illness.\nFigure 28.3 Effects of bactericidal and bacteriostatic drugs on the growth of bacteria in\nvitro.\n2.  Minimum inhibitory concentration\nThe minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is the lowest antimicrobial concentration that prevents visible growth\nof an organism after 24 hours of incubation. This serves as a quantitative measure of in vitro susceptibility and is\ncommonly used in practice to streamline therapy. Computer automation has improved the accuracy and decreased\nthe turnaround time for determining MIC results and is the most common approach used by clinical laboratories.\n1008\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1009 ---\n\n3.  Minimum bactericidal concentration:\nThe minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) is the lowest concentration of antimicrobial agent that results in a\n99.9% decline in colony count after overnight broth dilution incubations (Figure 28.2). [Note: The MBC is rarely\ndetermined in clinical practice due to the time and labor requirements.]\n1009\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1010 ---\n\nD.  Effect of the site of infection on therapy: the blood–brain\nbarrier\nAdequate levels of an antibiotic must reach the site of infection for the invading microorganisms to be effectively\neradicated. Capillaries with varying degrees of permeability carry drugs to the body tissues. Natural barriers to drug\ndelivery are created by the structures of the capillaries of some tissues, such as the prostate, testes, placenta, the\nvitreous body of the eye, and the central nervous system (CNS). Of particular significance are the capillaries in the\nbrain, which help to create and maintain the blood–brain barrier. This barrier is formed by the single layer of\nendothelial cells fused by tight junctions that impede entry from the blood to the brain of virtually all molecules,\nexcept those that are small and lipophilic. The penetration and concentration of an antibacterial agent in the CSF are\nparticularly influenced by the following:\n1010\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1011 ---\n\n1.  Lipid solubility\nThe lipid solubility of a drug is a major determinant of its ability to penetrate the blood–brain barrier. Lipid-soluble\ndrugs, such as chloramphenicol  and metronidazole, have significant penetration into the CNS, whereas β-lactam\nantibiotics, such as penicillin, are ionized at physiologic pH and have low lipid solubility. Therefore, they have\nlimited penetration through the intact blood–brain barrier under normal circumstances. In infections such as\nmeningitis in which the brain becomes inflamed, the barrier does not function as effectively, and local permeability\nis increased. Some β-lactam antibiotics can enter the CSF in therapeutic amounts when the meninges are inflamed.\n1011\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1012 ---\n\n2.  Molecular weight:\nA drug with a low molecular weight has an enhanced ability to cross the blood–brain barrier, whereas compounds\nwith a high molecular weight (for example, vancomycin) penetrate poorly, even in the presence of meningeal\ninflammation.\n1012\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1013 ---\n\n3.  Protein binding:\nA high degree of protein binding of a drug restricts its entry into the CSF. Therefore, the amount of free (unbound)\ndrug in serum, rather than the total amount of drug present, is important for CSF penetration.\n1013\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1014 ---\n\n4.  Susceptibility to transporters or efflux pumps:\nAntibiotics that have an affinity for transporter mechanisms or do not have an affinity for efflux pumps have better\nCNS penetration.\n1014\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1015 ---\n\nE.  Patient factors\nIn selecting an antibiotic, attention must be paid to the condition of the patient. For example, the status of the\nimmune system, kidneys, liver, circulation, and age must be considered. In women, pregnancy or breast-feeding also\naffects selection of the antimicrobial agent.\n1.  Immune system\nElimination of infecting organisms from the body is highly dependent on an intact immune system, and the host\ndefense system must ultimately eliminate the invading organisms. Alcoholism, diabetes, HIV infection,\nmalnutrition, autoimmune diseases, pregnancy, advanced age, and immunosuppressive drugs can affect\nimmunocompetence. High doses of bactericidal agents or longer courses of treatment may be required to eliminate\ninfective organisms in these individuals.\n2.  Renal dysfunction\nPoor kidney function may cause accumulation of certain antibiotics. Dosage adjustment prevents drug accumulation\nand adverse effects. Serum creatinine levels are frequently used as an index of renal function for adjustment of drug\nregimens. However, direct monitoring of serum levels of some antibiotics (for example, vancomycin,\naminoglycosides) is preferred to identify maximum and/or minimum values and prevent potential toxicities. [Note:\nThe number of functional nephrons decreases with age. Thus, elderly patients are particularly vulnerable to\naccumulation of drugs eliminated by the kidneys, even with normal serum creatinine levels.]\n3.  Hepatic dysfunction\nAntibiotics that are concentrated or eliminated by the liver (for example, erythromycin and doxycycline) must be\nused with caution when treating patients with liver dysfunction.\n4.  Poor perfusion\nDecreased circulation to an anatomic area, such as the lower limbs of a diabetic patient, reduces the amount of\nantibiotic that reaches that site of infection, making it more difficult to treat. Decreased perfusion of the\ngastrointestinal tract may result in reduced absorption, making attainment of therapeutic concentrations more\ndifficult with enteral routes.\n5.  Age\nRenal or hepatic elimination processes are often poorly developed in newborns, making neonates particularly\nvulnerable to the toxic effects of agents such as chloramphenicol  and sulfonamides. Young children should not be\ntreated with tetracyclines or quinolones, which affect bone growth and joints, respectively. Elderly patients may\nhave decreased renal or liver function, which may alter the pharmacokinetics of certain antibiotics.\n6.  Pregnancy and lactation\nMany antibiotics cross the placental barrier or enter the nursing infant via the breast milk. Prescribers should consult\nthe product labeling of an antibiotic to review the risk summary and clinical considerations for use in pregnancy and\nlactation. Although the concentration of an antibiotic in fetal circulation or in breast milk is usually low, the total\ndose to the infant may be sufficient to produce detrimental effects. For example, congenital abnormalities have been\nreported after administration of tetracyclines to pregnant women, and these agents should be generally be avoided in\npregnancy due to the risk to the fetus.\n7.  Risk factors for multidrug-resistant organisms\nInfections with multidrug-resistant pathogens need broader antibiotic coverage when initiating empiric therapy.\nCommon risk factors for infection with these pathogens include prior antimicrobial therapy in the preceding 90 days,\nhospitalization for greater than 2 days within the preceding 90 days, current hospitalization exceeding 5 days,\nadmission from a nursing home, high frequency of resistance in the community or local hospital unit (assessed using\nhospital antibiograms), and immunosuppressive diseases and/or therapies.\n1015\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1016 ---\n\nF.  Safety of the agent\nPenicillins are among the least toxic of all antimicrobial drugs because they interfere with a site or function unique\nto the growth of microorganisms. Other antimicrobial agents (for example, chloramphenicol ) have less specificity\nand are reserved for life-threatening infections because of the potential for serious toxicity to the patient. [Note:\nSafety is related not only to the inherent nature of the drug but also to the patient factors described above that can\npredispose to toxicity.]\n1016\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1017 ---\n\nG.  Cost of therapy\nIt is common for several drugs to show similar efficacy in treating an infection but vary widely in cost. For example,\ntreatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) generally includes one of the following:\nvancomycin, clindamycin, daptomycin, or linezolid. Although choice of therapy usually centers on the site of\ninfection, severity of the illness, and ability to take oral medications, it is also important to consider cost of the\nmedication. Figure 28.4 illustrates the relative cost of commonly used drugs for staphylococcal infections.\nFigure 28.4 Relative cost of some drugs used for the treatment of Staphylococcus aureus .\n1017\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1018 ---\n\nIII.  Route of Administration\nThe oral route of administration is appropriate for mild infections that can be treated on an outpatient basis.\nParenteral administration is used for drugs that are poorly absorbed from the GI tract and for treatment of patients\nwith serious infections who require maintenance of higher serum concentrations of antimicrobial agents. In\nhospitalized patients requiring intravenous (IV) therapy, the switch to oral agents should occur as soon as possible.\nSwitching patients from IV to oral therapy when clinically stable has been shown to decrease health care costs,\nshorten length of stay, and decrease complications from IV catheters. However, some antibiotics, such as\nvancomycin and aminoglycosides, are poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and do not achieve\nadequate serum levels via oral administration.\n1018\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1019 ---\n\nIV.  Determinants of Rational Dosing\nRational dosing of antimicrobial agents is based on pharmacodynamics (the relationship of drug concentrations to\nantimicrobial effects) and pharmacokinetic properties (the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of\nthe drug). Three important properties that have a significant influence on the frequency of dosing are concentration-\ndependent killing, time-dependent (concentration-independent) killing, and postantibiotic effect (PAE). Utilizing\nthese properties to optimize antibiotic dosing regimens can improve clinical outcomes and possibly decrease the\ndevelopment of resistance.\n1019\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1020 ---\n\nA.  Concentration-dependent killing\nCertain antimicrobial agents, including aminoglycosides and daptomycin, show a significant increase in the rate of\nbacterial killing as the concentration of antibiotic increases from 4- to 64-fold the MIC of the drug for the infecting\norganism (Figure 28.5A). Giving drugs that exhibit this concentration-dependent killing by a once-a-day bolus\ninfusion achieves high peak levels, favoring rapid killing of the infecting pathogen.\n1020\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1021 ---\n\n1021\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1022 ---\n\nFigure 28.5 A. Significant dose-dependent killing effect shown by tobramycin. B.\nNonsignificant dose-dependent killing effect shown by piperacillin. cfu = colony-forming\nunits; MIC = minimum inhibitory concentration.\n1022\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1023 ---\n\nB.  Time-dependent (concentration-independent) killing\nIn contrast, β-lactams, glycopeptides, macrolides, clindamycin, and linezolid do not exhibit concentration-dependent\nkilling (Figure 28.5B ). The clinical efficacy of these antimicrobials is best predicted by the percentage of time that\nblood concentrations of a drug remain above the MIC. This effect is sometimes called time-dependent (or\nconcentration-independent) killing. For example, dosing schedules for the penicillins and cephalosporins that ensure\nblood levels greater than the MIC for 50% and 60% of the time, respectively, provide the most clinical efficacy.\nTherefore, extended (generally 3 to 4 hours) or continuous (24 hours) infusions can be utilized instead of\nintermittent dosing (generally 30 minutes) to achieve prolonged time above the MIC and kill more bacteria. Other\ndrugs, such as fluoroquinolones and vancomycin, work best by optimizing the ratio of the 24-hour area under the\nconcentration–time curve to MIC (AUC24/MIC). The AUC24 is the overall exposure of a drug during the dosing\ninterval and takes into account the concentration as well as the time.\n1023\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1024 ---\n\nC.  Postantibiotic effect\nThe PAE is a persistent suppression of microbial growth that occurs after levels of antibiotic have fallen below the\nMIC. Antimicrobial drugs exhibiting a long PAE (for example, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones) often require\nonly one dose per day, particularly against gram-negative bacteria.\n1024\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1025 ---\n\nV.  Chemotherapeutic Spectra\nIn this book, the clinically important bacteria have been organized into eight groups based on Gram stain,\nmorphology, and biochemical or other characteristics. They are represented as a color-coded list (Figure 28.6A). The\nninth section of the list is labeled “Other,” and it is used to represent any organism not included in one of the other\neight categories. In Figure 28.6B–D, the list is used to illustrate the spectra of bacteria for which a particular class of\nantibiotics is therapeutically effective.\n1025\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1026 ---\n\n1026\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1027 ---\n\nFigure 28.6 A. Color-coded representation of medically important microorganisms. B.\nIsoniazid, narrow-spectrum antimicrobial agent. C. Ampicillin, an extended-spectrum\nantimicrobial agent. D. Tetracycline, a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent.\n1027\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1028 ---\n\nA.  Narrow-spectrum antibiotics\nChemotherapeutic agents acting only on a single or a limited group of microorganisms are said to have a narrow\nspectrum. For example, isoniazid is active only against Mycobacterium tuberculosis  (Figure 28.6B ).\n1028\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1029 ---\n\nB.  Extended-spectrum antibiotics\nExtended spectrum is the term applied to antibiotics that are modified to be effective against gram-positive\norganisms and also against a significant number of gram-negative bacteria. For example, ampicillin is considered to\nhave an extended spectrum because it acts against gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria (Figure 28.6C ).\n1029\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1030 ---\n\nC.  Broad-spectrum antibiotics\nDrugs such as tetracycline, fluoroquinolones and carbapenems affect a wide variety of microbial species and are\nreferred to as broad-spectrum antibiotics (Figure 28.6D). Administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics can\ndrastically alter the nature of the normal bacterial flora and precipitate a superinfection due to organisms such as\nClostridium difficile, the growth of which is normally kept in check by the presence of other colonizing\nmicroorganisms.\n1030\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1031 ---\n\nVI.  Combinations of Antimicrobial Drugs\nIt is therapeutically advisable to treat patients with a single agent that is most specific to the infecting organism. This\nstrategy reduces the possibility of superinfections, decreases the emergence of resistant organisms, and minimizes\ntoxicity. However, in some situations, combinations of antimicrobial drugs are advantageous or even required.\n1031\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1032 ---\n\nA.  Advantages of drug combinations\nCertain combinations of antibiotics, such as β-lactams and aminoglycosides, show synergism; that is, the\ncombination is more effective than either of the drugs used separately. Because such synergism among antimicrobial\nagents is rare, synergistic combinations are only indicated in special situations (for example, in the treatment of\nenterococcal endocarditis). Combinations may also be used when an infection is of unknown origin or when there\nare organisms with variable sensitivity, such as when treating tuberculosis.\n1032\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1033 ---\n\nB.  Disadvantages of drug combinations\nA number of antibiotics act only when organisms are multiplying. Thus, coadministration of an agent that causes\nbacteriostasis plus a second agent that is bactericidal may result in the first drug interfering with the action of the\nsecond. For example, bacteriostatic tetracycline drugs may interfere with the bactericidal effects of penicillins and\ncephalosporins. Another concern is the risk of selection pressure and the development of antibiotic resistance by\ngiving unnecessary combination therapy.\n1033\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1034 ---\n\nVII.  Drug Resistance\nBacteria are considered resistant to an antibiotic if the maximal level of that antibiotic that can be tolerated by the\nhost does not halt bacterial growth. Some organisms are inherently resistant to an antibiotic. For example, most\ngram-negative organisms are inherently resistant to vancomycin. However, microbial species that are normally\nresponsive to a particular drug may develop more virulent or resistant strains through spontaneous mutation or\nacquired resistance and selection. Some of these strains may even become resistant to more than one antibiotic.\n1034\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1035 ---\n\nA.  Genetic alterations leading to drug resistance\nAcquired antibiotic resistance requires the temporary or permanent gain or alteration of bacterial genetic\ninformation. Resistance develops due to the ability of DNA to undergo spontaneous mutation or to move from one\norganism to another (Figure 28.7).\nFigure 28.7 Some mechanisms of resistance to antibiotics.\n1035\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1036 ---\n\nB.  Altered expression of proteins in drug-resistant organisms\nDrug resistance is mediated by a variety of mechanisms, such as an alteration in an antibiotic target site, decreased\npenetration of the drug due to lower permeability, increased efflux of the drug, or presence of antibiotic-inactivating\nenzymes (Figure 28.7).\n1.  Modification of target sites\nAlteration of the target site of an antibiotic through mutation can confer resistance to one or more related antibiotics.\nFor example, S. pneumoniae resistance to β-lactam antibiotics involves alterations in one or more of the major\nbacterial penicillin-binding proteins, resulting in decreased binding of the antibiotic to its target.\n2.  Decreased accumulation\nDecreased uptake or increased efflux of an antibiotic can confer resistance because the drug is unable to attain\naccess to the site of its action in sufficient concentrations to injure or kill the organism. For example, gram-negative\norganisms can limit the penetration of certain agents, including β-lactam antibiotics, as a result of an alteration in the\nnumber and structure of porins (channels) in the outer membrane. Also, the presence of an efflux pump can limit\nlevels of a drug in an organism, as seen with tetracyclines.\n3.  Enzymatic inactivation\nThe ability to destroy or inactivate the antimicrobial agent can also confer resistance on microorganisms. Examples\nof antibiotic-inactivating enzymes include 1) β-lactamases (“penicillinases”) that hydrolytically inactivate the β-\nlactam ring of penicillins, cephalosporins, and related drugs; 2) acetyltransferases that transfer an acetyl group to the\nantibiotic, inactivating chloramphenicol  or aminoglycosides; and 3) esterases that hydrolyze the lactone ring of\nmacrolides.\n1036\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1037 ---\n\nVIII.  Prophylactic Use of Antibiotics\nCertain clinical situations, such as dental procedures and surgeries, require the use of antibiotics for the prevention\nrather than for the treatment of infections (Figure 28.8). Because the indiscriminate use of antimicrobial agents can\nresult in bacterial resistance and superinfection, prophylactic use is restricted to clinical situations in which the\nbenefits outweigh the potential risks. The duration of prophylaxis should be closely controlled to prevent the\nunnecessary development of antibiotic resistance.\n1037\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1038 ---\n\n1038\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1039 ---\n\nFigure 28.8 Some clinical situations in which prophylactic antibiotics are indicated.\n1039\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1040 ---\n\nIX.  Complications of Antibiotic Therapy\nEven though antibiotics are selectively toxic to an invading organism, the host may still experience adverse effects.\nFor example, the drug may produce an allergic response or may be toxic in ways unrelated to the antimicrobial\nactivity.\n1040\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1041 ---\n\nA.  Hypersensitivity\nHypersensitivity or immune reactions to antimicrobial drugs or their metabolic products frequently occur. For\nexample, the penicillins, despite their almost absolute selective microbial toxicity, can cause serious hypersensitivity\nproblems, ranging from urticaria (hives) to anaphylactic shock. Some reactions may be related to the rate of\ninfusion, such as “Red man syndrome” seen with rapid infusion of vancomycin. Patients with a documented history\nof Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis reaction (a severe sloughing of skin and mucus\nmembranes) to an antibiotic should never be rechallenged, not even for antibiotic desensitization.\n1041\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1042 ---\n\nB.  Direct toxicity\nHigh serum levels of certain antibiotics may cause toxicity by directly affecting cellular processes in the host. For\nexample, aminoglycosides can cause ototoxicity by interfering with membrane function in the auditory hair cells.\nChloramphenicol  can have a direct toxic effect on mitochondria, leading to bone marrow suppression.\nFluoroquinolones can have effects on cartilage and tendons, and tetracyclines have direct effects on bones. A\nnumber of antibiotics can cause photosensitivity.\n1042\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1043 ---\n\nC.  Superinfections\nDrug therapy, particularly with broad-spectrum antimicrobials or combinations of agents, can lead to alterations of\nthe normal microbial flora of the upper respiratory, oral, intestinal, and genitourinary tracts, permitting the\novergrowth of opportunistic organisms, especially fungi or resistant bacteria. These infections usually require\nsecondary treatments using specific anti-infective agents.\n1043\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1044 ---\n\nX.  Sites of Antimicrobial Action\nAntimicrobial drugs can be classified in a number of ways: 1) by their chemical structure (for example, β-lactams or\naminoglycosides), 2) by their mechanism of action (for example, cell wall synthesis inhibitors), or 3) by their\nactivity against particular types of organisms (for example, bacteria, fungi, or viruses). Chapters 29 through 31 are\norganized by the mechanisms of action of the drug (Figure 28.9), and Chapters 32 through 34 are organized\naccording to the type of organisms affected by the drug.\nFigure 28.9 Classification of some antimicrobial agents by their sites of action.

Although the minimum inhibitory concentration impacts the effectiveness of the drug against\na given bacteria, it does not affect the ability of a drug to penetrate into the brain. Lipid solubility, protein\nbinding, and molecular weight all determine the likelihood of a drug to penetrate the blood–brain barrier and\nconcentrate in the brain.\nA 72-year-old male presents with fever, cough, malaise, and shortness of breath. His chest x-ray shows\nbilateral infiltrates consistent with pneumonia. Bronchial wash cultures reveal Pseudomonas aeruginosasensitive to cefepime. Which of the following is the best dosing scheme for cefepime based on the drug's\ntime-dependent bactericidal activity?\nA.  1 g every 6 hours given over 30 minutes\nB.  2 g every 12 hours given over 3 hours\nC.  4 g every 24 hours given over 30 minutes\nD.  4 g given as continuous infusion over 24 hours\nCorrect answer = D. The clinical efficacy of cefepime is based on the percentage of time that the drug\nconcentration remains above the MIC. A continuous infusion would allow for the greatest amount of time above\nthe MIC compared to intermittent (30 minutes) and prolonged infusions (3 to 4 hours).\nWhich of the following adverse drug reactions precludes a patient from being rechallenged with that drug in\nthe future?\nA.  Itching/rash from penicillin\nB.  Stevens-Johnson syndrome from sulfamethoxazole–trimethoprim\nC.  Gastrointestinal (GI) upset from clarithromycin\nD.  Clostridium difficile superinfection from moxifloxacin\nCorrect answer = B. Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a severe idiosyncratic reaction that can be life threatening, and\nthese patients should never be rechallenged with the offending agent. Itching/rash is a commonly reported\nreaction in patients receiving penicillins but is not life threatening. A patient may be rechallenged if the benefits\noutweigh the risk (for example, pregnant patient with syphilis) or the patient could be exposed through a\ndesensitization procedure. GI upset is a common side effect of clarithromycin but is not due to an allergic\nreaction. Moxifloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that can inhibit the normal flora of the GI tract, increasing\nthe risk for the development of superinfections like C. difficile. This is not an allergic reaction, and the patient can\nbe rechallenged; however, the patient might be at risk for developing C. difficile  infection again.\n1046\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1047 ---\n\n29\nCell Wall Inhibitors\nVeena Venugopalan and Kenneth P. Klinker\n1047\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1048 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nSome antimicrobial drugs selectively interfere with synthesis of the bacterial cell wall—a structure that mammalian\ncells do not possess. The cell wall is composed of a polymer called peptidoglycan that consists of glycan units\njoined to each other by peptide cross-links. To be maximally effective, inhibitors of cell wall synthesis require\nactively proliferating microorganisms. Figure 29.1 shows the classification of agents affecting cell wall synthesis.\n1048\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1049 ---\n\n1049\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1050 ---\n\nFigure 29.1 Summary of antimicrobial agents affecting cell wall synthesis. (Figure\ncontinues on next page.) *Only available in oral formulation. **Available in oral and\nintravenous formulations.\n1050\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1051 ---\n\nII.  Penicillins\nThe basic structure of penicillins consists of a core four-membered β-lactam ring, which is attached to a thiazolidine\nring and an R side chain. Members of this family differ from one another in the R substituent attached to the 6-\naminopenicillanic acid residue (Figure 29.2). The nature of this side chain affects the antimicrobial spectrum,\nstability to stomach acid, cross-hypersensitivity, and susceptibility to bacterial degradative enzymes (β-lactamases).\nFigure 29.2 Structure of β-lactam antibiotics.\n1051\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1052 ---\n\nA.  Mechanism of action\nPenicillins interfere with the last step of bacterial cell wall synthesis, which is the cross-linking of adjacent\npeptidoglycan strands by a process known as transpeptidation. Since penicillins structurally resemble the terminal\nportion of the peptidoglycan strand, they compete for and bind to enzymes called penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs),\nwhich catalyze transpeptidase and facilitate cross-linking of the cell wall (Figure 29.3). The result is the formation of\na weakened cell wall and ultimately cell death. For this reason, penicillins are regarded as bactericidal and work in a\ntime-dependent fashion.\nFigure 29.3 Bacterial cell wall of gram-positive bacteria. NAM = N-acetylmuramic acid;\nNAG = N -acetylglucosamine; PEP = cross-linking peptide.\n1052\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1053 ---\n\nB.  Antibacterial spectrum\nThe antibacterial spectrum of the various penicillins is determined, in part, by their ability to cross the bacterial\npeptidoglycan cell wall to reach the PBPs in the periplasmic space. Factors determining PBP susceptibility to these\nantibiotics include size, charge, and hydrophobicity of the particular β-lactam antibiotic. In general, gram-positive\nmicroorganisms have cell walls that are easily traversed by penicillins, and, therefore, in the absence of resistance,\nthey are susceptible to these drugs. Gram-negative microorganisms have an outer lipopolysaccharide membrane\nsurrounding the cell wall that presents a barrier to the water-soluble penicillins. However, gram-negative bacteria\nhave proteins inserted in the lipopolysaccharide layer that act as water-filled channels (called porins) to permit\ntransmembrane entry.\n1.  Natural penicillins\nPenicillin G and penicillin V  are obtained from fermentations of the fungus Penicillium chrysogenum. Penicillin\n[pen-i-SILL-in] G (benzylpenicillin) has activity against a variety of gram-positive organisms, gram-negative\norganisms, and spirochetes (Figure 29.4). The potency of penicillin G is five to ten times greater than that of\npenicillin V  against both Neisseria  spp. and certain anaerobes. Most streptococci are very sensitive to penicillin G,\nbut penicillin-resistant viridans streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae  isolates are emerging. The vast majority\nof Staphylococcus aureus  (greater than 90%) are now penicillinase producing and therefore resistant to penicillin G.\nDespite widespread use and increasing resistance in many types of bacteria, penicillin remains the drug of choice for\nthe treatment of gas gangrene (Clostridium perfringens ) and syphilis (Treponema pallidum ). Penicillin V , only\navailable in oral formulation, has a spectrum similar to that of penicillin G, but it is not used for treatment of severe\ninfections because of its limited oral absorption. Penicillin V  is more acid stable than is penicillin G and is the oral\nagent employed in the treatment of less severe infections.\nFigure 29.4 Typical therapeutic applications of penicillin G. *Resistant strains are\nincreasingly seen.\n2.  Semisynthetic penicillins\nAmpicillin [am-pi-SILL-in] and amoxicillin [a-mox-i-SILL-in] (also known as aminopenicillins or extended-\nspectrum penicillins) are created by chemically attaching different R groups to the 6-aminopenicillanic acid nucleus.\nAddition of R groups extends the gram-negative antimicrobial activity of aminopenicillins to include Haemophilus\ninfluenzae , Escherichia coli,  and Proteus mirabilis  (Figure 29.5A). Ampicillin (with or without the addition of\ngentamicin) is the drug of choice for the gram-positive bacillus Listeria monocytogenes  and susceptible enterococcal\nspecies. These extended-spectrum agents are also widely used in the treatment of respiratory infections, and\namoxicillin is employed prophylactically by dentists in high-risk patients for the prevention of bacterial endocarditis.\nThese drugs are coformulated with β-lactamase inhibitors, such as clavulanic acid or sulbactam, to combat\ninfections caused by β-lactamase–producing organisms. For example, without the β-lactamase inhibitor, methicillin-\nsensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) is resistant to ampicillin and amoxicillin. Resistance in the form of\nplasmid-mediated penicillinases is a major clinical problem, which limits use of aminopenicillins with some gram-\nnegative organisms.\n1053\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1054 ---\n\nFigure 29.5 Antimicrobial activity of ampicillin (A) and piperacillin (B).\n3.  Antistaphylococcal penicillins\nMethicillin [meth-i-SILL-in], nafcillin [naf-SILL-in], oxacillin [ox-a-SILL-in], and dicloxacillin [dye-klox-a-SILL-\nin] are β-lactamase (penicillinase)-resistant penicillins. Their use is restricted to the treatment of infections caused\nby penicillinase-producing staphylococci, including MSSA. [Note: Because of its toxicity (interstitial nephritis),\nmethicillin is not used clinically in the United States except in laboratory tests to identify resistant strains of\nStaphylococcus aureus. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) is currently a source of serious\ncommunity and nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infections and is resistant to most commercially available β-lactam\nantibiotics.] The penicillinase-resistant penicillins have minimal to no activity against gram-negative infections.\n1054\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1055 ---\n\n4.  Antipseudomonal penicillin\nPiperacillin [pip-er-a-SILL-in] is also referred to as an antipseudomonal penicillin because of its activity against\nPseudomonas aeruginosa  (Figure 29.5B ). Formulation of piperacillin with tazobactam extends the antimicrobial\nspectrum to include penicillinase-producing organisms (for example, most Enterobacteriaceae and Bacteroides\nspecies). Figure 29.6 summarizes the stability of the penicillins to acid or the action of penicillinase.\n1055\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1056 ---\n\n1056\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1057 ---\n\nFigure 29.6 Stability of the penicillins to acid or the action of penicillinase. *Available\nonly as parenteral preparation.\n1057\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1058 ---\n\nC.  Resistance\nSurvival of bacteria in the presence of β-lactam antibiotics occurs due to the following:\n1.  β-Lactamase production\nThis family of enzymes hydrolyzes the cyclic amide bond of the β-lactam ring, which results in loss of bactericidal\nactivity (Figure 29.2). They are the major cause of resistance to the penicillins and are an increasing problem. β-\nLactamases either are constitutive, mostly produced by the bacterial chromosome or, more commonly, are acquired\nby the transfer of plasmids. Some of the β-lactam antibiotics are poor substrates for β-lactamases and resist\nhydrolysis, thus retaining their activity against β-lactamase–producing organisms. [Note: Certain organisms may\nhave chromosome-associated β-lactamases that are inducible by β-lactam antibiotics (for example, second- and\nthird-generation cephalosporins).] Gram-positive organisms secrete β-lactamases extracellularly, whereas gram-\nnegative bacteria inactivate β-lactam drugs in the periplasmic space.\n2.  Decreased permeability to the drug\nDecreased penetration of the antibiotic through the outer cell membrane of the bacteria prevents the drug from\nreaching the target PBPs. In gram-positive bacteria, the peptidoglycan layer is near the surface of the bacteria and\nthere are few barriers for the drug to reach its target. Reduced penetration of drug into the cell is a greater concern in\ngram-negative organisms, which have a complex cell wall that includes aqueous channels called porins. An\nexcellent example of a pathogen lacking high permeability porins is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The presence of an\nefflux pump, which actively removes antibiotics from the site of action, can also reduce the amount of intracellular\ndrug (for example, Klebsiella pneumoniae).\n3.  Altered PBPs\nThese are bacterial enzymes involved in the synthesis of the cell wall and in the maintenance of morphologic\nfeatures of the bacterium. Antibiotic exposure can prevent cell wall synthesis and can lead to morphologic changes\nor lysis of susceptible bacteria. The number of PBPs varies with the type of organism. Modified PBPs have a lower\naffinity for β-lactam antibiotics, requiring clinically unattainable concentrations of the drug to effect inhibition of\nbacterial growth. This explains MRSA resistance to most commercially available β-lactams.\n1058\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1059 ---\n\nD.  Pharmacokinetics\n1.  Administration\nThe route of administration of a β-lactam antibiotic is determined by the stability of the drug to gastric acid and by\nthe severity of the infection.\n2.  Routes of administration\nThe combination of ampicillin with sulbactam, piperacillin with tazobactam, and the antistaphylococcal penicillins\nnafcillin and oxacillin must be administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM). Penicillin V , amoxicillin,\nand dicloxacillin are available only as oral preparations. Others are effective by the oral, IV, or IM routes ( Figure\n29.6). [Note: The combination of amoxicillin with clavulanic acid is only available in an oral formulation in the\nUnited States.]\n3.  Depot forms\nProcaine penicillin G and benzathine penicillin G are administered IM and serve as depot forms. They are slowly\nabsorbed into the circulation and persist at low levels over a long time period.\n4.  Absorption\nThe acidic environment within the intestinal tract is unfavorable for the absorption of penicillins. In the case of\npenicillin V , only one-third of an oral dose is absorbed under the best of conditions. Food decreases the absorption of\nthe penicillinase-resistant penicillin dicloxacillin because as gastric emptying time increases, the drug is destroyed\nby stomach acid. Therefore, it should be taken on an empty stomach. Conversely, amoxicillin is stable in acid and is\nreadily absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.\n5.  Distribution\nThe β-lactam antibiotics distribute well throughout the body. All the penicillins cross the placental barrier, but none\nhave been shown to have teratogenic effects. However, penetration into bone or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is\ninsufficient for therapy unless these sites are inflamed (Figures 29.7 and 29.8). [Note: Inflamed meninges are more\npermeable to the penicillins, resulting in an increased ratio of the drug in the CSF compared to the serum.] Penicillin\nlevels in the prostate are insufficient to be effective against infections.\nFigure 29.7 Administration and fate of penicillin. CNS = central nervous system.\n1059\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1060 ---\n\nFigure 29.8 Enhanced penetration of penicillin into the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) during\ninflammation.\n6.  Metabolism\nHost metabolism of the β-lactam antibiotics is usually insignificant, but some metabolism of penicillin G may occur\nin patients with impaired renal function. Nafcillin and oxacillin are exceptions to the rule and are primarily\nmetabolized in the liver.\n7.  Excretion\nThe primary route of excretion is through the organic acid (tubular) secretory system of the kidney as well as by\nglomerular filtration. Patients with impaired renal function must have dosage regimens adjusted. Because nafcillin\nand oxacillin are primarily metabolized in the liver, they do not require dose adjustment for renal insufficiency.\nProbenecid inhibits the secretion of penicillins by competing for active tubular secretion via the organic acid\ntransporter and, thus, can increase blood levels. The penicillins are also excreted in breast milk.\n1060\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1061 ---\n\nE.  Adverse reactions\nPenicillins are among the safest drugs. However, adverse reactions may occur (Figure 29.9).\n1061\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1062 ---\n\nFigure 29.9 Summary of the adverse effects of penicillins.\n1062\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1063 ---\n\n1.  Hypersensitivity\nApproximately 10% of patients self-report allergy to penicillin. Reactions range from rashes to angioedema (marked\nswelling of the lips, tongue, and periorbital area) and anaphylaxis. Cross-allergic reactions occur among the β-\nlactam antibiotics. To determine whether treatment with a β-lactam is safe when an allergy is noted, patient history\nregarding severity of previous reaction is essential.\n2.  Diarrhea\nDiarrhea is a common problem that is caused by a disruption of the normal balance of intestinal microorganisms. It\noccurs to a greater extent with those agents that are incompletely absorbed and have an extended antibacterial\nspectrum. Pseudomembranous colitis from Clostridium difficile and other organisms may occur with penicillin use.\n3.  Nephritis\nPenicillins, particularly methicillin, have the potential to cause acute interstitial nephritis. [Note: Methicillin is\ntherefore no longer used clinically.]\n4.  Neurotoxicity\nThe penicillins are irritating to neuronal tissue, and they can provoke seizures if injected intrathecally or if very high\nblood levels are reached. Epileptic patients are particularly at risk due to the ability of penicillins to cause\nGABAergic inhibition.\n5.  Hematologic toxicities\nDecreased coagulation may be observed with high doses of piperacillin and nafcillin (and, to some extent, with\npenicillin G). Cytopenias have been associated with therapy of greater than 2 weeks, and therefore, blood counts\nshould be monitored weekly for such patients.\n1063\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1064 ---\n\nIII.  Cephalosporins\nThe cephalosporins are β-lactam antibiotics closely related both structurally and functionally to penicillins. Most\ncephalosporins are produced semisynthetically by the chemical attachment of side chains to 7-aminocephalosporanic\nacid. Structural changes on the acyl side chain at the 7-position alter antibacterial activity and variations at the 3-\nposition modify the pharmacokinetic profile ( Figure 29.10). Cephalosporins have the same mode of action as\npenicillins, and they are affected by the same resistance mechanisms. However, they tend to be more resistant than\nthe penicillins to certain β-lactamases.\nFigure 29.10 Structural features of cephalosporin antibiotics.\n1064\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1065 ---\n\nA.  Antibacterial spectrum\nCephalosporins have been classified as first, second, third, fourth, and advanced generation, based largely on their\nbacterial susceptibility patterns and resistance to β-lactamases (Figure 29.11). [Note: Commercially available\ncephalosporins are ineffective against L. monocytogenes, C. difficile , and the enterococci.]\n1065\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1066 ---\n\n1066\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1067 ---\n\nFigure 29.11 Summary of therapeutic applications of cephalosporins. *Methicillin-\nresistant staphylococci are resistant. **Cefoxitin and cefotetan have anaerobic coverage.\n†Ceftazidime only.\n1.  First generation\nThe first-generation cephalosporins act as penicillin G substitutes. They are resistant to the staphylococcal\npenicillinase (that is, they cover MSSA). Isolates of S . pneumoniae  resistant to penicillin are also resistant to first-\ngeneration cephalosporins. Agents in this generation also have modest activity against Proteus mirabilis , E. coli , and\nK. pneumoniae . Most oral cavity anaerobes like Peptostreptococcu s are sensitive, but the Bacteroides fragilis  group\nis resistant.\n2.  Second generation\nThe second-generation cephalosporins display greater activity against gram-negative organisms, such as H .\ninfluenzae , Klebsiella  species, Proteus  species, Escherichia coli , and Moraxella catarrhalis , whereas activity against\ngram-positive organisms is weaker. Antimicrobial coverage of the cephamycins (cefotetan [sef-oh-TEE-tan] and\ncefoxitin [sef-OX-i-tin]) also includes anaerobes (for example, Bacteroides fragilis ). They are the only\ncephalosporins commercially available with appreciable activity against gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. However,\nneither drug is first line because of the increasing prevalence of resistance among B. fragilis .\n3.  Third generation\nThese cephalosporins have assumed an important role in the treatment of infectious diseases. Although they are less\npotent than first-generation cephalosporins against MSSA, the third-generation cephalosporins have enhanced\nactivity against gram-negative bacilli, including β-lactamase producing strains of H. influenzae  and Neisseria\ngonorrhoeae . The spectrum of activity of this class includes enteric organisms, such as Serratia marcescens  and\nProvidencia  species. Ceftriaxone [sef-trye-AKS-own] and cefotaxime [sef-oh-TAKS-eem] have become agents of\nchoice in the treatment of meningitis. Ceftazidime [sef-TA-zi-deem] has activity against P. aeruginosa ; however,\nresistance is increasing and use should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Third-generation cephalosporins must\nbe used with caution, as they are associated with significant “collateral damage,” including the induction of\nantimicrobial resistance and development of Clostridium difficile infection. [Note: Fluoroquinolone use is also\nassociated with collateral damage.]\n4.  Fourth generation\nCefepime [SEF-eh-peem] is classified as a fourth-generation cephalosporin and must be administered parenterally.\nCefepime has a wide antibacterial spectrum, with activity against streptococci and staphylococci (but only those that\nare methicillin susceptible). Cefepime is also effective against aerobic gram-negative organisms, such as\nEnterobacter species, E . coli, K . pneumoniae, P . mirabilis , and P . aeruginosa . When selecting an antibiotic that is\nactive against P . aeruginosa , clinicians should refer to their local antibiograms (laboratory testing for the sensitivity\nof an isolated bacterial strain to different antibiotics) for direction.\n5.  Advanced generation\nCeftaroline [sef-TAR-oh-leen] is a broad-spectrum, advanced-generation cephalosporin. It is the only β-lactam in\nthe United States with activity against MRSA, and it is indicated for the treatment of complicated skin and skin\nstructure infections and community-acquired pneumonia. The unique structure allows ceftaroline to bind to PBPs\nfound in MRSA and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. In addition to its broad gram-positive activity, it\nalso has similar gram-negative activity to the third-generation cephalosporin ceftriaxone. Important gaps in coverage\ninclude P . aeruginosa , extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, and Acinetobacter\nbaumannii . The twice-daily dosing regimen also limits use outside of an institutional setting.\n1067\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1068 ---\n\nB.  Resistance\nResistance to the cephalosporins is either due to the hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring by β-lactamases or reduced\naffinity for PBPs.\n1068\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1069 ---\n\nC.  Pharmacokinetics\n1.  Administration\nMany of the cephalosporins must be administered IV or IM (Figure 29.12) because of their poor oral absorption.\nExceptions are noted in Figure 29.13.\nFigure 29.12 Administration and fate of the cephalosporins. CSF = cerebrospinal fluid.\n1069\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1070 ---\n\nFigure 29.13 Therapeutic advantages of some clinically useful cephalosporins. [Note:\nDrugs that can be administered orally are shown in reverse type. More useful drugs\nshown in bold.]. CSF = cerebrospinal fluid; MRSA = methicillin-resistant Staphylococcusaureus .\n2.  Distribution\nAll cephalosporins distribute very well into body fluids. However, adequate therapeutic levels in the CSF, regardless\nof inflammation, are achieved with only a few cephalosporins. For example, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime are effective\nin the treatment of neonatal and childhood meningitis caused by H. influenzae . Cefazolin [se-FA-zo-lin] is\ncommonly used for surgical prophylaxis due to its activity against penicillinase-producing S . aureus , along with its\ngood tissue and fluid penetration.\n3.  Elimination\nCephalosporins are eliminated through tubular secretion and/or glomerular filtration ( Figure 29.12). Therefore,\ndoses must be adjusted in renal dysfunction to guard against accumulation and toxicity. One exception is\nceftriaxone, which is excreted through the bile into the feces and, therefore, is frequently employed in patients with\nrenal insufficiency.\n1070\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1071 ---\n\nD.  Adverse effects\nLike the penicillins, the cephalosporins are generally well tolerated. However, allergic reactions are a concern.\nPatients who have had an anaphylactic response, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal necrolysis to\npenicillins should not receive cephalosporins. Cephalosporins should be avoided or used with caution in individuals\nwith penicillin allergy. Current data suggest that the cross-reactivity between penicillin and cephalosporins is around\n3% to 5% and is determined by the similarity in the side chain, not the β-lactam structure. The highest rate of\nallergic cross-sensitivity is between penicillin and first-generation cephalosporins.\n1071\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1072 ---\n\nIV.  Other β-Lactam Antibiotics\n1072\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1073 ---\n\nA.  Carbapenems\nCarbapenems are synthetic β-lactam antibiotics that differ in structure from the penicillins in that the sulfur atom of\nthe thiazolidine ring (Figure 29.2) has been externalized and replaced by a carbon atom ( Figure 29.14). Imipenem [i-\nmi-PEN-em], meropenem [mer-oh-PEN-em], doripenem [dore-i-PEN-em], and ertapenem [er-ta-PEN-em] are drugs\nin this group.\nFigure 29.14 Structural features of imipenem and aztreonam.\n1.  Antibacterial spectrum\nImipenem resists hydrolysis by most β-lactamases, but not the metallo-β-lactamases. This drug plays a role in\nempiric therapy because it is active against β-lactamase–producing gram-positive and gram-negative organisms,\nanaerobes, and P. aeruginosa  (Figure 29.15). Meropenem and doripenem have antibacterial activity similar to that of\nimipenem. Doripenem may retain activity against resistant isolates of Pseudomonas . Unlike other carbapenems,\nertapenem lacks coverage against P . aeruginosa, Enterococcus  species, and Acinetobacter  species.\n1073\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1074 ---\n\nFigure 29.15 Antimicrobial spectrum of imipenem. *Methicillin-resistant staphylococci\nare resistant. **Includes penicillinase-producing strains.\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\n1074\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1075 ---\n\nImipenem, meropenem, and doripenem are administered IV and penetrate well into body tissues and fluids,\nincluding the CSF when the meninges are inflamed. Meropenem is known to reach therapeutic levels in bacterial\nmeningitis even without inflammation. These agents are excreted by glomerular filtration. Imipenem undergoes\ncleavage by a dehydropeptidase found in the brush border of the proximal renal tubule. Compounding imipenem\nwith cilastatin protects the parent drug from renal dehydropeptidase and, thus, prolongs its activity in the body. The\nother carbapenems do not require coadministration of cilastatin. Ertapenem is administered IV once daily. [Note:\nDoses of these agents must be adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency.]\n3.  Adverse effects\nImipenem/ cilastatin can cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Eosinophilia and neutropenia are less common than\nwith other β-lactams. High levels of imipenem may provoke seizures; however, the other carbapenems are less likely\nto do so. Carbapenems and penicillin share a common bicyclic core. Structural similarity may confer cross-reactivity\nbetween classes. While those with true penicillin allergy should use carbapenems cautiously, the cross-reactivity rate\nseen in studies is very low (less than 1%).\n1075\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1076 ---\n\nB.  Monobactams\nThe monobactams, which also disrupt bacterial cell wall synthesis, are unique because the β-lactam ring is not fused\nto another ring ( Figure 29.14). Aztreonam [az-TREE-oh-nam], which is the only commercially available\nmonobactam, has antimicrobial activity directed primarily against gram-negative pathogens, including the\nEnterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa . It lacks activity against gram-positive organisms and anaerobes. Aztreonam is\nadministered either IV or IM and can accumulate in patients with renal failure. Aztreonam is relatively nontoxic, but\nit may cause phlebitis, skin rash, and, occasionally, abnormal liver function tests. This drug has a low immunogenic\npotential, and it shows little cross-reactivity with antibodies induced by other β-lactams. Thus, this drug may offer a\nsafe alternative for treating patients who are allergic to other penicillins, cephalosporins, or carbapenems.\n1076\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1077 ---\n\nV.  β-Lactamase Inhibitors\nHydrolysis of the β-lactam ring, either by enzymatic cleavage with a β-lactamase or by acid, destroys the\nantimicrobial activity of a β-lactam antibiotic. β-Lactamase inhibitors, such as clavulanic [cla-vue-LAN-ick] acid,\nsulbactam [sul-BACK-tam], and tazobactam [ta-zoh-BACK-tam], contain a β-lactam ring but, by themselves, do not\nhave significant antibacterial activity or cause any significant adverse effects. Avibactam [av-ee-BACK-tam] and\nvaborbactam [vay-bor-BACK-tam] are also β-lactamase inhibitors; however, their structures lack the core β-lactam\nring. β-Lactamase inhibitors function by inactivating β-lactamases, thereby protecting the antibiotics that are\nnormally substrates for these enzymes. The β-lactamase inhibitors are, therefore, formulated in combination with β-\nlactamase–sensitive antibiotics, such as amoxicillin, ampicillin, and piperacillin (Figure 29.1). Figure 29.16 shows\nthe effect of clavulanic acid and amoxicillin on the growth of β-lactamase–producing E. coli . [Note: Clavulanic acid\nis nearly devoid of any antibacterial activity.]\nFigure 29.16 The in vitro growth of Escherichia coli  in the presence of amoxicillin, with\nand without clavulanic acid.\n1077\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1078 ---\n\nA.  Cephalosporin and β-lactamase inhibitor combinations\nCeftolozane [sef-TOL-oh-zane] is a third-generation cephalosporin combined with the β-lactamase inhibitor,\ntazobactam. Ceftolozane-tazobactam is available only in an IV formulation. Its niche for use is in the treatment of\nresistant Enterobacteriaceae and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Ceftolozane-tazobactam has activity\nagainst some β-lactamase–producing bacteria (for example, select strains of ESBLs). This combination has narrow\ngram-positive and very limited anaerobic activity. Ceftazidime, a third-generation cephalosporin is combined with\nthe β-lactamase inhibitor avibactam [AV-i-BAK-tam]. Ceftazidime-avibactam, available only in IV formulation, has\nbroad gram-negative activity including Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa . Addition of avibactam allows the drug\nto resist hydrolysis against broad spectrum β-lactamases (AmpC, ESBL, carbapenemases) with the exception of\nmetallo-β-lactamases. Ceftazidime-avibactam has minimal activity against Acinetobacter as well as anaerobic and\ngram-positive organisms. Both of these combinations are indicated for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections\n(in combination with metronidazole) and for the management of complicated urinary tract infections. Given the\nextensive antimicrobial activity, ceftolozane–tazobactam and ceftazidime–avibactam are reserved for the treatment\nof infections due to multidrug-resistant pathogens.\n1078\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1079 ---\n\nB.  Carbapenem/β-lactamase inhibitor combination\nMeropenem-vaborbactam is a combination of a carbapenem and a β-lactamase inhibitor. It is approved for the\ntreatment of complicated urinary tract infections including pyelonephritis. This combination agent has activity\nagainst Enterobacteriaceae producing a broad spectrum of β-lactamases, except metallo-β-lactamases.\n1079\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1080 ---\n\nVI.  Vancomycin\nVancomycin [van-koe-MYE-sin] is a tricyclic glycopeptide active against aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive\nbacteria, including MRSA, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis  (MRSE), Enterococcus  spp., and\nClostridium difficile  (Figure 29.17). Following cell entry, it binds to peptidoglycan precursors, disrupting\npolymerization and cross-linking required for maintenance of cell wall integrity. This interaction results in\nbactericidal activity. Due to an increase in MRSA, vancomycin is commonly used in patients with skin and soft\ntissue infections, infective endocarditis, and nosocomial pneumonia. Frequency of administration is dependent on\nrenal function. Therefore, monitoring of creatinine clearance is required to optimize exposure and minimize toxicity.\nOptimal cure rates are observed when trough concentrations are maintained between 10 and 20 mcg/mL. [Note: The\narea under the curve/minimum inhibitory concentration ratio (AUC/MIC) is the best predictor of vancomycin\nactivity against S. aureus , with an AUC/MIC of greater than or equal to 400 associated with treatment success.]\nInitial trough concentrations are attained prior to the fourth or fifth vancomycin dose to ensure appropriate dosing.\nCommon adverse events include nephrotoxicity, infusion-related reactions (red man syndrome and phlebitis), and\nototoxicity. Emergence of resistance is uncommon within Streptococcus and Staphylococcus  spp., but frequently\nobserved in Enterococcus faecium  infections. Resistance is driven by alterations in binding affinity to peptidoglycan\nprecursors. Due to the prevalence of resistance, prudent use of vancomycin is warranted. Lastly, vancomycin has\npoor absorption after oral administration, so use of the oral formulation is limited to the management of Clostridium\ndifficile  infection in the colon.\nFigure 29.17 Antimicrobial spectrum of vancomycin. *Includes methicillin-resistant\nstrains. **Oral vancomycin only for C. difficile .\n1080\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1081 ---\n\nVII.  Lipoglycopeptides\nTelavancin [tel-a-VAN-sin], oritavancin [or-IT-a-VAN-sin], and dalbavancin [dal-ba-VAN-sin] are bactericidal\nconcentration-dependent semisynthetic lipoglycopeptide antibiotics with activity against gram-positive bacteria. The\nlipoglycopeptides maintain a spectrum of activity similar to vancomycin, affecting primarily staphylococci,\nstreptococci, and enterococci. Because of structural differences, they are more potent than vancomycin and may have\nactivity against vancomycin-resistant isolates. Like vancomycin, these agents inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis.\nThe lipid tail is essential in anchoring the drug to the cell walls to improve target site binding. Additionally,\ntelavancin and oritavancin disrupt membrane potential. In combination, these actions improve activity and minimize\nselection of resistance. Telavancin is considered an alternative to vancomycin in treating acute bacterial skin and\nskin structure infections (ABSSSIs) and hospital-acquired pneumonia caused by resistant gram-positive organisms,\nincluding MRSA. The use of telavancin in clinical practice may be limited by its adverse effect profile, which\nincludes nephrotoxicity, risk of fetal harm, and interactions with medications known to prolong the QTc interval (for\nexample, fluoroquinolones, macrolides). Prior to initiation, assessment of renal function, pregnancy status, and\ncurrent medications is needed to ensure safe administration.\nIn contrast to telavancin, oritavancin and dalbavancin have prolonged half-lives (245 and 187 hours,\nrespectively), allowing for single-dose administration for the management of ABSSSI. Stable patients with ABSSSI\nmay be treated as outpatients, eliminating the need for inpatient admission, central catheter placement, and/or daily\noutpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy. Consistent with other glycopeptides, infusion-related reactions may occur.\nOritavancin and telavancin are known to interfere with phospholipid reagents used in assessing coagulation.\nAlternative therapy should be considered with concomitant heparin use.\n1081\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1082 ---\n\nVIII.  Daptomycin\nDaptomycin [DAP-toe-mye-sin] is a bactericidal concentration-dependent cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic that is an\nalternative to other agents, such as vancomycin or linezolid, for treating infections caused by resistant gram-positive\norganisms, including MRSA and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) (Figure 29.18). Daptomycin is indicated\nfor the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections and bacteremia caused by S . aureus , including\nthose with right-sided infective endocarditis. Efficacy of treatment with daptomycin in left-sided endocarditis has\nnot been demonstrated. Additionally, daptomycin is inactivated by pulmonary surfactants; thus, it should never be\nused in the treatment of pneumonia. Daptomycin is dosed IV once daily. Figure 29.19 provides a comparison of\nimportant characteristics of vancomycin, daptomycin, and lipoglycopeptides.\nFigure 29.18 Antimicrobial spectrum of daptomycin. MRSA = methicillin-resistant S .\naureus ; MSSA = methicillin-susceptible S . aureus .\n1082\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1083 ---\n\nFigure 29.19 Side-by-side comparison of vancomycin, daptomycin, and telavancin.\n1083\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1084 ---\n\nIX.  Fosfomycin\nFosfomycin [fos-foe-MYE-sin] is a bactericidal synthetic derivative of phosphonic acid. It blocks cell wall synthesis\nby inhibiting the enzyme enolpyruvyl transferase, a key step in peptidoglycan synthesis. It is indicated for urinary\ntract infections caused by E. coli  or E . faecalis  and is considered first-line therapy for acute cystitis. Due to its\nunique structure and mechanism of action, cross-resistance with other antimicrobial agents is unlikely. Fosfomycin\nis rapidly absorbed after oral administration and distributes well to the kidneys, bladder, and prostate. The drug is\nexcreted in its active form in the urine and maintains high concentrations over several days, allowing for a one-time\ndose. [Note: A parenteral formulation is available in select countries and has been used for the treatment of systemic\ninfections.] The most commonly reported adverse effects include diarrhea, vaginitis, nausea, and headache.\n1084\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1085 ---\n\nX.  Polymyxins\nThe polymyxins are cation polypeptides that bind to phospholipids on the bacterial cell membrane of gram-negative\nbacteria. They have a detergent-like effect that disrupts cell membrane integrity, leading to leakage of cellular\ncomponents and cell death. Polymyxins are concentration-dependent bactericidal agents with activity against most\nclinically important gram-negative bacteria, including P. aeruginosa , E. coli , K. pneumoniae , Acinetobacter  spp.,\nand Enterobacter  spp. However, alterations in the cell membrane, lipid polysaccharides allow many species of\nProteus  and Serratia  to be intrinsically resistant. Only two forms of polymyxin are in clinical use today, polymyxin B\nand colistin (polymyxin E ). Polymyxin B  is available in parenteral, ophthalmic, otic, and topical preparations.\nColistin is only available as a prodrug, colistimethate sodium, which is administered IV or inhaled via a nebulizer.\nThe use of these drugs has been limited due to the increased risk of nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity (for example,\nslurred speech, muscle weakness) when used systemically. However, with increasing gram-negative resistance, they\nare now commonly used as salvage therapy for patients with multidrug-resistant infections. Careful dosing and\nmonitoring of adverse effects are important to maximize the safety and efficacy of these agents.\n1085\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1086 ---\n\n29.1\n29.2\n29.3\n29.4\n29.5\n29.6Study Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nA 45-year-old man presented to the hospital 3 days ago with severe cellulitis and a large abscess on his left\nleg. Incision and drainage were performed on the abscess, and cultures revealed methicillin-resistant\nStaphylococcus aureus. Which is the most appropriate treatment option for once-daily outpatient intravenous\ntherapy in this patient?\nA.  Ertapenem\nB.  Ceftaroline\nC.  Daptomycin\nD.  Piperacillin/tazobactam\nCorrect answer = C. Daptomycin is approved for skin and skin structure infections caused by MRSA and is given\nonce daily. A and D are incorrect because they do not cover MRSA. Ceftaroline covers MRSA, but it must be\ngiven twice daily.\nWhich of the following adverse effects is associated with daptomycin?\nA.  Ototoxicity\nB.  Red man syndrome\nC.  QTc prolongation\nD.  Rhabdomyolysis\nCorrect answer = D. Ototoxicity and red man syndrome are associated with vancomycin. QTc prolongation is\nassociated with telavancin. Myalgias and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with daptomycin therapy and\nrequire patient education and monitoring.\nA 72-year-old man is admitted to the hospital from a nursing home with severe pneumonia. He was\ndischarged from the hospital 1 week ago after open heart surgery. The patient has no known allergies. Which\nof the following regimens is most appropriate for empiric coverage of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcusaureus  and Pseudomonas aeruginosa  in this patient?\nA.  Vancomycin + cefepime + ciprofloxacin\nB.  Vancomycin + cefazolin + ciprofloxacin\nC.  Telavancin + cefepime + ciprofloxacin\nD.  Daptomycin + cefepime + ciprofloxacin\nCorrect answer = A. Vancomycin provides adequate coverage against MRSA, and cefepime and ciprofloxacin\nprovide adequate empiric coverage of Pseudomonas. B is incorrect because cefazolin does not have activity\nagainst Pseudomonas . C is incorrect because telavancin should be avoided if possible with drugs that prolong the\nQTc interval, in this case ciprofloxacin. Daptomycin is inactivated by pulmonary surfactant and should not be\nused for pneumonia.\nA 23-year-old man presents with acute appendicitis that ruptures shortly after admission. He is taken to the\noperating room for surgery, and postsurgical cultures reveal Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis ,\nsusceptibilities pending. Which of the following provides adequate empiric coverage of these two\npathogens?\nA.  Cefepime\nB.  Piperacillin/tazobactam\nC.  Aztreonam\nD.  Ceftaroline\nCorrect answer = B. While all of these agents cover most strains of E. coli, piperacillin/tazobactam is the only\ndrug on this list that provides coverage against Bacteroides  species.\nA 68-year-old man presents from a nursing home with fever, increased urinary frequency and urgency, and\nmental status changes. He has a penicillin allergy of anaphylaxis. Which of the following β-lactams is the\nmost appropriate choice for gram-negative coverage of this patient’s urinary tract infection?\nA.  Cefepime\nB.  Ertapenem\nC.  Aztreonam\nD.  Ceftaroline\nCorrect answer = C. Based on the severity of the allergic reaction, aztreonam is the choice of all the β-lactams.\nAlthough cross-reactivity with cephalosporins and carbapenems is low, the risk rarely outweighs the benefit in\nthese cases.\nA 25-year-old man presents to the urgent care center with a painless sore on his genitals that started 2 weeks\nago. He reports unprotected sex with a new partner about a month ago. A blood test confirms the patient has1086\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1087 ---\n\n29.7\n29.8\n29.9\n29.10Treponema pallidum . Which is the drug of choice for the treatment of this patient's infection as a single\ndose?\nA.  Benzathine penicillin G\nB.  Ceftriaxone\nC.  Aztreonam\nD.  Vancomycin\nCorrect answer = A. A single treatment with penicillin is curative for primary and secondary syphilis. No\nantibiotic resistance has been reported, and it remains the drug of choice unless the patient has a severe allergic\nreaction.\nA 20-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with headache, stiff neck, and fever for 2 days and is\ndiagnosed with meningitis. Which is the best agent for the treatment of meningitis in this patient?\nA.  Cefazolin\nB.  Cefdinir\nC.  Cefotaxime\nD.  Cefuroxime axetil\nCorrect answer = C. Cefotaxime is the only drug on this list with adequate CSF penetration to treat meningitis.\nCefdinir and cefuroxime axetil are only available orally, and cefazolin’s CSF penetration and spectrum of\ncoverage against S. pneumoniae  are likely inadequate to treat meningitis.\nWhich of the following cephalosporins has activity against gram-negative anaerobic pathogens like\nBacteroides fragilis?\nA.  Cefoxitin\nB.  Cefepime\nC.  Ceftriaxone\nD.  Cefazolin\nCorrect answer = A. The cephamycins (cefoxitin and cefotetan) are the only cephalosporins with in vitro activity\nagainst anaerobic gram-negative pathogens. Cefepime, ceftriaxone, and cefazolin have no appreciable activity\nagainst Bacteroides fragilis.\nIn which of the following cases would it be appropriate to use telavancin?\nA.  A 29-year-old pregnant woman with ventilator-associated pneumonia\nB.  A 76-year-old man with hospital-acquired pneumonia also receiving amiodarone for atrial fibrillation\nC.  A 36-year-old man with cellulitis and abscess growing MRSA\nD.  A 72-year-old woman with a diabetic foot infection growing MRSA who has moderate renal dysfunction\nCorrect answer = C. A is not a good option due to the potential of telavancin harming the fetus. Option B is not a\ngood choice because the patient is on amiodarone, and telavancin can cause QTc prolongation. Option D is not an\nappropriate choice because the patient has baseline renal dysfunction and telavancin should be avoided unless\nbenefit outweighs the risk. Option C is the best choice since telavancin is approved for skin and skin structure\ninfections, and the patient has no apparent contraindication.\nAn 18-year-old woman presents to the urgent care clinic with symptoms of a urinary tract infection. Cultures\nreveal Enterococcus faecalis that is pan sensitive. Which of the following is an appropriate oral option to\ntreat the urinary tract infection in this patient?\nA.  Cephalexin\nB.  Vancomycin\nC.  Cefdinir\nD.  Amoxicillin\nCorrect answer = D. Option A and C are incorrect because enterococci are inherently resistant to all\ncephalosporins. Option B is incorrect because oral vancomycin is not absorbed and would not reach the urinary\ntract in sufficient quantities to treat a urinary tract infection. Option D is the best choice, as amoxicillin is well\nabsorbed orally and concentrates in the urine.\n1087\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1088 ---\n\n30\nProtein Synthesis Inhibitors\nJacqueline Jourjy\n1088\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1089 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nA number of antibiotics exert their antimicrobial effects by targeting bacterial ribosomes and inhibiting bacterial\nprotein synthesis. Most of these agents exhibit bacteriostatic activity. Bacterial ribosomes differ structurally from\nmammalian cytoplasmic ribosomes and are composed of 30S and 50S subunits (mammalian ribosomes have 40S\nand 60S subunits). In general, selectivity for bacterial ribosomes minimizes potential adverse consequences\nencountered with the disruption of protein synthesis in mammalian host cells. However, high concentrations of\ndrugs such as chloramphenicol  or the tetracyclines may cause toxic effects as a result of interaction with\nmitochondrial mammalian ribosomes, because the structure of mitochondrial ribosomes more closely resembles\nbacterial ribosomes. Figure 30.1 summarizes the antimicrobial protein synthesis inhibitors discussed in this chapter.\n1089\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1090 ---\n\nFigure 30.1 Summary of protein synthesis inhibitors.\n1090\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1091 ---\n\n1091\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1092 ---\n\nII.  Tetracyclines\nTetracyclines consist of four fused rings with a system of conjugated double bonds. Substitutions on these rings alter\nthe individual pharmacokinetics and spectrum of antimicrobial activity.\n1092\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1093 ---\n\nA.  Mechanism of action\nTetracyclines enter susceptible organisms via passive diffusion and by an energy-dependent transport protein\nmechanism unique to the bacterial inner cytoplasmic membrane. Tetracyclines concentrate intracellularly in\nsusceptible organisms. The drugs bind reversibly to the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome. This action prevents\nbinding of tRNA to the mRNA–ribosome complex, thereby inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis (Figure 30.2).\nFigure 30.2 Mechanisms of action of the various protein synthesis inhibitors. aa = amino\nacid.\n1093\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1094 ---\n\nB.  Antibacterial spectrum\nThe tetracyclines are bacteriostatic antibiotics effective against a wide variety of organisms, including gram-positive\nand gram-negative bacteria, protozoa, spirochetes, mycobacteria, and atypical species. They are commonly used in\nthe treatment of acne and Chlamydia infections (Figure 30.3).\nFigure 30.3 Typical therapeutic applications of tetracyclines. *A tetracycline +\ngentamicin.\n1094\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1095 ---\n\nC.  Resistance\nThe most commonly encountered naturally occurring resistance to tetracyclines is an efflux pump that expels drug\nout of the cell, thus preventing intracellular accumulation. Other mechanisms of bacterial resistance to tetracyclines\ninclude enzymatic inactivation of the drug and production of bacterial proteins that prevent tetracyclines from\nbinding to the ribosome. Resistance to one tetracycline does not confer universal resistance to all tetracyclines, and\nthe development of cross-resistance may be dependent on the mechanism of resistance.\n1095\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1096 ---\n\nD.  Pharmacokinetics\n1.  Absorption\nTetracyclines are adequately absorbed after oral ingestion ( Figure 30.4). Administration with dairy products or other\nsubstances that contain divalent and trivalent cations (for example, magnesium, calcium and aluminum antacids, or\niron supplements) decreases absorption, particularly for tetracycline [tet-rah-SYE-kleen], due to the formation of\nnonabsorbable chelates (Figure 30.5). Both doxycycline [dox-i-SYE-kleen] and minocycline [min-oh-SYE-kleen] are\navailable as oral and intravenous (IV) preparations.\nFigure 30.4 Administration and fate of tetracyclines. CSF = cerebrospinal fluid.\n1096\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1097 ---\n\nFigure 30.5 Effect of antacids and milk on the absorption of tetracyclines.\n2.  Distribution\nThe tetracyclines concentrate well in the bile, liver, kidney, gingival fluid, and skin. Moreover, they bind to tissues\nundergoing calcification (for example, teeth and bones) or to tumors that have high calcium content. Penetration into\nmost body fluids is adequate. Only minocycline and doxycycline achieve therapeutic levels in the cerebrospinal fluid\n(CSF). Minocycline also achieves high concentrations in saliva and tears, rendering it useful in eradicating the\nmeningococcal carrier state. All tetracyclines cross the placental barrier and concentrate in fetal bones and dentition.\n3.  Elimination\nTetracycline is primarily eliminated unchanged in the urine, whereas minocycline undergoes hepatic metabolism and\nis eliminated to a lesser extent via the kidney. Doxycycline is preferred in patients with renal dysfunction, as it is\nprimarily eliminated via the bile into the feces.\n1097\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1098 ---\n\nE.  Adverse effects\n1.  Gastric discomfort\nEpigastric distress commonly results from irritation of the gastric mucosa (Figure 30.6) and is often responsible for\nnoncompliance with tetracyclines. Esophagitis may be minimized through coadministration with food (other than\ndairy products) or fluids and the use of capsules rather than tablets. [Note: Tetracycline should be taken on an empty\nstomach.]\nFigure 30.6 Some adverse effects of tetracyclines. GI = gastrointestinal.\n2.  Effects on calcified tissues\nDeposition in the bone and primary dentition occurs during the calcification process in growing children. This may\ncause discoloration and hypoplasia of teeth and a temporary stunting of growth. For this reason, the use of\n1098\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1099 ---\n\ntetracyclines is limited in pediatrics.\n3.  Hepatotoxicity\nRarely hepatotoxicity may occur with high doses, particularly in pregnant women and those with preexisting hepatic\ndysfunction or renal impairment.\n4.  Phototoxicity\nSevere sunburn may occur in patients receiving a tetracycline who are exposed to sun or ultraviolet rays. This\ntoxicity is encountered with any tetracycline, but more frequently with tetracycline and demeclocycline [dem-e-kloe-\nSYE-kleen]. Patients should be advised to wear adequate sun protection.\n5.  Vestibular dysfunction\nDizziness, vertigo, and tinnitus may occur particularly with minocycline, which concentrates in the endolymph of\nthe ear and affects function.\n6.  Pseudotumor cerebri\nBenign, intracranial hypertension characterized by headache and blurred vision may occur rarely in adults. Although\ndiscontinuation of the drug reverses this condition, it is not clear whether permanent sequelae may occur.\n7.  Contraindications\nThe tetracyclines should not be used in pregnant or breast-feeding women or in children less than 8 years of age.\n1099\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1100 ---\n\nIII.  Glycylcyclines\nTigecycline [tye-ge-SYE-kleen], a derivative of minocycline, is the first member of the glycylcycline antimicrobial\nclass. It is indicated for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections, complicated intra-abdominal\ninfections, and community-acquired pneumonia.\n1100\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1101 ---\n\nA.  Mechanism of action\nTigecycline exhibits bacteriostatic action by reversibly binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit and inhibiting bacterial\nprotein synthesis.\n1101\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1102 ---\n\nB.  Antibacterial spectrum\nTigecycline exhibits broad-spectrum activity that includes methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRSA), multidrug-\nresistant streptococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing gram-\nnegative bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii , and many anaerobic organisms. Tigecycline is not active against\nMorganella , Proteus , Providencia , or Pseudomonas  species.\n1102\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1103 ---\n\nC.  Resistance\nTigecycline was developed to overcome the emergence of tetracycline class–resistant organisms that utilize efflux\npumps and ribosomal protection to confer resistance. Resistance to tigecycline has been observed and is primarily\nattributed to overexpression of efflux pumps.\n1103\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1104 ---\n\nD.  Pharmacokinetics\nFollowing IV infusion, tigecycline exhibits a large volume of distribution. It penetrates tissues well but achieves low\nplasma concentrations. Consequently, tigecycline is a poor option for bloodstream infections. The primary route of\nelimination is biliary/fecal. No dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with renal impairment; however, a\ndose reduction is recommended in severe hepatic dysfunction.\n1104\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1105 ---\n\nE.  Adverse effects\nTigecycline is associated with significant nausea and vomiting. Acute pancreatitis, including fatality, has been\nreported with therapy. Elevations in liver enzymes and serum creatinine may also occur. All-cause mortality in\npatients treated with tigecycline is higher than with other agents. A boxed warning states that tigecycline should be\nreserved for use in situations when alternative treatments are not suitable. Other adverse effects are similar to those\nof the tetracyclines and include photosensitivity, pseudotumor cerebri, discoloration of permanent teeth when used\nduring tooth development, and fetal harm when administered in pregnancy. Tigecycline may decrease the clearance\nof warfarin. Therefore, the international normalized ratio should be monitored closely when tigecycline is\ncoadministered with warfarin.\n1105\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1106 ---\n\nIV.  Aminoglycosides\nAminoglycosides are used for the treatment of serious infections due to aerobic gram-negative bacilli; however, their\nclinical utility is limited due to serious toxicities.\n1106\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1107 ---\n\nA.  Mechanism of action\nAminoglycosides diffuse through porin channels in the outer membrane of susceptible organisms. These organisms\nalso have an oxygen-dependent system that transports the drug across the cytoplasmic membrane. Inside the cell,\nthey bind the 30S ribosomal subunit, where they interfere with assembly of the functional ribosomal apparatus\nand/or cause the 30S subunit of the completed ribosome to misread the genetic code (Figure 30.2). Aminoglycosides\nhave concentration-dependent bactericidal activity; that is, their efficacy is dependent on the maximum\nconcentration (Cmax) of drug above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the organism. For\naminoglycosides, the target Cmax is eight to ten times the MIC. They also exhibit a postantibiotic effect (PAE),\nwhich is continued bacterial suppression after drug concentrations fall below the MIC. The larger the dose, the\nlonger the PAE. Because of these properties, high-dose extended-interval dosing is commonly utilized. This dosing\nstrategy also reduces the risk of nephrotoxicity and increases convenience.\n1107\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1108 ---\n\nB.  Antibacterial spectrum\nThe aminoglycosides are effective for the majority of aerobic gram-negative bacilli, including those that may be\nmultidrug resistant, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Enterobacter  sp. Additionally,\naminoglycosides are often combined with a β-lactam antibiotic to employ a synergistic effect, particularly in the\ntreatment of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium  infective endocarditis. Some therapeutic applications\nof four commonly used aminoglycosides—amikacin [am-i-KAY-sin], gentamicin [jen-ta-MYE-sin], tobramycin\n[toe-bra-MYE-sin], and streptomycin [strep-toe-MYE-sin]—are shown in Figure 30.7.\n1108\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1109 ---\n\n1109\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1110 ---\n\nFigure 30.7 Typical therapeutic applications of aminoglycosides. UTI = urinary tract\ninfection.\n1110\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1111 ---\n\nC.  Resistance\nResistance to aminoglycosides occurs via: 1) efflux pumps, 2) decreased uptake, and/or 3) modification and\ninactivation by plasmid-associated synthesis of enzymes. Each of these enzymes has its own aminoglycoside\nspecificity; therefore, cross-resistance cannot be presumed. [Note: Amikacin is less vulnerable to these enzymes than\nother antibiotics in this group.]\n1111\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1112 ---\n\nD.  Pharmacokinetics\n1.  Absorption\nThe highly polar, polycationic structure of the aminoglycosides prevents adequate absorption after oral\nadministration; therefore, all aminoglycosides (except neomycin [nee-oh-MYE-sin]) must be given parenterally to\nachieve adequate serum concentrations (Figure 30.8). [Note: Neomycin is not given parenterally due to severe\nnephrotoxicity. It is administered topically for skin infections or orally to decontaminate the gastrointestinal tract\nprior to colorectal surgery.]\nFigure 30.8 Administration and fate of aminoglycosides. CNS = central nervous system.\n2.  Distribution\nBecause of their hydrophilicity, aminoglycoside tissue concentrations may be subtherapeutic, and penetration into\nmost body fluids is variable. Concentrations achieved in CSF are inadequate, even in the presence of inflamed\nmeninges. For central nervous system infections, the intrathecal or intraventricular routes may be utilized. All\naminoglycosides cross the placental barrier and may accumulate in fetal plasma and amniotic fluid.\n3.  Elimination\nMore than 90% of the parenteral aminoglycosides are excreted unchanged in the urine ( Figure 30.8). Accumulation\noccurs in patients with renal dysfunction; thus, dose adjustments are required. Neomycin is primarily excreted\nunchanged in the feces.\n1112\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1113 ---\n\nE.  Adverse effects\nTherapeutic drug monitoring of gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin plasma concentrations is imperative to ensure\nappropriateness of dosing and to minimize dose-related toxicities (Figure 30.9). The elderly are particularly\nsusceptible to nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity.\nFigure 30.9 Some adverse effects of aminoglycosides.\n1.  Ototoxicity\nOtotoxicity (vestibular and auditory) is directly related to high peak plasma concentrations and the duration of\ntreatment. Aminoglycosides accumulate in the endolymph and perilymph of the inner ear. Deafness may be\nirreversible and has been known to affect developing fetuses. Patients simultaneously receiving concomitant\nototoxic drugs, such as cisplatin or loop diuretics, are particularly at risk. Vertigo (especially in patients receiving\nstreptomycin) may also occur.\n1113\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1114 ---\n\n2.  Nephrotoxicity\nRetention of the aminoglycosides by the proximal tubular cells disrupts calcium-mediated transport processes. This\nresults in kidney damage ranging from mild, reversible renal impairment to severe, potentially irreversible acute\ntubular necrosis.\n3.  Neuromuscular paralysis\nThis adverse effect is associated with a rapid increase in concentration (for example, high doses infused over a short\nperiod) or concurrent administration with neuromuscular blockers. Patients with myasthenia gravis are particularly\nat risk. Prompt administration of calcium gluconate or neostigmine can reverse the block that causes neuromuscular\nparalysis.\n4.  Allergic reactions\nContact dermatitis is a common reaction to topically applied neomycin.\n1114\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1115 ---\n\nV.  Macrolides and Ketolides\nThe macrolides are a group of antibiotics with a macrocyclic lactone structure to which one or more deoxy sugars\nare attached. Erythromycin [er-ith-roe-MYE-sin] was the first of these drugs to have clinical application, both as a\ndrug of first choice and as an alternative to penicillin in individuals with an allergy to β-lactam antibiotics.\nClarithromycin [kla-rith-roe-MYE-sin] (a methylated form of erythromycin) and azithromycin [a-zith-roe-MYE-sin]\n(having a larger lactone ring) have some features in common with, and others that improve upon, erythromycin.\nTelithromycin [tel-ith-roe-MYE-sin], a semisynthetic derivative of erythromycin, is a “ketolide” antimicrobial agent\n(no longer used in the United States).\n1115\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1116 ---\n\nA.  Mechanism of action\nThe macrolides and ketolides bind irreversibly to a site on the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, thus inhibiting\ntranslocation steps of protein synthesis (Figure 30.2). They may also interfere with other steps, such as\ntranspeptidation. Generally considered to be bacteriostatic, they may be bactericidal at higher doses. Their binding\nsite is either identical to or in close proximity to that for clindamycin and chloramphenicol.\n1116\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1117 ---\n\nB.  Antibacterial spectrum\n1.  Erythromycin\nThis drug is effective against many of the same organisms as penicillin G (Figure 30.10); therefore, it may be\nconsidered as an alternative in patients with penicillin allergy.\nFigure 30.10 Typical therapeutic applications of macrolides.\n2.  Clarithromycin\nClarithromycin has activity similar to erythromycin, but it is also effective against Haemophilus influenzae  and has\ngreater activity against intracellular pathogens such as Chlamydia , Legionella , Moraxella , Ureaplasma  species, and\nHelicobacter pylori .\n3.  Azithromycin\nAlthough less active than erythromycin against streptococci and staphylococci , azithromycin is far more active\nagainst respiratory pathogens such as H. influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis . Extensive use of azithromycin has\nresulted in growing Streptococcus pneumoniae  resistance.\n4.  Telithromycin\nTelithromycin has an antimicrobial spectrum similar to that of azithromycin. Moreover, the structural modification\nwithin ketolides neutralizes the most common resistance mechanisms that render macrolides ineffective.\n1117\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1118 ---\n\nC.  Resistance\nResistance to macrolides is associated with: 1) the inability of the organism to take up the antibiotic, 2) the presence\nof efflux pumps, 3) a decreased affinity of the 50S ribosomal subunit for the antibiotic due to methylation of an\nadenine in the 23S bacterial ribosomal RNA in gram-positive organisms, and 4) the presence of plasmid- associated\nerythromycin esterases in gram-negative organisms such as the Enterobacteriaceae. Erythromycin has limited\nclinical use due to increasing resistance. Both clarithromycin and azithromycin share some cross-resistance with\nerythromycin. Telithromycin may be effective against macrolide-resistant organisms.\n1118\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1119 ---\n\nD.  Pharmacokinetics\n1.  Absorption\nThe erythromycin base is destroyed by gastric acid; thus, either enteric-coated tablets or esterified forms of the\nantibiotic are administered and all have adequate oral absorption (Figure 30.11). Clarithromycin, azithromycin, and\ntelithromycin are stable in stomach acid and are readily absorbed. Food interferes with the absorption of\nerythromycin and azithromycin but can increase that of clarithromycin. Telithromycin is administered orally without\nregard to meals. Erythromycin and azithromycin are available in IV formulations.\nFigure 30.11 Administration and fate of the macrolide antibiotics. CNS = central nervous\nsystem.\n2.  Distribution\nErythromycin distributes well to all body fluids except the CSF. It is one of the few antibiotics that diffuse into\nprostatic fluid, and it also accumulates in macrophages. All four drugs concentrate in the liver. Clarithromycin,\nazithromycin, and telithromycin are widely distributed in the tissues. Azithromycin concentrates in neutrophils,\nmacrophages, and fibroblasts, and serum concentrations are low. It has the largest volume of distribution of the four\ndrugs\n3.  Elimination\nErythromycin and telithromycin undergo hepatic metabolism. They inhibit the oxidation of a number of drugs\nthrough their interaction with the cytochrome P450 system. Interference with the metabolism of drugs such as\ntheophylline, statins, and numerous antiepileptics has been reported for clarithromycin.\n4.  Excretion\nAzithromycin is primarily concentrated and excreted in the bile as active drug. Erythromycin and its metabolites are\nalso excreted in the bile (Figure 30.11). Partial reabsorption occurs through the enterohepatic circulation. In contrast,\nclarithromycin is hepatically metabolized, and the active drug and its metabolites are mainly excreted in the urine\n(Figure 30.12). The dosage of this drug should be adjusted in patients with renal impairment.\n1119\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1120 ---\n\nFigure 30.12 Some properties of the macrolide antibiotics.\n1120\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1121 ---\n\nE.  Adverse effects\n1.  Gastric distress and motility\nGastrointestinal upset is the most common adverse effect of the macrolides and may lead to poor patient compliance\n(especially with erythromycin). The other macrolides seem to be better tolerated (Figure 30.13). Higher doses of\nerythromycin lead to smooth muscle contractions that result in the movement of gastric contents to the duodenum,\nan adverse effect sometimes employed for the treatment of gastroparesis or postoperative ileus.\nFigure 30.13 Some adverse effects of macrolide antibiotics.\n2.  Cholestatic jaundice\nThis adverse effect occurs most commonly with the estolate form of erythromycin (not used in the United States);\nhowever, it has been reported with other formulations and other agents in this class.\n1121\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1122 ---\n\n3.  Ototoxicity\nTransient deafness has been associated with erythromycin, especially at high dosages. Azithromycin has also been\nassociated with irreversible sensorineural hearing loss.\n4.  QT c prolongation\nMacrolides and ketolides may prolong the QTc interval and should be used with caution in those patients with\nproarrhythmic conditions or concomitant use of proarrhythmic agents.\n5.  Contraindications\nPatients with hepatic dysfunction should be treated cautiously with erythromycin, telithromycin, or azithromycin,\nbecause these drugs accumulate in the liver. Severe hepatotoxicity with telithromycin has limited its use, given the\navailability of alternative therapies.\n6.  Drug Interactions\nErythromycin, telithromycin, and clarithromycin inhibit the hepatic metabolism of a number of drugs, which can\nlead to toxic accumulation of these compounds (Figure 30.14). An interaction with digoxin may occur. One theory\nto explain this interaction is that the antibiotic eliminates a species of intestinal flora that ordinarily inactivates\ndigoxin, leading to greater reabsorption of digoxin from the enterohepatic circulation.\nFigure 30.14 Inhibition of the cytochrome P450 system by erythromycin, clarithromycin,\nand telithromycin.\n1122\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1123 ---\n\nVI.  Fidaxomicin\nFidaxomicin [fye-DAX-oh-MYE-sin] is a macrocyclic antibiotic with a structure similar to the macrolides; however,\nit has a unique mechanism of action. Fidaxomicin acts on the sigma subunit of RNA polymerase, thereby disrupting\nbacterial transcription, terminating protein synthesis and resulting in cell death in susceptible organisms.\nFidaxomicin has a very narrow spectrum of activity limited to gram-positive aerobes and anaerobes. While it\npossesses activity against staphylococci and enterococci, it is used primarily for its bactericidal activity against\nClostridium difficile. Because of the unique target site, cross-resistance with other antibiotic classes has not been\ndocumented. Following oral administration, fidaxomicin has minimal systemic absorption and primarily remains\nwithin the gastrointestinal tract. This is ideal for the treatment of C. difficile  infection, which occurs in the gut. The\nmost common adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Anemia and neutropenia have been\nobserved infrequently. Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema, dyspnea, and pruritus have occurred.\nFidaxomicin should be used with caution in patients with a macrolide allergy, as they may be at increased risk for\nhypersensitivity.\n1123\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1124 ---\n\nVII.  Chloramphenicol\nThe use of chloramphenicol  [klor-am-FEN-i-kole], a broad-spectrum antibiotic, is restricted to life-threatening\ninfections for which no alternatives exist.\n1124\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1125 ---\n\nA.  Mechanism of action\nChloramphenicol  binds reversibly to the bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit and inhibits protein synthesis at the\npeptidyl transferase reaction (Figure 30.2). Because of some similarity of mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes to\nthose of bacteria, protein and ATP synthesis in these organelles may be inhibited at high circulating\nchloramphenicol  concentrations, producing bone marrow toxicity. [Note: The oral formulation of chloramphenicol\nwas removed from the US market due to this toxicity.]\n1125\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1126 ---\n\nB.  Antibacterial spectrum\nChloramphenicol  is active against many types of microorganisms including chlamydiae, rickettsiae, spirochetes, and\nanaerobes. The drug is primarily bacteriostatic, but it may exert bactericidal activity depending on the dose and\norganism.\n1126\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1127 ---\n\nC.  Resistance\nResistance is conferred by the presence of enzymes that inactivate chloramphenicol . Other mechanisms include\ndecreased ability to penetrate the organism and ribosomal binding site alterations.\n1127\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1128 ---\n\nD.  Pharmacokinetics\nChloramphenicol  is administered intravenously and is widely distributed throughout the body. It reaches therapeutic\nconcentrations in the CSF. Chloramphenicol  primarily undergoes hepatic metabolism to an inactive glucuronide,\nwhich is secreted by the renal tubule and eliminated in the urine. Dose reductions are necessary in patients with liver\ndysfunction or cirrhosis. Chloramphenicol  is also secreted into breast milk and should be avoided in breastfeeding\nmothers.\n1128\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1129 ---\n\nE.  Adverse effects\n1.  Anemias\nPatients may experience dose-related anemia, hemolytic anemia (observed in patients with glucose-6-phosphate\ndehydrogenase deficiency), and aplastic anemia. [Note: Aplastic anemia is independent of dose and may occur after\ntherapy has ceased.]\n2.  Gray baby syndrome\nNeonates have a low capacity to glucuronidate the antibiotic, and they have underdeveloped renal function, which\ndecreases their ability to excrete the drug. This leads to drug accumulation to concentrations that interfere with the\nfunction of mitochondrial ribosomes, causing poor feeding, depressed breathing, cardiovascular collapse, cyanosis\n(hence the term “gray baby”), and death. Adults who have received very high doses of chloramphenicol  may also\nexhibit this toxicity.\n3.  Drug interactions\nChloramphenicol  inhibits some of the hepatic mixed-function oxidases, preventing the metabolism of drugs such as\nwarfarin and phenytoin, which may potentiate their effects.\n1129\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1130 ---\n\nVIII.  Clindamycin\nClindamycin [klin-da-MYE-sin] has a mechanism of action that is similar to that of the macrolides. Clindamycin is\nused primarily in the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive organisms, including MRSA and\nstreptococcus, and anaerobic bacteria. Resistance mechanisms are the same as those for erythromycin, and cross-\nresistance has been described. C. difficile  is resistant to clindamycin, and the utility of clindamycin for gram-\nnegative anaerobes (for example, Bacteroides  sp.) is decreasing due to increasing resistance. Clindamycin is\navailable in both IV and oral formulations, but use of oral clindamycin is limited by gastrointestinal intolerance. It\ndistributes well into all body fluids but exhibits poor entry into the CSF. Clindamycin undergoes extensive oxidative\nmetabolism to active and inactive products and is excreted into bile and urine. Low urinary excretion of active drug\nlimits its clinical utility for urinary tract infections (Figure 30.15). Accumulation has been reported in patients with\neither severe renal impairment or hepatic failure. In addition to skin rash, the most common adverse effect is\ndiarrhea, which may represent a serious pseudomembranous colitis caused by overgrowth of C. difficile. Oral\nadministration of either metronidazole or vancomycin is usually effective in the treatment of C. difficile  infection.\nFigure 30.15 Administration and fate of clindamycin.\n1130\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1131 ---\n\nIX.  Quinupristin/Dalfopristin\nQuinupristin/dalfopristin [KWIN-yoo-pris-tin/DAL-foh-pris-tin] is a mixture of two streptogramins in a ratio of 30\nto 70, respectively. Due to significant adverse effects, this combination drug is normally reserved for the treatment\nof severe infections caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) in the absence of other therapeutic\noptions.\n1131\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1132 ---\n\nA.  Mechanism of action\nEach component of this combination drug binds to a separate site on the 50S bacterial ribosome. Dalfopristin\ndisrupts elongation by interfering with the addition of new amino acids to the peptide chain. Quinupristin prevents\nelongation similar to the macrolides and causes release of incomplete peptide chains. Thus, they synergistically\ninterrupt protein synthesis. The combination drug has bactericidal activity against most susceptible organisms and\nhas a long PAE.\n1132\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1133 ---\n\nB.  Antibacterial spectrum\nQuinupristin/dalfopristin is active primarily against gram-positive cocci, including those resistant to other\nantibiotics. Its primary use is for the treatment of E. faecium  infections, including VRE strains, against which it is\nbacteriostatic. The drug is not effective against E. faecalis .\n1133\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1134 ---\n\nC.  Resistance\nEnzymatic processes commonly account for resistance to these agents. For example, the presence of a ribosomal\nenzyme that methylates the target bacterial 23S ribosomal RNA site can interfere in quinupristin binding. In some\ncases, the enzymatic modification can change the action from bactericidal to bacteriostatic. Plasmid-associated\nacetyltransferase inactivates dalfopristin. An active efflux pump can also decrease levels of the antibiotics in\nbacteria.\n1134\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1135 ---\n\nD.  Pharmacokinetics\nQuinupristin/dalfopristin is available intravenously. It does not achieve therapeutic concentrations in CSF. Both\ncompounds undergo hepatic metabolism, with excretion mainly in the feces.\n1135\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1136 ---\n\nE.  Adverse effects\nVenous irritation commonly occurs when quinupristin/dalfopristin is administered through a peripheral rather than a\ncentral line. Hyperbilirubinemia occurs in about 25% of patients, resulting from a competition with the antibiotic for\nexcretion. Arthralgia and myalgia have been reported when higher doses are administered. Quinupristin/dalfopristin\ninhibits the cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 isoenzyme, and concomitant administration with drugs that are metabolized\nby this pathway may lead to toxicities.\n1136\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1137 ---\n\nX.  Oxazolidinones\nLinezolid [lih-NEH-zo-lid] and tedizolid [ted-eye-ZOE-lid] are synthetic oxazolidinones developed to combat gram-\npositive organisms, including resistant isolates such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , VRE, and\npenicillin-resistant streptococci.\n1137\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1138 ---\n\nA.  Mechanism of action\nLinezolid and tedizolid bind to the bacterial 23S ribosomal RNA of the 50S subunit, thereby inhibiting the formation\nof the 70S initiation complex (Figure 30.2) and translation of bacterial proteins.\n1138\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1139 ---\n\nB.  Antibacterial spectrum\nThe antibacterial action of the oxazolidinones is directed primarily against gram-positive organisms such as\nstaphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci, Corynebacterium  species and Listeria monocytogenes . It is also\nmoderately active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis  (Figure 30.16). The main clinical use of linezolid and\ntedizolid is to treat infections caused by drug-resistant gram-positive organisms. Like other agents that interfere with\nbacterial protein synthesis, linezolid and tedizolid are bacteriostatic; however, linezolid has bactericidal activity\nagainst streptococci. Linezolid is an alternative to daptomycin for infections caused by VRE. Because they are\nbacteriostatic, the oxazolidinones are not recommended as first-line treatment for MRSA bacteremia.\nFigure 30.16 Antimicrobial spectrum of oxazolidinones.\n1139\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1140 ---\n\nC.  Resistance\nResistance primarily occurs via reduced binding at the target site. Reduced susceptibility and resistance have been\nreported in S. aureus  and Enterococcus  sp. Cross-resistance with other protein synthesis inhibitors does not occur.\n1140\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1141 ---\n\nD.  Pharmacokinetics\nLinezolid and tedizolid are well absorbed after oral administration. IV formulations are also available. These drugs\ndistribute widely throughout the body. Although the metabolic pathway of linezolid has not been fully determined, it\nis known that it is metabolized via oxidation to two inactive metabolites. The drug is excreted both by renal and\nnonrenal routes. Tedizolid is metabolized by sulfation, and the majority of elimination occurs via the liver, and drug\nis mainly excreted in the feces. No dose adjustments are required for either agent for renal or hepatic dysfunction.\n1141\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1142 ---\n\nE.  Adverse effects\nThe most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal upset, nausea, diarrhea, headache, and rash.\nThrombocytopenia has been reported, usually in patients taking the drug for longer than 10 days. Linezolid and\ntedizolid possess nonselective monoamine oxidase activity and may lead to serotonin syndrome if given\nconcomitantly with large quantities of tyramine-containing foods, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or\nmonoamine oxidase inhibitors. The condition is reversible when the drug is discontinued. Irreversible peripheral\nneuropathies and optic neuritis causing blindness have been associated with greater than 28 days of use, limiting\nutility for extended-duration treatments.\n1142\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1143 ---\n\n30.1\n30.2\n30.3\n30.4\n30.5\n30.6Study Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nWhich of the following adverse effects is often employed as a therapeutic use for erythromycin?\nA.  QTc prolongation\nB.  Increased gastrointestinal motility\nC.  Photosensitivity\nD.  Deposition in bone\nCorrect answer = B. Macrolides, but especially erythromycin, cause GI distress and increase motility of the GI\ntract, which is often used to treat gastroparesis and/or postoperative ileus. QTc prolongation is an adverse effect\nof erythromycin but not one employed therapeutically. Photosensitivity and deposition in bone are adverse effects\nof tetracyclines.\nWhich of the following describes the mechanism of action of tetracycline antibiotics?\nA.  Bind the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, preventing binding of tRNA to the mRNA–ribosome complex.\nB.  Bind the 30S ribosomal subunit, interfering with assembly of the functional ribosomal apparatus.\nC.  Bind irreversibly to a site on the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, inhibiting translocation steps of protein\nsynthesis.\nD.  Bind the bacterial 23S ribosomal RNA of the 50S subunit, inhibiting the formation of the 70S initiation complex.\nCorrect answer = A. Tetracyclines enter susceptible organisms via passive diffusion and also by an energy-\ndependent transport protein mechanism unique to the bacterial inner cytoplasmic membrane. The drugs bind\nreversibly to the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome. This action prevents binding of tRNA to the mRNA–\nribosome complex, thereby inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. B is the mechanism for aminoglycosides, C is\nthe mechanism for macrolides, and D is the mechanism for oxazolidinones.\nLinezolid would be a good choice for antibiotic treatment in which of the following patient scenarios?\nA.  Bacteremia caused by Staphylococcus aureusB.  Urinary tract infection caused by Escherichia coli\nC.  Pneumonia caused by drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae\nD.  Diabetic foot infection caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa\nCorrect answer = C. Linezolid does have coverage against resistant S. pneumoniae . It is not an optimal choice for\ntreatment of bacteremia. Linezolid also does not have gram-negative coverage against E. coli  and P. aeruginosa .\nAfter 5 days of clindamycin treatment for a skin infection, a patient develops diarrhea (10 watery stools/day),\nsevere abdominal pain, and fever. Which of the following organisms would you be concerned about as the\ncausative pathogen of diarrhea?\nA.  Escherichia coliB.  Bacteroides fragilis\nC.  Staphylococcus aureus\nD.  Clostridium difficile\nCorrect answer = D. Clindamycin use has been associated with Clostridium difficile –associated diarrhea. This\ninfection should be considered in a patient who presents with diarrhea while on clindamycin.\nWhich of the following statements accurately describes the difference in spectrum of activity between\nerythromycin and azithromycin?\nA.  Azithromycin has better activity against respiratory pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella\ncatarrhalis  but less potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.\nB.  Erythromycin has the same activity as azithromycin against gram-positives and gram-negatives.\nC.  Azithromycin has better activity against staphylococci and streptococci compared to erythromycin.\nD.  Erythromycin has better activity against gram-negatives such as H. influenza.Correct answer = A. Erythromycin has better activity against gram-positive organisms, so B and C are incorrect.\nD is incorrect as azithromycin has better activity against H. influenza.\nWhich of the following antibiotic agents should not be given to children less than 8 years of age due to its\ndeposition in bone and teeth?\nA.  Azithromycin\nB.  Doxycycline\nC.  Linezolid\nD.  Quinupristin/dalfopristin\nCorrect answer = B. Tetracyclines are contraindicated in this age group because they are deposited in tissues\nundergoing calcification, such as teeth and bone, and can stunt growth.1143\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1144 ---\n\n30.7\n30.8\n30.9\n30.10A 77-year-old woman was started on antibiotics for pneumonia treatment. After 3 days of antibiotic therapy,\nthe serum creatinine doubled. Which of the following antibiotics is most likely responsible for this increase\nin serum creatinine?\nA.  Doxycycline\nB.  Clarithromycin\nC.  Tobramycin\nD.  Linezolid\nCorrect answer = C. Aminoglycosides such as tobramycin accumulate in the proximal tubular cells of the kidney\nand disrupt calcium-mediated transport processes. This results in kidney damage ranging from mild, reversible\nrenal impairment to severe, potentially irreversible acute tubular necrosis. Nephrotoxicity is not commonly\nassociated with tetracyclines, macrolides or oxazolidinones.\nA 24-year-old pregnant woman was diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia and will be managed in\nthe outpatient setting. Which antibiotic is a safe option for this patient to treat her pneumonia?\nA.  Azithromycin\nB.  Doxycycline\nC.  Fidaxomicin\nD.  Gentamicin\nCorrect answer = A. Azithromycin is available orally and considered safe in pregnancy. Doxycycline should not\nbe used in pregnancy due to its ability to cross the placenta and affect bone and skeletal development in the fetus.\nFidaxomicin does not reach therapeutic concentrations in serum or at this site of infection. It concentrates in the\ngut. Gentamicin crosses the placental barrier and may accumulate in fetal plasma and amniotic fluid. It would\nalso not be used clinically in this outpatient scenario.\nParents of a 1-month-old baby are told their child has developed “gray baby syndrome.” Which of the\nfollowing antibiotics did the baby likely receive?\nA.  Tobramycin\nB.  Linezolid\nC.  Erythromycin\nD.  Chloramphenicol\nCorrect answer = D. Gray baby syndrome is an adverse effect caused by chloramphenicol in neonates due to their\nunderdeveloped renal function and low capacity to glucuronidate the antibiotic. The other agents do not undergo\nthis glucuronidation.\nAminoglycosides are commonly used for their concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against which\ngroup of organisms?\nA.  Gram-positive aerobes\nB.  Gram-negative aerobes\nC.  Gram-positive anaerobes\nD.  Gram-negative anaerobes\nCorrect answer = B. Although aminoglycosides (such as gentamicin) are sometimes used synergistically against\ngram-positive aerobes, this is not their most common use. They are typically used for their activity against gram-\nnegative aerobes. Aminoglycosides do not have good anaerobic activity.1144\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1145 ---\n\n31\nQuinolones, Folic Acid Antagonists, and Urinary Tract\nAntiseptics\nKenneth P. Klinker and Joseph Pardo\n1145\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1146 ---\n\nI.  Fluoroquinolones\nDiscovery of quinolone antimicrobials led to the development of numerous compounds utilized in clinical practice.\nFollowing synthesis of nalidixic acid in the early 1960s, continued modification of the quinolone nucleus expanded\nthe spectrum of activity, improved pharmacokinetics, and stabilized compounds against common mechanisms of\nresistance. Due to these enhancements, quinolone antimicrobials were rapidly integrated into human and agricultural\nmedicine. Unfortunately, overuse resulted in rising rates of resistance in gram-negative and gram-positive\norganisms, increased frequency of Clostridium difficile infections, and identification of numerous untoward adverse\neffects. Consequently, these agents have been relegated to second-line options for various indications. This chapter\nreviews key characteristics of fluoroquinolones and their role in therapy. The fluoroquinolones and other antibiotics\ndiscussed in this chapter are listed in Figure 31.1.\nFigure 31.1 Summary of drugs described in this chapter.\n1146\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1147 ---\n\n1147\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1148 ---\n\nA.  Mechanism of action\nMost bacterial species maintain two distinct type II topoisomerases that assist with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)\nreplication, DNA gyrase, and topoisomerase IV. DNA gyrase is responsible for reducing torsional stress ahead of\nreplicating forks by breaking double-strand DNA and introducing negative supercoils. Topoisomerase IV assists in\nseparating daughter chromosomes once replication is completed. Following cell wall entry through porin channels,\nfluoroquinolones bind to these enzymes and interfere with DNA ligation. This interference increases the number of\npermanent chromosomal breaks, triggering cell lysis. In general, fluoroquinolones have different targets for gram-\nnegative (DNA gyrase) and gram-positive organisms (topoisomerase IV), resulting in rapid cell death.\n1148\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1149 ---\n\nB.  Antimicrobial spectrum\nFluoroquinolones are bactericidal and exhibit area-under-the-curve/minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC)-\ndependent killing. A major facet of their development centered on improving microbiologic coverage. Modifications\nto the quinolone nucleus steadily improved topoisomerase inhibitory activity and facilitated bacterial cell wall\npenetration. These changes enhanced activity against a variety of pathogens including aerobic gram-negative and\ngram-positive organisms, atypical organisms (for example, Chlamydia, Legionella , and Mycoplasma  spp.), and\nanaerobes. Based on the impact of these structural changes, fluoroquinolones are often classified according to\nspectrum of activity.\nFirst-generation compounds (for example, nalidixic acid) were narrow spectrum agents with activity against\naerobic gram-negative bacilli, mostly Enterobacteriaceae. Second-generation compounds (for example,\nciprofloxacin) exhibit improved intracellular penetration and broadened coverage, which includes\nEnterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae , Neisseria  spp., Chlamydia  spp., and\nLegionella  spp. Third-generation compounds (for example, levofloxacin) maintain the bacterial spectrum of second-\ngeneration agents, with improved activity against Streptococcus  spp., including S. pneumoniae , methicillin-\nsusceptible Staphylococcus aureus , Stenotrophomonas maltophilia , and Mycobacterium  spp. Fourth-generation\ncompounds (moxifloxacin, gemifloxacin, and delafloxacin) have enhanced gram-positive activity, including\nStaphylococcus  and Streptococcus  spp. Delafloxacin has activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus\n(MRSA) and Enterococcus faecalis . Further, delafloxacin and moxifloxacin have activity against Bacteroides fragilis\nand Prevotella  spp., while maintaining activity against Enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae . From this\ngroup, only delafloxacin has activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Lastly, these agents maintain atypical\ncoverage, with moxifloxacin and delafloxacin showing activity against Mycobacteria  spp. Common therapeutic\napplications of fluoroquinolones are shown in Figure 31.2.\nFigure 31.2 Typical therapeutic applications of fluoroquinolones.\n1149\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1150 ---\n\nC.  Resistance\nNumerous mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance exist in clinical pathogens. High-level fluoroquinolone\nresistance is primarily driven by chromosomal mutations within topoisomerases, although decreased entry, efflux\nsystems, and modifying enzymes play a role. Mechanisms responsible for resistance include the following:\n1.  Altered target binding\nMutations in bacterial genes encoding DNA gyrase or topoisomerase IV (for example, gyrA or parC) alter target site\nstructure and reduce binding efficiency of fluoroquinolones.\n2.  Decreased accumulation\nReduced intracellular concentration is linked to 1) a reduction in membrane permeability or 2) efflux pumps.\nAlterations in membrane permeability are mediated through a reduction in outer membrane porin proteins, thus\nlimiting drug access to topoisomerases. Efflux pumps actively remove fluoroquinolones from the cell.\n3.  Fluoroquinolone degradation\nAn aminoglycoside acetyltransferase variant can acetylate fluoroquinolones, rendering them inactive.\n1150\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1151 ---\n\nD.  Pharmacokinetics\n1.  Absorption\nFluoroquinolones are well absorbed after oral administration, with levofloxacin and moxifloxacin having a\nbioavailability that exceeds 90% (Figure 31.3). Ingestion of fluoroquinolones with sucralfate, aluminum- or\nmagnesium-containing antacids, or dietary supplements containing iron or zinc can reduce the absorption. Calcium\nand other divalent cations also interfere with the absorption of these agents (Figure 31.4).\nFigure 31.3 Administration and fate of the fluoroquinolones.\n1151\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1152 ---\n\nFigure 31.4 Effect of dietary calcium on the absorption of ciprofloxacin.\n2.  Distribution\nBinding to plasma proteins ranges from 20% to 84%. Fluoroquinolones distribute well into all tissues and body\nfluids. Concentrations are high in bone, urine (except moxifloxacin), kidney, prostatic tissue (but not prostatic fluid),\nand lungs as compared to serum. Penetration into cerebrospinal fluid is good, and these agents may be considered in\ncertain central nervous system (CNS) infections. Accumulation in macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes\nresults in activity against intracellular organisms such as Listeria, Chlamydia , and Mycobacterium .\n3.  Elimination\nMost fluoroquinolones are excreted renally. Therefore, dosage adjustments are needed in renal dysfunction.\nMoxifloxacin is metabolized primarily by the liver, and while there is some renal excretion, no dose adjustment is\nrequired for renal impairment (see Figure 31.3).\n1152\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1153 ---\n\nE.  Adverse reactions\nIn general, fluoroquinolones are well tolerated ( Figure 31.5). Common adverse effects leading to discontinuation are\nnausea, vomiting, headache, and dizziness. These agents carry boxed warnings for tendinitis, tendon rupture,\nperipheral neuropathy, and CNS effects (hallucinations, anxiety, insomnia, confusion, and seizures). Patients taking\nfluoroquinolones are at risk for phototoxicity resulting in exaggerated sunburn reactions. Patients should use\nsunscreen and avoid excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. Arthropathy is uncommon, but arthralgia and\narthritis are reported with fluoroquinolone use in pediatric patients. Use in the pediatric population should be limited\nto distinct clinical scenarios (for example, cystic fibrosis exacerbation). Hepatotoxicity or blood glucose\ndisturbances (usually in diabetic patients receiving oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin) have been observed.\nIdentification of any of these events should result in prompt removal of the agent. Fluoroquinolones may prolong the\nQTc interval, and these agents should be avoided in patients predisposed to arrhythmias or taking medication\nassociated with QT prolongation. Ciprofloxacin inhibits P450 1A2- and 3A4-mediated metabolism. Serum\nconcentrations of medications such as theophylline, tizanidine, warfarin, ropinirole, duloxetine, caffeine, sildenafil ,\nand zolpidem may be increased (Figure 31.6).\nFigure 31.5 Some adverse reactions to fluoroquinolones.\nFigure 31.6 Drug interactions with ciprofloxacin.\n1153\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1154 ---\n\nF.  Examples of clinically useful fluoroquinolones\nDue to increasing resistance and boxed warnings, fluoroquinolones should be used with caution in select\ncircumstances. They may be considered in patients who do not tolerate other agents (for example, severe beta-lactam\nallergies) or as definitive therapy once susceptibilities are available. Listed below are potential indications for these\nagents.\n1.  Ciprofloxacin\nCiprofloxacin [SIP-roe-FLOX-a-sin] has good activity against gram-negative bacilli, including P. aeruginosa.\nCiprofloxacin is used in the treatment of traveler’s diarrhea, typhoid fever, and anthrax. It is a second-line agent for\ninfections arising from intra-abdominal, lung, skin, or urine sources. Of note, high-dose therapy should be employed\nwhen treating Pseudomonas infections.\n2.  Levofloxacin\nLevofloxacin [leev-oh-FLOX-a-sin] has similar activity to ciprofloxacin and they are often interchanged when\nmanaging gram-negative bacilli, including P. aeruginosa . Levofloxacin has enhanced activity against S. pneumoniae\nand is first-line therapy for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). It is a second-line agent for the treatment of S.\nmaltophilia .\n3.  Moxifloxacin\nMoxifloxacin [mox-ee-FLOX-a-sin] has enhanced activity against gram-positive organisms (for example, S.pneumoniae ), gram-negative anaerobes, and Mycobacterium  spp. The drug may be used for CAP, but not hospital-\nacquired pneumonia due to poor coverage of P. aeruginosa . It may be considered for mild-to-moderate intra-\nabdominal infections, but should be avoided if patients have fluoroquinolone exposure within previous three\nmonths, due to increasing B. fragilis  resistance. Moxifloxacin may be considered as a second-line agent for\nmanagement of drug-susceptible tuberculosis.\n4.  Gemifloxacin\nGemifloxacin [gem-ee-FLOX-a-sin] is indicated for management of community-acquired respiratory infections.\nUnlike the other compounds, it is only available as an oral formulation.\n5.  Delafloxacin\nDelafloxacin [del-a-FLOX-a-sin] has improved activity against gram-positive cocci, including MRSA and\nEnterococcus  spp. Due to its spectrum of activity, it is an option for managing acute bacterial skin and skin structure\ninfections. It is available as an intravenous and oral formulation.\n1154\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1155 ---\n\nII.  Folate Antagonists\nFolic acid is a coenzyme essential in the synthesis of ribonucleic acid (RNA), DNA, and certain amino acids. In the\nabsence of folate, cells cannot grow or divide. Humans use dietary folate to synthesize the critical folate derivative,\ntetrahydrofolic acid. By contrast, many bacteria are impermeable to folate derivatives, and rely on their ability to\nsynthesize folate de novo (Figure 31.7). Sulfonamides (sulfa drugs) are a family of antibiotics that inhibit de novo\nsynthesis of folate. A second type of folate antagonist, trimethoprim, prevents microorganisms from converting\ndihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid. Thus, both sulfonamides and trimethoprim interfere with the ability of an\ninfecting bacterium to perform DNA synthesis and other essential cellular functions. The combination of the\nsulfonamide sulfamethoxazole with trimethoprim (the generic name for the combination is cotrimoxazole) provides a\nsynergistic effect.\n1155\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1156 ---\n\n1156\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1157 ---\n\nFigure 31.7 Inhibition of tetrahydrofolate synthesis by sulfonamides and trimethoprim.\n1157\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1158 ---\n\nIII.  Sulfonamides\nSulfa drugs were among the first antibiotics used in clinical practice. Today, they are seldom prescribed alone except\nin developing countries, where they are employed because of low cost and efficacy.\n1158\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1159 ---\n\nA.  Mechanism of action\nMicroorganisms use the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase to create dihydrofolic acid from the precursor molecule\np-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). Sulfonamides are synthetic analogs of PABA. Because of their structural similarity,\nsulfonamides compete with PABA to inhibit dihydropteroate synthetase and the genesis of bacterial dihydrofolic\nacid (see Figure 31.7). These agents, including cotrimoxazole, are bacteriostatic.\n1159\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1160 ---\n\nB.  Antibacterial spectrum\nSulfa drugs have in vitro activity against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. Common organisms include\nEnterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae , Streptococcus  spp., Staphylococcus  spp., and Nocardia . Additionally,\nsulfadiazine [sul-fa-DYE-a-zeen] in combination with the dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor pyrimethamine [py-ri-\nMETH-a-meen] is the preferred treatment for toxoplasmosis.\n1160\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1161 ---\n\nC.  Resistance\nBacteria that obtain folate from their environment are naturally resistant to sulfa drugs. Acquired bacterial resistance\nto the sulfa drugs can arise from plasmid transfers or random mutations. Resistance may be due to 1) altered\ndihydropteroate synthetase, 2) decreased cellular permeability to sulfa drugs, or 3) enhanced production of the\nnatural substrate, PABA. [Note: Organisms resistant to one member of this drug family are resistant to all.]\n1161\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1162 ---\n\nD.  Pharmacokinetics\n1.  Absorption\nMost sulfa drugs are well absorbed following oral administration (Figure 31.8). An exception is sulfasalazine [sul-\nfa-SAL-a-zeen]. It is not absorbed when administered orally or as a suppository and, therefore, is reserved for\ntreatment of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. [Note: Intestinal flora split sulfasalazine into sulfapyridine and 5-\naminosalicylate, with the latter exerting the anti-inflammatory effect. Absorption of sulfapyridine can lead to\ntoxicity in patients who are slow acetylators.] Intravenous sulfonamides are generally reserved for patients who are\nunable to take oral preparations or have severe infections. Because of the risk of sensitization, sulfa drugs are not\nusually applied topically. However, in burn units, silver sulfadiazine [sul-fa-DYE-ah-zeen] or mafenide [mah-FEN-\nide] acetate (α-amino-p-toluenesulfonamide) creams have been effective in reducing burn-associated sepsis because\nthey prevent colonization of bacteria. [Note: Silver sulfadiazine is preferred because mafenide produces pain on\napplication and its absorption may contribute to acid–base disturbances.]\nFigure 31.8 Administration and fate of the sulfonamides.\n2.  Distribution\nSulfa drugs are bound to serum albumin in circulation and widely distribute throughout body tissues. Sulfa drugs\npenetrate well into cerebrospinal fluid (even in the absence of inflammation) and cross the placental barrier to enter\nfetal tissues.\n3.  Metabolism\nSulfa drugs are acetylated and conjugated primarily in the liver. The acetylated product is devoid of antimicrobial\nactivity but retains the toxic potential to precipitate at neutral or acidic pH. This causes crystalluria (“stone\nformation”; see below) and potential damage to the kidney.\n4.  Excretion\nUnchanged sulfa drug and metabolites are eliminated via glomerular filtration and secretion, requiring dose\nadjustments with renal impairment. Sulfonamides may be eliminated in breast milk.\n1162\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1163 ---\n\n1163\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1164 ---\n\nE.  Adverse effects\n1.  Crystalluria\nNephrotoxicity may develop as a result of crystalluria (Figure 31.9). Adequate hydration and alkalinization of urine\ncan prevent the problem by reducing the concentration of drug and promoting its ionization.\nFigure 31.9 Some adverse reactions to sulfonamides.\n2.  Hypersensitivity\nHypersensitivity reactions, such as rashes, angioedema, or Stevens-Johnson syndrome, may occur. When patients\nreport previous sulfa allergies, it is paramount to acquire a description of the reaction to direct appropriate therapy.\n1164\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1165 ---\n\n3.  Hematopoietic disturbances\nHemolytic anemia is encountered in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.\nGranulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia can also occur. Fatal reactions have been reported from associated\nagranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and other blood dyscrasias.\n4.  Kernicterus\nBilirubin-associated brain damage (kernicterus) may occur in newborns, because sulfa drugs displace bilirubin from\nbinding sites on serum albumin. The bilirubin is then free to pass into the CNS, because the blood–brain barrier is\nnot fully developed.\n5.  Drug potentiation\nSulfamethoxazole potentiates the anticoagulant effect of warfarin due to inhibition of CYP2C9, resulting in reduced\nclearance of warfarin. Sulfonamides may also displace warfarin from binding sites on serum albumin. Serum\nmethotrexate levels may rise through protein binding displacement. Other CYP2C9 substrates, such as phenytoin,\nmay have increased concentrations when given with sulfonamides.\n6.  Contraindications\nDue to the danger of kernicterus, sulfa drugs should be avoided in newborns and infants less than 2 months of age,\nas well as in pregnant women at term. Sulfonamides should not be given to patients receiving methenamine, since\nthey can crystallize in the presence of formaldehyde produced by this agent.\n1165\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1166 ---\n\nIV.  Trimethoprim\nTrimethoprim [try-METH-oh-prim], a potent inhibitor of bacterial dihydrofolate reductase, was initially available in\ncombination with the sulfonamide sulfamethoxazole [sul-fa-meth-OX-a-zole], and later approved for use as a single\nagent. Today, trimethoprim is most commonly used in combination with sulfamethoxazole.\n1166\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1167 ---\n\nA.  Mechanism of action\nTrimethoprim is a potent inhibitor of bacterial dihydrofolate reductase (see Figure 31.7). Inhibition of this enzyme\nprevents the formation of the metabolically active form of folic acid, tetrahydrofolic acid, and thus, interferes with\nnormal bacterial cell functions. Trimethoprim binds to bacterial dihydrofolate reductase more readily than it does to\nhuman dihydrofolate reductase, which accounts for the selective toxicity of the drug.\n1167\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1168 ---\n\nB.  Antibacterial spectrum\nThe antibacterial spectrum of trimethoprim is similar to that of sulfamethoxazole. However, trimethoprim is 20- to\n50-fold more potent than the sulfonamides. Trimethoprim may be used alone in the treatment of urinary tract\ninfections (UTIs) and in the treatment of bacterial prostatitis (although fluoroquinolones and cotrimoxazole are\npreferred).\n1168\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1169 ---\n\nC.  Resistance\nResistance in gram-negative bacteria is due to the presence of an altered dihydrofolate reductase that has a lower\naffinity for trimethoprim. Efflux pumps and decreased permeability to the drug may play a role.\n1169\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1170 ---\n\nD.  Pharmacokinetics\nTrimethoprim is rapidly absorbed following oral administration. Because the drug is a weak base, higher\nconcentrations of trimethoprim are achieved in the relatively acidic prostatic and vaginal fluids. The drug is widely\ndistributed into body tissues and fluids, including penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid. Trimethoprim undergoes\nsome O-demethylation, but 60% to 80% is renally excreted unchanged.\n1170\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1171 ---\n\nE.  Adverse effects\nTrimethoprim can produce the effects of folic acid deficiency. These effects include megaloblastic anemia,\nleukopenia, and granulocytopenia, especially in pregnant patients and those with nutrient-poor diets. These blood\ndisorders may be reversed by simultaneous administration of folinic acid (also known as leucovorin), which does not\nenter bacteria. Trimethoprim has a potassium-sparing effect and may cause hyperkalemia, especially at higher doses\nand when administered with other medication that causes hyperkalemia (for example, angiotensin converting\nenzyme inhibitors).\n1171\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1172 ---\n\nV.  Cotrimoxazole\nThe combination of trimethoprim with sulfamethoxazole, called cotrimoxazole [co-try-MOX-a-zole], shows greater\nantimicrobial activity than equivalent quantities of either drug used alone (Figure 31.10). The combination was\nselected because of the synergistic activity and the similarity in the half-lives of the two drugs.\nFigure 31.10 Synergism between trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole inhibits growth of\nE. coli .\n1172\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1173 ---\n\nA.  Mechanism of action\nThe synergistic antimicrobial activity of cotrimoxazole results from its inhibition of two sequential steps in the\nsynthesis of tetrahydrofolic acid. Sulfamethoxazole inhibits the incorporation of PABA into dihydrofolic acid\nprecursors, and trimethoprim prevents reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate (Figure 31.7).\nFigure 31.11 Typical therapeutic applications of cotrimoxazole (sulfamethoxazole plus\ntrimethoprim).\n1173\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1174 ---\n\nB.  Antibacterial spectrum\nCotrimoxazole has a broader spectrum of antibacterial action than the sulfa drugs alone (Figure 31.11). It is effective\nin treating UTIs and respiratory tract infections, as well as Pneumocystis jirovecii , toxoplasmosis, Listeria\nmonocytogenes , and Salmonella  infections. It has activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus  and can be\nparticularly useful for skin and soft tissue infections caused by this organism. It is the drug of choice for infections\ncaused by susceptible Nocardia spp. and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia .\n1174\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1175 ---\n\nC.  Resistance\nResistance to the trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole combination is encountered less frequently than resistance to\neither of the drugs alone, because it requires bacterium to maintain simultaneous resistance to both drugs.\nSignificant resistance has been documented in a number of clinically relevant organisms, including E. coli .\n1175\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1176 ---\n\nD.  Pharmacokinetics\nCotrimoxazole is generally administered orally (Figure 31.12). Intravenous administration may be utilized in\npatients with severe pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii . Both agents distribute throughout the body.\nTrimethoprim concentrates in the relatively acidic milieu of prostatic fluids, and this accounts for the use of\ntrimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole in the treatment of prostatitis. Cotrimoxazole readily crosses the blood–brain barrier.\nBoth parent drugs and their metabolites are excreted in the urine.\nFigure 31.12 Administration and fate of cotrimoxazole.\n1176\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1177 ---\n\nE.  Adverse effects\nAdverse reactions and drug interactions related to cotrimoxazole are similar to those expected with each of the\nindividual components, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (Figure 31.13). The most common adverse reactions are\nnausea and vomiting, skin rash, hematologic toxicity, and hyperkalemia.\n1177\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1178 ---\n\nFigure 31.13 Some adverse reactions to cotrimoxazole .\n1178\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1179 ---\n\n1179\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1180 ---\n\nVI.  Urinary Tract Antiseptics/Antimicrobials\nUTIs are one of the most common bacterial infections in the world, primarily impacting women and the elderly.\nHistorically, fluoroquinolones and cotrimoxazole have been first-line therapy for the treatment of UTIs.\nUnfortunately, resistance has increased among common pathogens (for example, E. coli ). As a result, methenamine,\nnitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin (see",

Methenamine\n1.  Mechanism of action\nMethenamine [meth-EN-a-meen] salts are hydrolyzed to ammonia and formaldehyde in acidic urine (pH ≤ 5.5).\nFormaldehyde denatures proteins and nucleic acids, resulting in bacterial cell death. Methenamine is combined with\na weak acid (for example, hippuric acid) to maintain urine acidity and promote production of formaldehyde (Figure\n31.14).\nFigure 31.14 Formation of formaldehyde from methenamine at acid pH.\n2.  Antibacterial spectrum\nMethenamine is primarily used for chronic suppressive therapy to reduce the frequency of UTIs. Methenamine is\nactive against E. coli , Enterococcus  spp., and Staphylococcus  spp. It has some activity against Proteus  spp. and\nPseudomonas aeruginosa , but urine pH must be kept acidic to achieve bactericidal activity. The main benefit of\nmethenamine is the lack of selection for resistant organisms.\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\nMethenamine is orally absorbed, with up to 30% decomposing in gastric juices, unless protected by enteric coating.\nIt reaches the urine through tubular secretion and glomerular filtration. Concentrations are sufficient to treat\nsusceptible organisms. Due to ammonia formation, use should be avoided in hepatic insufficiency.\n4.  Adverse effects\nThe major adverse effect of methenamine is gastrointestinal distress, although at higher doses, albuminuria,\nhematuria, and rashes may develop. Methenamine mandelate is contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency,\nbecause mandelic acid may precipitate. The methenamine hippurate formulation should be used instead. [Note:\nSulfonamides, such as cotrimoxazole, react with formaldehyde and must not be used concomitantly with\nmethenamine. The combination increases the risk of crystalluria and mutual antagonism.]\n1181\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1182 ---\n\nB.  Nitrofurantoin\nNitrofurantoin [NYE-troe-fue-RAN-toin] was introduced into clinical practice for the management of cystitis in the\nearly 1950s. For decades, it was rarely used, but was resurrected due to increasing antibiotic resistance among\nEnterobacteriaceae and is considered first-line therapy for uncomplicated cystitis. Nitrofurantoin works by inhibiting\nDNA and RNA synthesis. Susceptible organisms include E. coli, Klebsiella  spp., Enterococcus  spp., and\nStaphylococcus  spp. Following oral administration, it is rapidly absorbed, with nearly 40% excreted unchanged in\nthe urine. Overall, nitrofurantoin is well tolerated. Common adverse events include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\nUse of the microcrystalline formulation decreases the incidence of gastrointestinal toxicity. Rare complications of\ntherapy include pulmonary fibrosis, neuropathy, and autoimmune hepatitis. These events are observed with\nprolonged exposure greater than 1 month. Additionally, patients with impaired renal function should not receive\nnitrofurantoin due to an increased risk of adverse events.\n1182\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1183 ---\n\n31.1\n31.2\n31.3\n31.4\n31.5\n31.6Study Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nA 32-year-old man presents to an outpatient clinic with a 5-day history of productive cough, purulent\nsputum, and shortness of breath. He is diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). It is noted\nthat this patient has a severe ampicillin allergy (anaphylaxis). Which would be an acceptable treatment for\nthis patient?\nA.  Levofloxacin\nB.  Ciprofloxacin\nC.  Penicillin VK\nD.  Nitrofurantoin\nCorrect answer = A. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common cause of CAP, and the respiratory fluoroquinolones\nlevofloxacin and moxifloxacin provide good coverage. Ciprofloxacin does not cover S. pneumoniae  well and is a\npoor choice for treatment of CAP. Penicillin would be a poor choice due to allergy. Nitrofurantoin has no clinical\nutility for respiratory tract infections.\nA 22-year-old woman presents with a 2-day history of dysuria with increased urinary frequency and urgency.\nA urine culture and urinalysis are done. She is diagnosed with a urinary tract infection caused by E. coli.\nWhich agent should be avoided in the treatment of her UTI?\nA.  Levofloxacin\nB.  Cotrimoxazole\nC.  Moxifloxacin\nD.  Nitrofurantoin\nCorrect answer = C. Moxifloxacin does not concentrate in the urine and would be ineffective for treatment of a\nUTI. All other answers are viable alternatives, and the resistance profile for the E. coli can be utilized to direct\ntherapy.\nWhich drug is correctly matched with the appropriate adverse effect?\nA.  Levofloxacin—hyperkalemia\nB.  Nitrofurantoin—pulmonary fibrosis\nC.  Cotrimoxazole—hepatic encephalopathy\nD.  Methenamine—nystagmus\nCorrect answer = B. Hyperkalemia may be caused by cotrimoxazole, not fluoroquinolones. Hepatic\nencephalopathy may be related to therapy with methenamine in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Nystagmus is\nnot associated with methenamine therapy.\nCotrimoxazole provides activity against which organism?\nA.  MRSA\nB.  Pseudomonas aeruginosaC.  Anaerobes\nD.  Mycoplasma\nCorrect answer = A. Cotrimoxazole is effective against MRSA. It does not have activity against Pseudomonas ,\nanaerobes, or Mycoplasma .\nA 55-year-old man presents to primary care clinic with an erythematous and tender abscess on his left thigh.\nHe has a history of MRSA skin infections. Which is an appropriate antibiotic for empiric treatment?\nA.  Ciprofloxacin\nB.  Cotrimoxazole\nC.  Pyrimethamine\nD.  Cephalexin\nCorrect answer = B. Cotrimoxazole is the only agent with reliable activity against MRSA. Ciprofloxacin does\nhave some minor activity, but resistance has readily increased and it is no longer a valid recommendation. The\nother agents do not have activity against MRSA.\nWhich is a common adverse effect of cotrimoxazole?\nA.  Hyperkalemia\nB.  Pulmonary fibrosis\nC.  Tendon rupture\nD.  Blood glucose disturbances\nCorrect answer = A. Trimethoprim acts as a potassium-sparing agent, resulting in an increase in serum potassium\nconcentrations. Pulmonary fibrosis is an adverse effect of nitrofurantoin.

The nurse noted that\nthe patient recently took an antibiotic for community-acquired pneumonia. Which antibiotic may have\ncontributed to tendon rupture?\nA.  Amoxicillin/clavulanate\nB.  Cefdinir\nC.  Levofloxacin\nD.  Minocycline\nCorrect answer = C. Levofloxacin is associated with tendon ruptures and tendinopathy. The other agents are not\nassociated with this adverse effect.\nA 70-year-old woman with acute cystitis presents to the Family Medicine clinic for assessment. She has a\npast medical history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease. The team recommends initiation of\nnitrofurantoin for cystitis. After reviewing her antimicrobial therapy, which actions should be taken prior to\nclinic discharge?\nA.  Continue current therapy and counsel on gastrointestinal effects of nitrofurantoin.\nB.  Change nitrofurantoin to alternative agent due to chronic kidney disease.\nC.  Reduce nitrofurantoin dose due to impaired renal function.\nD.  Counsel patient regarding neuropathy associated with short-term therapy.\nCorrect answer = B. The key issue with the antibiotic recommendation is that nitrofurantoin should not be\nadministered in patients with poor kidney function. Adjusting the dose and continuing the current regimen are not\nacceptable modifications. Neuropathy is more common with therapy greater than 1 month.\nWhich recommendation should be provided to avoid phototoxicity associated with fluoroquinolone therapy?\nA.  Use sunscreen and avoid excessive exposure to UV light.\nB.  Take the medication at night to avoid high drug concentrations during the day.\nC.  Take with food.\nD.  Drink with 1 L of water per day to minimize drug buildup in skin tissue.\nCorrect answer = A. Patients taking a fluoroquinolone should apply sunscreen and take precautions to minimize\nrisk of phototoxicity. Adjusting the timing of the dose or taking with food or additional water does not change the\nrisk of an event.\nWhat is the main benefit for prescribing methenamine for treatment of a urinary tract infection?\nA.  Safe to use in patients with hepatic failure.\nB.  Available in intravenous and oral formulations.\nC.  Broad spectrum of activity.\nD.  Minimal development of resistance.\nCorrect answer = D. Methenamine does not select for resistance. Due to its conversion to formaldehyde, this\ncompound is the least likely compound to select for resistant isolates. Methenamine should be avoided in patients\nwith hepatic failure. This agent is only available as an oral formulation, and it has a narrow spectrum of activity.\n1184\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1185 ---\n\n32\nAntimycobacterial Drugs\nCharles A. Peloquin and Eric F. Egelund\n1185\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1186 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nMycobacteria are rod-shaped aerobic bacilli that multiply slowly, every 18 to 24 hours in vitro. Their cell walls\ncontain mycolic acids, which give the genus its name. Mycolic acids are long-chain, β-hydroxylated fatty acids.\nMycobacteria produce highly lipophilic cell walls that stain poorly with Gram stain. Once stained, the bacilli are not\ndecolorized easily by acidified organic solvents. Hence, the organisms are called “acid-fast bacilli.” Mycobacterial\ninfections classically result in the formation of slow-growing, granulomatous lesions that cause tissue destruction\nanywhere in the body.\nMycobacterium tuberculosis can cause latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and the disease known as\ntuberculosis (TB). [Note: In LTBI, the patient is infected with M. tuberculosis  without signs or symptoms of active\nTB disease.] TB is the leading infectious cause of death worldwide, and a quarter of the world’s population is\ninfected with TB. Increasing in frequency are diseases caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). These\nspecies include M. avium-intracellulare , M. chelonae, M . abscessus, M . kansasii, and M . fortuitum . Finally, M.\nleprae  causes leprosy.\nTB treatment generally includes four first-line drugs (Figure 32.1). Second-line drugs are typically less effective,\nmore toxic, and less extensively studied. They are used for patients who cannot tolerate the first-line drugs or who\nare infected with resistant TB. No drugs are specifically developed for NTM infections. Macrolides, rifamycins, and\naminoglycosides are frequently included, but NTM regimens vary widely by organism.\nFigure 32.1 Summary of drugs used to treat mycobacterial infections.\n1186\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1187 ---\n\n1187\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1188 ---\n\nII.  Chemotherapy for Tuberculosis\nM. tuberculosis  is slow growing and requires treatment for months to years. LTBI can be treated for 9 months with\nisoniazid (INH) monotherapy or with 12 once-weekly higher doses of INH and rifapentine. In contrast, active TB\ndisease must be treated with several drugs. Treatment for drug-susceptible TB lasts for at least 6 months, while\ntreatment of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) typically lasts for about 2 years.\n1188\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1189 ---\n\nA.  Strategies for addressing drug resistance\nPopulations of M. tuberculosis  contain small numbers of organisms that are naturally resistant to a particular drug.\nUnder selective pressure from inadequate treatment, especially from monotherapy, these resistant organisms can\nemerge as the dominant population. Figure 32.2 shows that resistance develops rapidly in TB patients given only\nstreptomycin. Multidrug therapy is employed to suppress these resistant organisms. The first-line drugs isoniazid,\nrifampin, ethambutol , and pyrazinamide are preferred because of their high efficacy and acceptable incidence of\ntoxicity. Rifabutin or rifapentine may replace rifampin under certain circumstances. Active disease always requires\ntreatment with multidrug regimens, and preferably three or more drugs with proven in vitro activity against the\nisolate. Although clinical improvement can occur in the first several weeks of treatment, therapy is continued much\nlonger to eradicate persistent organisms and to prevent relapse.\nFigure 32.2 Cumulative percentage of strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis  showing\nresistance to streptomycin.\nStandard short-course chemotherapy for tuberculosis includes isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol , and pyrazinamide for\n2 months (the intensive phase), followed by isoniazid and rifampin for 4 months (the continuation phase; Figure\n32.3). Once susceptibility data are available, the drug regimen can be individually tailored. Second-line regimens for\nMDR-TB (TB resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin) normally include an aminoglycoside (streptomycin,\nkanamycin, or amikacin) or capreomycin (all injectable agents), a fluoroquinolone (typically levofloxacin or\nmoxifloxacin), any first-line drugs that remain active, and one or more of the following: cycloserine, ethionamide, or\np-aminosalicylic acid. For extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB), other drugs such as clofazimine and linezolid\nmay be employed empirically.\n1189\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1190 ---\n\nFigure 32.3 One of several recommended multidrug schedules for the treatment of\ntuberculosis.\nPatient adherence can be low when multidrug regimens last for 6 months or longer. One successful strategy for\nachieving better treatment completion rates is directly observed therapy (DOT). Patients take the medications under\nobservation of a member of the health care team. DOT decreases drug resistance and improves cure rates. Most\npublic health departments offer DOT services.\n1190\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1191 ---\n\nB.  Isoniazid\nIsoniazid [eye-so-NYE-a-zid], along with rifampin, is one of the two most important TB drugs.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nIsoniazid is a prodrug activated by a mycobacterial catalase–peroxidase (KatG). Isoniazid targets the enzymes acyl\ncarrier protein reductase (InhA) and β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase (KasA), which are essential for the synthesis of\nmycolic acid. Inhibiting mycolic acid leads to a disruption in the bacterial cell wall.\n2.  Antibacterial spectrum\nIsoniazid is specific for treatment of M. tuberculosis , although M. kansasii  may be susceptible at higher drug\nconcentrations. Most NTM are resistant to INH. The drug is particularly effective against rapidly growing bacilli and\nis also active against intracellular organisms.\n3.  Resistance\nResistance follows chromosomal mutations, including 1) mutation or deletion of KatG (producing mutants incapable\nof prodrug activation), 2) varying mutations of the acyl carrier proteins, or 3) overexpression of the target enzyme\nInhA. Cross-resistance may occur between isoniazid and ethionamide.\n4.  Pharmacokinetics\nIsoniazid is readily absorbed after oral administration. Absorption is impaired if isoniazid is taken with food,\nparticularly high-fat meals. The drug diffuses into all body fluids, cells, and caseous material (necrotic tissue\nresembling cheese that is produced in tuberculous lesions). Drug concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are\nsimilar to those in the serum. Isoniazid undergoes N-acetylation and hydrolysis, resulting in inactive products.\nIsoniazid acetylation is genetically regulated, with fast acetylators exhibiting a 90-minute serum half-life, as\ncompared with 3 to 4 hours for slow acetylators (Figure 32.4). Excretion is through glomerular filtration and\nsecretion, predominantly as metabolites (Figure 32.5). Slow acetylators excrete more of the parent compound.\nFigure 32.4 Bimodal distribution of isoniazid half-lives caused by rapid and slow\nacetylation of the drug.\n1191\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1192 ---\n\nFigure 32.5 Administration and fate of isoniazid.\n5.  Adverse effects\nHepatitis is the most serious adverse effect associated with isoniazid. If hepatitis goes unrecognized, and if isoniazid\nis continued, it can be fatal. The incidence increases with age (greater than 35 years old), among patients who also\ntake rifampin, or among those who drink alcohol daily. Peripheral neuropathy, manifesting as paresthesia of the\nhands and feet, appears to be due to a relative pyridoxine deficiency caused by isoniazid. This can be avoided by\ndaily supplementation of pyridoxine (vitamin B6). Central nervous system (CNS) adverse effects can occur,\nincluding convulsions in patients prone to seizures. Hypersensitivity reactions with isoniazid include rashes and\nfever. Because isoniazid inhibits the metabolism of carbamazepine and phenytoin (Figure 32.6), isoniazid can\npotentiate the adverse effects of these drugs (for example, nystagmus and ataxia).\nFigure 32.6 Isoniazid potentiates the adverse effects of phenytoin.\n1192\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1193 ---\n\n1193\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1194 ---\n\nC.  Rifamycins: rifampin, rifabutin, and rifapentine\nRifampin, rifabutin, and rifapentine are all considered rifamycins, a group of structurally similar macrocyclic\nantibiotics, which are first-line oral agents for tuberculosis.\n1.  Rifampin\nRifampin [ri-FAM-pin] has broader antimicrobial activity than isoniazid and can be used as part of treatment for\nseveral different bacterial infections. Because resistant strains rapidly emerge during monotherapy, it is never given\nas a single agent in the treatment of active tuberculosis.\na.  Mechanism of action\nRifampin blocks RNA transcription by interacting with the β subunit of mycobacterial DNA-dependent RNA\npolymerase.\nb.  Antimicrobial spectrum\nRifampin is bactericidal for both intracellular and extracellular mycobacteria, including M. tuberculosis , and NTM,\nsuch as M. kansasii  and Mycobacterium avium  complex (MAC). It is effective against many gram-positive and\ngram-negative organisms and is used prophylactically for individuals exposed to meningitis caused by meningococci\nor Haemophilus influenzae . Rifampin also is highly active against M. leprae .\nc.  Resistance\nResistance to rifampin is caused by mutations in the affinity of the bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene\nfor the drug.\nd.  Pharmacokinetics\nAbsorption is adequate after oral administration. Distribution of rifampin occurs to all body fluids and organs.\nConcentrations attained in the CSF are variable, often 10% to 20% of blood concentrations. The drug is taken up by\nthe liver and undergoes enterohepatic recycling. Rifampin can induce hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes and\ntransporters (see",

Rifabutin\nRifabutin [rif-a-BYOO-tin], a derivative of rifampin, is preferred for TB patients coinfected with the human\nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) who are receiving protease inhibitors or several of the nonnucleoside reverse\ntranscriptase inhibitors. Rifabutin is a less potent inducer (approximately 40% less) of cytochrome P450 enzymes,\nthus lessening drug interactions. Rifabutin has adverse effects similar to those of rifampin but can also cause uveitis,\nskin hyperpigmentation, and neutropenia.\n3.  Rifapentine\nRifapentine [rih-fa-PEN-teen] has a longer half-life than that of rifampin. In combination with isoniazid, rifapentine\nmay be used once weekly in patients with LTBI and in select HIV-negative patients with minimal pulmonary TB.\n1195\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1196 ---\n\n1196\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1197 ---\n\nD.  Pyrazinamide\nPyrazinamide [peer-a-ZIN-a-mide] is a synthetic, orally effective short-course agent used in combination with\nisoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol . The precise mechanism of action is unclear. Pyrazinamide must be\nenzymatically hydrolyzed by pyrazinamidase to pyrazinoic acid, which is the active form of the drug. Some resistant\nstrains lack the pyrazinamidase enzyme. Pyrazinamide is active against tuberculosis bacilli in acidic lesions and in\nmacrophages. The drug distributes throughout the body, penetrating the CSF. Pyrazinamide may contribute to liver\ntoxicity. Uric acid retention is common, but rarely precipitates a gouty attack. Most of the clinical benefit from\npyrazinamide occurs early in treatment. Therefore, this drug is usually discontinued after 2 months of a 6-month\nregimen.\n1197\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1198 ---\n\nE.  Ethambutol\nEthambutol  [e-THAM-byoo-tole] is bacteriostatic and specific for mycobacteria. Ethambutol  inhibits arabinosyl\ntransferase—an enzyme important for the synthesis of the mycobacterial cell wall. Ethambutol  is used in\ncombination with pyrazinamide, isoniazid, and rifampin pending culture and susceptibility data. [Note: Ethambutol\nmay be discontinued if the isolate is determined to be susceptible to isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide.]\nEthambutol  distributes well throughout the body. Penetration into the CNS is variable, and it is questionably\nadequate for tuberculous meningitis. Both the parent drug and its hepatic metabolites are primarily excreted in the\nurine. The most important adverse effect is optic neuritis, which results in diminished visual acuity and loss of\nability to discriminate between red and green. The risk of optic neuritis increases with higher doses and in patients\nwith renal impairment. Visual acuity and color discrimination should be tested prior to initiating therapy and\nperiodically thereafter. Uric acid excretion is decreased by ethambutol , and caution should be exercised in patients\nwith gout.\nFigure 32.9 summarizes some of the characteristics of first-line drugs.\nFigure 32.9 Some characteristics of first-line drugs used in treating tuberculosis.

Drugs for Leprosy\nLeprosy (or Hansen disease) is uncommon in the United States; however, worldwide, it is a much larger problem\n(Figure 32.11).

The\ndrug is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is distributed throughout the body, with high concentrations\nin the skin. The parent drug undergoes hepatic acetylation. Both parent drug and metabolites are eliminated in the\nurine. Adverse reactions include hemolysis (especially in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase\ndeficiency), methemoglobinemia, and peripheral neuropathy.\n1204\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1205 ---\n\nB.  Clofazimine\nClofazimine [kloe-FAZ-i-meen] is a phenazine dye. Its mechanism of action may involve binding to DNA, although\nalternative mechanisms have been proposed. Its redox properties may lead to the generation of cytotoxic oxygen\nradicals that are toxic to the bacteria. Clofazimine is bactericidal to M. leprae, and it has potentially useful activity\nagainst M. tuberculosis  and NTM. The drug is recommended by the World Health Organization as part of a shorter\nregimen (9 to 12 months) for MDR-TB. Following oral absorption, clofazimine accumulates in tissues, allowing\nintermittent therapy but does not enter the CNS. Patients typically develop a pink to brownish-black discoloration of\nthe skin and should be informed of this in advance. Eosinophilic and other forms of enteritis, sometimes requiring\nsurgery, have been reported. Clofazimine has some anti-inflammatory and anti-immune activities. Thus, erythema\nnodosum leprosum may not develop in patients treated with this drug.\n1205\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1206 ---\n\n32.1\n32.2\n32.3\n32.4\n32.5Study Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nA 22-year-old female intravenous drug user was admitted to the hospital with a 4-week history of cough and\nfever. A chest radiograph showed left upper lobe cavitary infiltrate. Cultures of sputum yielded M.\ntuberculosis  susceptible to all antimycobacterial drugs. The patient received self-administered isoniazid,\nrifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Two weeks following initiation of therapy, the patient is concerned\nthat her urine is a “funny-looking reddish color.” Which drug is the most likely cause?\nA.  Isoniazid\nB.  Rifampin\nC.  Pyrazinamide\nD.  Ethambutol\nCorrect answer = B. Rifampin (as well as rifabutin and rifapentine) and its metabolites may color urine, feces,\nsaliva, sputum, sweat, and tears a bright red-orange. Patients should be counseled that this is an adverse effect\nwhich is not harmful, but can stain clothes and contact lenses.\nA 32-year-old man has been on standard four-drug therapy for active pulmonary tuberculosis for the past 2\nmonths. He has no other comorbid conditions. At his regular clinic visit, he complains of a “pins and\nneedles” sensation in his feet. Which drug is most likely causing this?\nA.  Isoniazid\nB.  Rifampin\nC.  Pyrazinamide\nD.  Ethambutol\nCorrect answer = A. Standard four-drug therapy for active pulmonary tuberculosis includes isoniazid. Isoniazid\ncan cause peripheral neuropathy with symptoms including paresthesias, such as “pins and needles” and\nnumbness.\nA 32-year-old man who takes standard four-drug therapy for active pulmonary tuberculosis complains about\na “pins and needles” feeling in his feet. He is diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy. Which vitamin should\nhave been included in the regimen for this patient to reduce the risk of neuropathy?\nA.  Niacin\nB.  Pyridoxine\nC.  Thiamine\nD.  Ascorbic acid\nCorrect answer = B. Concurrent administration of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) prevents the neuropathic actions of\nisoniazid. The relative deficiency of pyridoxine appears to be due to the interference of isoniazid with its\nactivation and enhancement of the excretion of pyridoxine.\nA 23-year-old man was started on standard four-drug antimycobacterial therapy for treatment of active TB.\nHe has epilepsy, which is controlled with carbamazepine. He has had no seizures in 5 years; however, upon\nreturn to clinic at 1 month, he reports having two seizures since his last visit. Which drug may be the reason\nhis carbamazepine is less effective?\nA.  Isoniazid\nB.  Rifampin\nC.  Pyrazinamide\nD.  Ethambutol\nCorrect answer = B. Rifampin is a potent inducer of cytochrome P450–dependent drug-metabolizing enzymes\nand may reduce the concentration of carbamazepine. None of the other drugs listed induce cytochrome P450\nenzymes.\nA 26-year-old female HIV patient was recently diagnosed with active tuberculosis. Currently, she is on a\nstable HIV regimen consisting of two protease inhibitors and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.\nWhich is the most appropriate regimen for treatment of her tuberculosis?\nA.  Rifampin + isoniazid + pyrazinamide + ethambutol\nB.  Rifabutin + isoniazid + pyrazinamide + ethambutol\nC.  Rifapentine + isoniazid + pyrazinamide + ethambutol\nD.  Rifampin + moxifloxacin + pyrazinamide + ethambutol\nCorrect answer = B. Rifabutin is recommended in place of rifampin in patients coinfected with HIV, since it is a\nless potent inducer of CYP enzymes than rifampin. However, rifabutin is a CYP3A4 substrate and “bidirectional”\ninteractions may result. That is, other medications, such as the protease inhibitors, may affect the concentration of\nrifabutin, requiring dose adjustment of rifabutin or use of alternative HIV agents.1206\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1207 ---\n\n32.6\n32.7\n32.8\n32.9\n32.10A 28-year-old man with MDR-TB is receiving the following medications for treatment: pyrazinamide,\nethionamide, moxifloxacin, streptomycin, and para-aminosalicylic acid. Which drug in his regimen requires\nmonitoring for QT prolongation?\nA.  Pyrazinamide\nB.  Ethionamide\nC.  Moxifloxacin\nD.  Streptomycin\nCorrect answer = C. While rare, prolongation of the QT interval is associated with the fluoroquinolones. QT\ninterval prolongation is due to the blocking of voltage-gated potassium channels. Of the available quinolones,\nmoxifloxacin has the greatest risk. The risk may be minimized by avoiding coadministration of other medications,\nwhich may prolong the QT interval. The other agents are not associated with QT prolongation.\nA 46-year-old male patient with active tuberculosis is to be initiated on the four-drug regimen of isoniazid,\nrifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. The patient reports no other conditions except gout. Which pair of\nantituberculosis drugs has the potential to worsen his gout?\nA.  Rifampin and isoniazid\nB.  Ethambutol and pyrazinamide\nC.  Rifampin and ethambutol\nD.  Isoniazid and ethambutol\nCorrect answer = B. Ethambutol and especially pyrazinamide both may increase uric acid concentrations and\nhave the potential to precipitate gouty attacks. Pyrazinamide- and ethambutol-induced hyperuricemia may be\ncontrolled by use of antigout medications, such as xanthine oxidase inhibitors. Symptoms of gout must be\nmonitored closely.\nA 24-year-old man returns to the clinic 1 month after starting treatment for tuberculosis. He is receiving\nisoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. He states that he feels fine, but now is having difficulty\nreading and feels he may need to get glasses. Which drug may be causing his decline in vision?\nA.  Isoniazid\nB.  Rifampin\nC.  Pyrazinamide\nD.  Ethambutol\nCorrect answer = D. Optic neuritis, exhibited as a decrease in visual acuity or loss of color discrimination, is the\nmost important side effect associated with ethambutol. Visual disturbances generally are dose related and more\ncommon in patients with reduced renal function. They are reversible (weeks to months) if ethambutol is\ndiscontinued promptly.\nA 36-year-old woman with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is being treated with the following agents:\nstreptomycin, cycloserine, pyrazinamide, ethionamide, and p-aminosalicylic acid. Her physician recently\nnoticed that she appears confused and anxious, and has a slight tremor. Which drug is most likely\ncontributing to her current state?\nA.  Streptomycin\nB.  Cycloserine\nC.  Pyrazinamide\nD.  Ethionamide\nCorrect answer = B. Cycloserine easily penetrates the CNS and may cause adverse effects involving the nervous\nsystem, including psychoses, drowsiness, tremor, paresthesia, aggression, and suicidal ideation, among others.\nPatients should be monitored continually for these signs and symptoms.\nWhich is correct regarding clofazimine in the treatment of leprosy?\nA.  Clofazimine should not be used in patients with a deficiency in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD).\nB.  Peripheral neuropathy is one of the most common adverse effects seen with the drug.\nC.  Clofazimine may cause skin discoloration over time.\nD.  The risk of erythema nodosum leprosum is increased in patients given clofazimine.\nCorrect answer = C. Clofazimine is a phenazine dye and causes bronzing (the skin pigment color will change\ncolor, from pink to brownish-black), especially in fair-skinned patients. This occurs in a majority of patients, and\ngenerally is not considered harmful but may take several months to years to fade after discontinuing the\nmedication.1207\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1208 ---\n\n1208\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1209 ---\n\n33\nAntifungal Drugs\nLindsey Childs-Kean\n1209\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1210 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nInfectious diseases caused by fungi are called mycoses, and they are often chronic in nature. Mycotic infections may\ninvolve only the skin (cutaneous mycoses extending into the epidermis), or may cause subcutaneous or systemic\ninfections. Unlike bacteria, fungi are eukaryotic, with rigid cell walls composed largely of chitin rather than\npeptidoglycan (a characteristic component of most bacterial cell walls). In addition, the fungal cell membrane\ncontains ergosterol rather than the cholesterol found in mammalian membranes. These structural characteristics are\nuseful targets for chemotherapeutic agents against mycoses. Fungi are generally resistant to antibiotics; conversely,\nbacteria are resistant to antifungal agents. The incidence of mycoses such as candidemia has been on the rise for the\nlast few decades. This is attributed to an increased number of patients with chronic immune suppression due to\norgan transplantation, cancer chemotherapy, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Simultaneously,\nnew therapeutic options have become available for the treatment of mycoses. Figure 33.1 summarizes clinically\nuseful agents for cutaneous and systemic mycoses. Figure 33.2 lists the common pathogenic organisms of the\nKingdom Fungi, and Figure 33.3 provides an overview of the mechanism of action of the various antifungal agents.\n1210\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1211 ---\n\nFigure 33.1 Summary of antifungal drugs.\n1211\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1212 ---\n\nFigure 33.2 Common pathogenic organisms of Kingdom Fungi.\nFigure 33.3 Cellular targets of antifungal drugs.\n1212\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1213 ---\n\nII.  Drugs for Subcutaneous and Systemic Mycotic Infections\n1213\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1214 ---\n\nA.  Amphotericin B\nAmphotericin [am-foe-TER-i-sin] B is a naturally occurring polyene antifungal produced by Streptomyces nodosus .\nIn spite of its toxic potential, amphotericin B  remains the drug of choice for the treatment of several life-threatening\nmycoses.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nAmphotericin B  binds to ergosterol in the plasma membranes of fungal cells. There, it forms pores (channels) that\nrequire hydrophobic interactions between the lipophilic segment of the polyene antifungal and the sterol (Figure\n33.4). The pores disrupt membrane function, allowing electrolytes (particularly potassium) and small molecules to\nleak from the cell, resulting in cell death.\nFigure 33.4 Model of a pore formed by amphotericin B in the lipid bilayer membrane.\n2.  Antifungal spectrum\nAmphotericin B  is either fungicidal or fungistatic, depending on the organism and the concentration of the drug. It is\neffective against a wide range of fungi, including Candida albicans , Histoplasma capsulatum , Cryptococcus\nneoformans , Coccidioides immitis , Blastomyces dermatitidis , and many strains of Aspergillus . [Note: Amphotericin\nB is also used in the treatment of the protozoal infection leishmaniasis.]\n3.  Resistance\nFungal resistance to amphotericin B , although infrequent, is associated with decreased ergosterol content of the\nfungal membrane.\n4.  Pharmacokinetics\nAmphotericin B  is administered by slow intravenous (IV) infusion (Figure 33.5). Amphotericin B  is insoluble in\nwater and must be coformulated with sodium deoxycholate (conventional) or artificial lipids to form liposomes. The\nliposomal preparations are associated with reduced renal and infusion toxicity but are more costly. Amphotericin B\nis extensively bound to plasma proteins and is distributed throughout the body. Inflammation favors penetration into\nvarious body fluids, but little of the drug is found in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), vitreous humor, peritoneal fluid,1214\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1215 ---\n\nor synovial fluid. Low levels of the drug and its metabolites are excreted primarily in the urine over a long period of\ntime.\nFigure 33.5 Administration and fate of amphotericin B. CSF = cerebrospinal fluid.\n5.  Adverse effects\nAmphotericin B  has a low therapeutic index. Toxic manifestations are outlined below (Figure 33.6).\n1215\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1216 ---\n\nFigure 33.6 Adverse effects of amphotericin B.\na.  Fever and chills\nThese occur most commonly 1 to 3 hours after starting the IV administration but usually subside with repeated\nadministration of the drug. Premedication with a corticosteroid or an antipyretic helps to prevent this problem.\nb.  Renal impairment\n1216\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1217 ---\n\nDespite the low levels of the drug excreted in the urine, patients may exhibit a decrease in glomerular filtration rate\nand renal tubular function. Serum creatinine may increase, creatinine clearance can decrease, and potassium and\nmagnesium are lost. Renal function usually returns with discontinuation of the drug, but residual damage is likely at\nhigh doses. Azotemia is exacerbated by other nephrotoxic drugs, such as aminoglycosides, cyclosporine, and\nvancomycin, although adequate hydration can decrease its severity. Sodium loading with infusions of normal saline\nprior to administration of the conventional formulation or use of the liposomal amphotericin B  products minimizes\nthe risk of nephrotoxicity.\nc.  Hypotension\nA shock-like fall in blood pressure accompanied by hypokalemia may occur, requiring potassium supplementation.\nCare must be exercised in patients taking digoxin and other drugs that can cause potassium fluctuations.\nd.  Thrombophlebitis\nAdding heparin to the infusion can alleviate this problem.\n1217\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1218 ---\n\nB.  Antimetabolite antifungals\nFlucytosine [floo-SYE-toe-seen] (5-FC) is a synthetic pyrimidine antimetabolite that is often used in combination\nwith other antifungal agents.\n1.  Mechanism of action\n5-FC  enters the fungal cell via a cytosine-specific permease, an enzyme not found in mammalian cells. It is\nsubsequently converted to a series of compounds, including 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine 5′-\nmonophosphate, which disrupt nucleic acid and protein synthesis (Figure 33.7). [Note: Amphotericin B  increases cell\npermeability, allowing more 5-FC  to penetrate the cell leading to synergistic effects.]\n1218\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1219 ---\n\nFigure 33.7 Mode of action of flucytosine. 5-FdUMP = 5-fluorodeoxyuridine 5′-\nmonophosphate; dTMP = deoxythymidine 5′-monophosphate.\n1219\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1220 ---\n\n2.  Antifungal spectrum\n5-FC  is fungistatic. It is effective in combination with itraconazole for treating chromoblastomycosis. It is also used\nin combination with amphotericin B  for the treatment of systemic mycoses and for meningitis caused by C.\nneoformans  and C. albicans . Flucytosine can also be used for Candida  urinary tract infections when fluconazole is\nnot appropriate; however, resistance can occur with repeated use.\n3.  Resistance\nResistance may occur due to decreased levels of any of the enzymes in the conversion of 5-FC  to 5-FU and other\nmetabolites. The emergence of resistant fungal cells is lower with a combination of 5-FC  plus a second antifungal\nagent. Thus, 5-FC  is not used as a single antimycotic drug.\n4.  Pharmacokinetics\n5-FC  is well absorbed after oral administration. It distributes throughout the body water and penetrates well into the\nCSF. 5-FU is detectable in patients and is probably the result of metabolism of 5-FC  by intestinal bacteria. Excretion\nof both the parent drug and metabolites is via glomerular filtration, and the dose must be adjusted in patients with\ncompromised renal function.\n5.  Adverse effects\n5-FC  causes reversible neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and dose-related bone marrow depression. Reversible\nhepatic dysfunction with elevation of serum transaminases has been observed. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are\ncommon, and severe enterocolitis may occur.\n1220\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1221 ---\n\nC.  Azole antifungals\nAzole antifungals are made up of two different classes of drugs—imidazoles and triazoles. Although these drugs\nhave similar mechanisms of action and spectra of activity, their pharmacokinetics and therapeutic uses vary\nsignificantly. In general, imidazoles are applied topically for cutaneous infections, whereas triazoles are\nadministered systemically for the treatment or prophylaxis of cutaneous and systemic mycoses. [Note: Imidazole\nantifungals are discussed in the section on agents for cutaneous mycotic infections.] The systemic triazole\nantifungals include fluconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, and isavuconazole.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nAzoles are predominantly fungistatic. They inhibit 14-α demethylase (a cytochrome P450 [CYP450] enzyme),\nthereby blocking the demethylation of lanosterol to ergosterol (Figure 33.8). The inhibition of ergosterol\nbiosynthesis disrupts fungal membrane structure and function, which, in turn, inhibits fungal cell growth.\nFigure 33.8 Mode of action of azole antifungals.\n2.  Resistance\nResistance to azole antifungals is becoming a significant clinical problem, particularly with protracted therapy\nrequired in immunocompromised patients, such as those who have advanced HIV infection or bone marrow\ntransplant. Mechanisms of resistance include mutations in the 14-α demethylase gene that lead to decreased azole\nbinding and efficacy. Additionally, some strains of fungi develop efflux pumps that pump the drug out of the cell or\nhave reduced ergosterol in the cell wall.\n3.  Drug interactions\nAll azoles inhibit the hepatic CYP450 3A4 isoenzyme to varying degrees. Patients on concomitant medications that\nare substrates for this isoenzyme may have increased concentrations and risk for toxicity. Several azoles, including\nitraconazole and voriconazole, are metabolized by CYP450 3A4 and other CYP450 isoenzymes. Therefore,\nconcomitant use of potent CYP450 inhibitors (for example, ritonavir) and inducers (for example, rifampin,\nphenytoin) can lead to increased adverse effects or clinical failure of these azoles, respectively.\n4.  Contraindications\nAzoles are considered teratogenic, and they should be avoided in pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs\nthe risk to the fetus.\n1221\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1222 ---\n\n1222\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1223 ---\n\nD.  Fluconazole\nFluconazole [floo-KON-a-zole] was the first triazole antifungal agent. It is the least active of all triazoles, with most\nof its spectrum limited to yeasts and some dimorphic fungi. It has no role in the treatment of aspergillosis or\nzygomycosis. It is highly active against Cryptococcus neoformans and certain species of Candida , including C.\nalbicans  and C. parapsilosis . Resistance is a concern, however, with other species, including C. krusei  and C.\nglabrata . Fluconazole is used for prophylaxis against invasive fungal infections in recipients of bone marrow\ntransplants. It is the drug of choice for Cryptococcus neoformans  after induction therapy with amphotericin B  and\nflucytosine and is used for the treatment of candidemia and coccidioidomycosis. Fluconazole is effective against\nmost forms of mucocutaneous candidiasis. It is commonly used as a single-dose oral treatment for vulvovaginal\ncandidiasis. Fluconazole is available in oral and IV dosage formulations. It is well absorbed after oral administration\nand distributes widely to body fluids and tissues. The majority of the drug is excreted unchanged via the urine, and\ndoses must be reduced in patients with renal dysfunction. The most common adverse effects with fluconazole are\nnausea, vomiting, headache, and skin rashes.\n1223\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1224 ---\n\nE.  Itraconazole\nItraconazole [it-ra-KON-a-zole] is a synthetic triazole that has a broad antifungal spectrum compared to fluconazole.\nItraconazole is a drug of choice for the treatment of blastomycosis, sporotrichosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, and\nhistoplasmosis. It is rarely used for treatment of infections due to Candida  and Aspergillus  species because of the\navailability of more effective agents. Itraconazole is available as a capsule, tablet, or oral solution. The capsule and\ntablet should be taken with food, and ideally an acidic beverage, to increase absorption. By contrast, the solution\nshould be taken on an empty stomach, as food decreases the absorption. The drug distributes well in most tissues,\nincluding bone and adipose tissues. Itraconazole is extensively metabolized by the liver, and the drug and inactive\nmetabolites are excreted in the urine and feces. Adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, rash (especially in\nimmunocompromised patients), hypokalemia, hypertension, edema, and headache. Liver toxicity can also occur,\nespecially when given with other hepatotoxic drugs. Itraconazole has a negative inotropic effect and should be\navoided in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction, such as heart failure.\n1224\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1225 ---\n\nF.  Posaconazole\nPosaconazole [poe-sa-KONE-a-zole], a synthetic triazole, is a broad-spectrum antifungal structurally similar to\nitraconazole. It is available as an oral suspension, oral tablet, or IV formulation. Posaconazole is commonly used for\nthe treatment and prophylaxis of invasive Candida  and Aspergillus  infections in severely immunocompromised\npatients. Because of its broad spectrum of activity, posaconazole is used in the treatment of invasive fungal\ninfections caused by Scedosporium  and Zygomycetes . The drug has low oral bioavailability and should be given\nwith food. Unlike other azoles, posaconazole is not metabolized by CYP450, but is eliminated via glucuronidation.\nDrugs that increase gastric pH (for example, proton pump inhibitors) may decrease the absorption of oral\nposaconazole and should be avoided if possible. Due to its potent inhibition of CYP450 3A4, concomitant use of\nposaconazole with a number of agents (for example, ergot alkaloids, atorvastatin, citalopram, and risperidone) is\ncontraindicated.\n1225\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1226 ---\n\nG.  Voriconazole\nVoriconazole [vor-i-KON-a-zole], a synthetic triazole related to fluconazole, is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent\nthat is available in both IV and oral dosage forms. Voriconazole has replaced amphotericin B  as the drug of choice\nfor invasive aspergillosis. It is also approved for treatment of invasive candidiasis, as well as serious infections\ncaused by Scedosporium  and Fusarium  species. Voriconazole has high oral bioavailability and penetrates into tissues\nwell. It is extensively metabolized by CYP450 2C19, 2C9, and 3A4 isoenzymes, and the metabolites are primarily\nexcreted via the urine. Inhibitors and inducers of these isoenzymes may impact levels of voriconazole, leading to\ntoxicity or clinical failure, respectively. Voriconazole displays nonlinear kinetics, which can be affected by drug\ninteractions and pharmacogenetic variability, particularly CYP450 2C19 polymorphisms. High trough\nconcentrations have been associated with visual and auditory hallucinations and an increased incidence of\nhepatotoxicity. Voriconazole is also an inhibitor of CYP2C19, 2C9, and 3A4 isoenzymes. Drugs that are substrates\nof these isoenzymes are impacted by voriconazole (Figure 33.9). Because of significant interactions, use of\nvoriconazole is contraindicated with many drugs (for example, rifampin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, and St. John’s\nwort).\nFigure 33.9 By inhibiting cytochrome P450, voriconazole can potentiate the toxicities of\nother drugs.\n1226\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1227 ---\n\nH.  Isavuconazole\nIsavuconazole [eye-sa-voo-KON-a-zole] is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent, which is supplied as the prodrug\nisavuconazonium in IV and oral dosage forms. Isavuconazonium is rapidly hydrolyzed by esterases in the blood to\nisavuconazole. Isavuconazole has a spectrum of activity similar to voriconazole and is approved for invasive\naspergillosis and invasive mucormycosis. Isavuconazonium has high bioavailability after oral administration and\ndistributes well into tissues. The drug is metabolized by CYP450 3A4/5 and uridine diphosphate-\nglucuronosyltransferases. Coadministration of isavuconazole with potent CYP450 3A4 inhibitors and inducers is\ncontraindicated. Isavuconazole is also an inhibitor of the CYP450 3A4 isoenzyme, thereby increasing the\nconcentrations of drugs that are substrates of CYP450 3A4. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and hypokalemia are\ncommon adverse effects.\nFigures 33.10 and 33.11 summarize the azole antifungal agents.\nFigure 33.10 Summary of triazole antifungals. CSF = cerebrospinal fluid; TDM =\ntherapeutic drug monitoring.\n1227\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1228 ---\n\nFigure 33.11 Major or life-threatening drug interactions of azole drugs. ↑ indicates\nincreased; ↓ indicates decreased. *Where an interaction has been reported for one\ntriazole, the contraindication has been extended to all others.\n1228\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1229 ---\n\nI.  Echinocandins\nEchinocandins interfere with the synthesis of the fungal cell wall by inhibiting the synthesis of β(1,3)-D-glucan,\nleading to lysis and cell death. Caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin are available for IV administration once\ndaily. Micafungin is the only echinocandin that does not require a loading dose. The echinocandins have potent\nactivity against Aspergillus  and most Candida  species, including those species resistant to azoles. However, they\nhave minimal activity against other fungi. The most common adverse effects are fever, rash, nausea, and phlebitis at\nthe infusion site. They should be administered via a slow IV infusion, as they can cause a histamine-like reaction\n(flushing) when infused rapidly.\n1.  Caspofungin\nCaspofungin [kas-poh-FUN-jin] is a first-line option for patients with invasive candidiasis, including candidemia,\nand a second-line option for invasive aspergillosis in patients who have failed or cannot tolerate amphotericin B  or\nan azole. The dose of caspofungin should be adjusted with moderate hepatic dysfunction. Concomitant\nadministration of caspofungin with CYP450 enzyme inducers (for example, rifampin) may require an increase in\ncaspofungin dose. Caspofungin should not be coadministered with cyclosporine due to a high incidence of elevated\nhepatic transaminases with concurrent use.\n2.  Micafungin and anidulafungin\nMicafungin [mi-ka-FUN-jin] and anidulafungin [ay-nid-yoo-la-FUN-jin] are first-line options for the treatment of\ninvasive candidiasis, including candidemia. Micafungin is also indicated for the prophylaxis of invasive Candidainfections in patients who are undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. These agents are not substrates\nfor CYP450 enzymes and do not have any associated drug interactions.\n1229\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1230 ---\n\nIII.  Drugs for Cutaneous Mycotic Infections\nMold-like fungi that cause cutaneous infections are called dermatophytes or tinea. Tinea infections are classified by\nthe affected site (for example, tinea pedis, which refers to an infection of the feet). Common dermatomycoses, such\nas tinea infections that appear as rings or round red patches with clear centers, are often referred to as “ringworm.”\nThis is a misnomer because fungi rather than worms cause the disease. The three different fungi that cause the\nmajority of cutaneous infections are Trichophyton, Microsporum , and Epidermophyton . The drugs used in the\ntreatment of cutaneous mycoses are listed in Figure 33.1.\n1230\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1231 ---\n\nA.  Squalene epoxidase inhibitors\nThese agents act by inhibiting squalene epoxidase, thereby blocking the biosynthesis of ergosterol, an essential\ncomponent of the fungal cell membrane (Figure 33.12). Accumulation of toxic amounts of squalene results in\nincreased membrane permeability and death of the fungal cell.\nFigure 33.12 Mode of action of squalene epoxidase inhibitors.\n1.  Terbinafine\nOral terbinafine [TER-bin-a-feen] is the drug of choice for treating dermatophyte onychomycoses (fungal infections\nof nails). It is better tolerated, requires a shorter duration of therapy, and is more effective than either itraconazole or\ngriseofulvin for Trichophyton . Therapy is prolonged (usually about 3 months) but considerably shorter than that\nwith griseofulvin. Oral terbinafine may also be used for tinea capitis (infection of the scalp). [Note: Oral antifungal\ntherapy (griseofulvin, terbinafine, itraconazole) is needed for tinea capitis. Topical antifungals are ineffective.]\nTopical terbinafine (1% cream, gel or solution) is used to treat tinea pedis, tinea corporis (ringworm), tinea cruris\n(infection of the groin or “jock itch”), and tinea versicolor due to Malassezia furfur . Duration of treatment is usually\n1 week.\na.  Antifungal spectrum\nTerbinafine is active against Trichophyton . It may also be effective against Candida , Epidermophyton , and\nScopulariopsis , but the efficacy in treating clinical infections due to these pathogens has not been established.\nb.  Pharmacokinetics\nTerbinafine is available for oral and topical administration. The bioavailability after oral administration is only 40%\ndue to first-pass metabolism. Terbinafine is highly protein bound and is deposited in the skin, nails, and adipose\ntissue. A prolonged terminal half-life of 200 to 400 hours may reflect the slow release from these tissues. Oral\nterbinafine is extensively metabolized by several CYP450 isoenzymes and is excreted mainly via the urine (Figure\n33.13). The drug should be avoided in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment or hepatic dysfunction.\nTerbinafine is an inhibitor of the CYP450 2D6 isoenzyme, and concomitant use with substrates of CYP450 2D6\nmay result in an increased risk of adverse effects with those agents.\n1231\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1232 ---\n\nFigure 33.13 Administration and fate of terbinafine.\nc.  Adverse effects\nCommon adverse effects include diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, headache, and rash. Taste and visual disturbances have\nbeen reported, as well as elevations in serum hepatic transaminases.\n2.  Naftifine\nNaftifine [NAF-ti-feen] is active against Trichophyton , Microsporum , and Epidermophyton . Naftifine cream and gel\nare used for topical treatment of tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea pedis. Duration of treatment is usually 2 to 4\nweeks.\n3.  Butenafine\nButenafine [byoo-TEN-a-feen] is active against Trichophyton rubrum , Epidermophyton , and Malassezia . Like\nnaftifine, butenafine cream is used for topical treatment of tinea infections.\n1232\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1233 ---\n\nB.  Griseofulvin\nGriseofulvin [gris-ee-oh-FUL-vin] causes disruption of the mitotic spindle and inhibition of fungal mitosis ( Figure\n33.14). It has been largely replaced by oral terbinafine for the treatment of onychomycosis, although it is still used\nfor dermatophytosis of the scalp and hair. Griseofulvin is fungistatic and requires a long duration of treatment (for\nexample, 6 to 12 months for onychomycosis). Duration of therapy is dependent on the rate of replacement of healthy\nskin and nails. Ultrafine crystalline preparations are absorbed adequately from the gastrointestinal tract, and\nabsorption is enhanced by high-fat meals. The drug concentrates in skin, hair, nails, and adipose tissue. Griseofulvin\ninduces hepatic CYP450 activity, which increases the rate of metabolism of a number of drugs, including\nanticoagulants. The use of griseofulvin is contraindicated in pregnancy and patients with porphyria.\nFigure 33.14 Inhibition of mitosis by griseofulvin.\n1233\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1234 ---\n\nC.  Nystatin\nNystatin [nye-STAT-in] is a polyene antifungal, and its structure, chemistry, mechanism of action, and resistance\nprofile resemble those of amphotericin B. It is used for the treatment of cutaneous and oral Candida  infections. The\ndrug is negligibly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and it is not used parenterally due to systemic toxicity\n(acute infusion-related adverse effects and nephrotoxicity). It is administered as an oral agent (“swish and swallow”\nor “swish and spit”) for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis (thrush), intravaginally for vulvovaginal\ncandidiasis, or topically for cutaneous candidiasis.\n1234\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1235 ---\n\nD.

Fluconazole\nB.  Amphotericin B\nC.  Itraconazole\nD.  Posaconazole\nCorrect answer = B. Amphotericin B is the best choice since nephrotoxicity is commonly associated with this\nmedication. Although the dose of fluconazole must be adjusted for renal insufficiency, it is not associated with\ncausing nephrotoxicity. Itraconazole and posaconazole are metabolized by the liver and are not associated with\nnephrotoxicity.\nA 55-year-old woman presents to the hospital with shortness of breath, fever, and malaise. She has a history\nof breast cancer and is receiving chemotherapy. Her chest x-ray shows pneumonia, and respiratory cultures\nare positive for Aspergillus fumigatus. Which is the MOST appropriate choice for treatment?\nA.  Voriconazole\nB.  Fluconazole\nC.  Flucytosine\nD.  Ketoconazole\nCorrect answer = A. Voriconazole is the drug of choice for aspergillosis. Studies have found it to be superior to\nother regimens including amphotericin B. Fluconazole, flucytosine, and ketoconazole do not have reliable in vitro\nactivity and are therefore not recommended.\nWhich antifungal agent should be avoided in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction?\nA.  Micafungin\nB.  Itraconazole\nC.  Terbinafine\nD.  Posaconazole\nCorrect answer = B. There is a black box warning that warns against the use of itraconazole in patients with\nevidence of ventricular dysfunction, including patients with heart failure.\nA 56-year-old woman with diabetes complains of thickening of the nail of the right big toe and a change in\ncolor (yellow).

Overview\nViruses are obligate intracellular parasites. They lack both a cell wall and a cell membrane, and they do not carry out\nmetabolic processes. Viruses use much of the metabolic machinery of the host, and few drugs are selective enough\nto prevent viral replication without injury to the infected host cells. Therapy for viral diseases is further complicated\nby the fact that clinical symptoms appear late in the course of the disease, at a time when most of the virus particles\nhave replicated. At this stage of viral infection, administration of drugs that block viral replication has limited\neffectiveness in many cases. However, a few virus groups respond to available antiviral drugs, and some antiviral\nagents are useful as prophylactic agents. These agents are discussed in this chapter. To assist in the review of these\ndrugs, they are grouped according to the type of viral infection they target (Figure 34.1).\n1243\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1244 ---\n\n1244\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1245 ---\n\n1245\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1246 ---\n\nFigure 34.1 Summary of antiviral drugs. HIV = human immunodeficiency virus. *Part of\na fixed-dose combination. (Figure continues on next page)\n1246\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1247 ---\n\nII.  Treatment of Respiratory Viral Infections\nViral respiratory tract infections for which treatments exist include influenza A and B and respiratory syncytial virus\n(RSV). [Note: Immunization against influenza is the preferred approach. However, antiviral agents are used when\npatients are allergic to the vaccine or outbreaks occur.]\n1247\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1248 ---\n\nA.  Neuraminidase inhibitors\nThe neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir [os-el-TAM-i-veer] and zanamivir [za-NA-mi-veer] are effective against\nboth type A and type B influenza viruses. They do not interfere with the immune response to influenza vaccine.\nAdministered prior to exposure, neuraminidase inhibitors prevent infection and, when administered within 24 to 48\nhours after the onset of symptoms, they modestly decrease the intensity and duration of symptoms.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nInfluenza viruses employ a specific neuraminidase that is inserted into the host cell membrane for the purpose of\nreleasing newly formed virions. This enzyme is essential for the virus life cycle. Oseltamivir and zanamivir\nselectively inhibit neuraminidase, thereby preventing the release of new virions and their spread from cell to cell.\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\nOseltamivir is an orally active prodrug that is rapidly hydrolyzed by the liver to its active form. Zanamivir is not\nactive orally and is administered via inhalation. Both drugs are eliminated unchanged in the urine (Figure 34.2).\nFigure 34.2 Administration and fate of oseltamivir and zanamivir.\n3.  Adverse effects\nThe most common adverse effects of oseltamivir are gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort and nausea, which can be\nalleviated by taking the drug with food. Irritation of the respiratory tract occurs with zanamivir. It should be used\nwith caution in individuals with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, because bronchospasm may\noccur.\n4.  Resistance\nMutations of the neuraminidase enzyme have been identified in adults treated with either of the neuraminidase\ninhibitors. These mutants, however, are often less infective and virulent than the wild type.\n1248\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1249 ---\n\nB.  Adamantane antivirals\nThe therapeutic spectrum of the adamantane derivatives, amantadine [a-MAN-ta-deen] and rimantadine [ri-MAN-\nta-deen], is limited to influenza A infections. Due to widespread resistance, the adamantanes are not recommended\nin the United States for the treatment or prophylaxis of influenza A.\n1249\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1250 ---\n\nC.  Ribavirin\nRibavirin [rye-ba-VYE-rin], a synthetic guanosine analog, is effective against a broad spectrum of RNA and DNA\nviruses. For example, ribavirin is used in the treatment of immunosuppressed infants and young children with severe\nRSV infections. Ribavirin is also effective in chronic hepatitis C infections when used in combination with other\ndirect-acting antivirals (DAAs).\n1.  Mechanism of action\nRibavirin inhibits replication of RNA and DNA viruses. The drug is first phosphorylated to the 5′-phosphate\nderivatives. The major product ribavirin triphosphate exerts its antiviral action by inhibiting guanosine triphosphate\nformation, preventing viral messenger RNA (mRNA) capping, and blocking RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\nRibavirin is effective orally and by inhalation. An aerosol is used in the treatment of RSV infection. Absorption is\nincreased if the oral drug is taken with a fatty meal. The drug and its metabolites are eliminated in urine ( Figure\n34.3).\nFigure 34.3 Administration and fate of ribavirin.\n3.  Adverse effects\nAdverse effects of ribavirin include dose-dependent transient anemia. Elevated bilirubin has also been reported. The\naerosol may be safer, although respiratory function in infants can deteriorate quickly after initiation of aerosol\ntreatment. Therefore, monitoring is essential. Ribavirin is contraindicated in pregnancy (Figure 34.4).\n1250\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1251 ---\n\nFigure 34.4 Ribavirin causes teratogenic effects.\n1251\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1252 ---\n\nIII.  Treatment of Hepatic Viral Infections\nThe hepatitis viruses currently identified (A, B, C, D, and E) each have a pathogenesis, which specifically involves\nreplication in and destruction of hepatocytes. Of this group, hepatitis B (a DNA virus) and hepatitis C (an RNA\nvirus) are the most common causes of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma ( Figure 34.5) and\nare the only hepatic viral infections for which therapy is currently available. [Note: Hepatitis A is a commonly\nencountered infection caused by oral ingestion of the virus, but it is not a chronic disease.] Chronic hepatitis B may\nbe treated with peginterferon-α-2a [peg-in-ter-FEER-on AL-fa], which is injected subcutaneously once weekly. Oral\ntherapy for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) includes lamivudine [la-MIV-yoo-deen], adefovir [a-DEF-o-veer],\nentecavir [en-TEK-a-vir], and tenofovir [ten-OF-oh-vir] (see Section VIII for tenofovir). The preferred treatment for\nchronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a combination of DAAs, the selection of which is based on the hepatitis C\ngenotype. In certain cases, ribavirin is added to a DAA regimen to enhance virologic response. With the\nintroduction of new DAAs, pegylated interferon-α  is no longer commonly used in HCV, and it is not recommended\nin current guidelines due to inferior efficacy and poor tolerability.\nFigure 34.5 The prevalence of chronic hepatitis B and C in the United States.\n1252\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1253 ---\n\nIV.  Treatment of Hepatitis B\n1253\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1254 ---\n\nA.  Interferons\nInterferons are a family of naturally occurring, inducible glycoproteins that interfere with the ability of viruses to\ninfect cells. The interferons are synthesized by recombinant DNA technology. At least three types of interferons\nexist—α, β, and γ (Figure 34.6). In “pegylated” formulations, bis-monomethoxy polyethylene glycol has been\ncovalently attached to interferon-α  to increase the size of the molecule. The larger molecular size delays absorption\nfrom the injection site, lengthens the duration of action of the drug, and also decreases its clearance.\nFigure 34.6 Some approved indications for interferon.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nThe antiviral mechanism is incompletely understood. It appears to involve the induction of host cell enzymes that\ninhibit viral RNA translation, ultimately leading to the degradation of viral mRNA and tRNA.\n2.  Therapeutic uses\nPeginterferon alfa-2a is approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection. It is also indicated for the treatment of\nHCV in combination with other agents, although use is uncommon due to availability of more effective agents.\n3.  Adverse effects\nThese include flu-like symptoms, such as fever, chills, myalgias, arthralgias, and GI disturbances. Fatigue and\nmental depression are common. The principal dose-limiting toxicities are bone marrow suppression, severe fatigue\nand weight loss, neurotoxicity characterized by somnolence and behavioral disturbances, autoimmune disorders\nsuch as thyroiditis and, rarely, cardiovascular problems such as heart failure.\n1254\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1255 ---\n\nB.  Lamivudine\nThis cytosine analog is an inhibitor of both hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\nreverse transcriptases (RTs). Lamivudine must be phosphorylated by host cellular enzymes to the triphosphate\n(active) form. This compound competitively inhibits HBV RNA-dependent DNA polymerase. As with many\nnucleotide analogs, the intracellular half-life of the triphosphate is many hours longer than its plasma half-life. The\nrate of HBV resistance is high following long-term therapy with lamivudine and, therefore, lamivudine is no longer\nrecommended in current hepatitis B guidelines.\n1255\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1256 ---\n\nC.  Adefovir\nAdefovir is a nucleotide analog that is phosphorylated by cellular kinases to adefovir diphosphate, which is then\nincorporated into viral DNA. This leads to termination of chain elongation and prevents replication of HBV.\nAdefovir is administered once daily and is renally excreted via glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. As with\nother agents, discontinuation of adefovir may result in severe exacerbation of hepatitis. Nephrotoxicity may occur\nwith chronic use, and the drug should be used cautiously in patients with existing renal dysfunction. Adefovir is no\nlonger recommended in current hepatitis B guidelines due to lower efficacy compared to other agents.\n1256\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1257 ---\n\nD.  Entecavir\nEntecavir is a guanosine nucleoside analog for the treatment of HBV infection. Following intracellular\nphosphorylation to the triphosphate, it competes with the natural substrate, deoxyguanosine triphosphate, for viral\nRT. Entecavir is effective against lamivudine-resistant strains of HBV and is dosed once daily. The drug is primarily\nexcreted unchanged in the urine and dosage adjustments are needed in renal dysfunction. Concomitant use of drugs\nwith renal toxicity should be avoided.\n1257\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1258 ---\n\nV.  Treatment of Hepatitis C\nHepatitis C virus (HCV) enters the hepatocyte following interaction with cellular entry factors. Once inside the cell,\na viral genome is released from the nucleocapsid and an HCV polyprotein is translated using the internal ribosome\nentry site. The polyprotein is then cleaved by cellular and viral proteases to yield structural and nonstructural\nproteins. The core NS3 and NS5A proteins form the replication complex on lipid droplets and serve as a scaffold for\nRNA polymerase to replicate the viral genome, which is then packaged in envelope glycoproteins before\nnoncytolytic secretion of mature virions. Several direct-acting antiviral agents targeting the NS3/NS4A protease,\nNS5B polymerase, and NS5A involved in HCV replication and assembly are available.\nCombination therapy with DAAs is necessary to optimize HCV treatment response rates. Current combinations\nemploy multiple DAAs that target different stages of the HCV life cycle simultaneously ( Figure 34.7). With\ncombination therapy, the agents are collectively able to suppress both wild-type and drug-resistant viral populations.\nCertain combinations may have different efficacy based on the genotype of HCV. It is anticipated that additional\nagents will be available in the near future. For a summary of current guidelines and regimens recommended in\nspecific scenarios, see www.hcvguidelines.org.\nFigure 34.7 Combinations of direct-acting antiviral agents for treatment of hepatitis C\nvirus. HCV = hepatitis C virus.\n1258\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1259 ---\n\nA.  NS3/NS4A protease inhibitors\nThe viral NS3/NS4A serine protease is crucial for processing the single polyprotein encoded by HCV RNA into\nindividually active proteins, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B. Without these serine proteins, RNA replication does\nnot occur and the HCV life cycle is effectively disrupted. Paritaprevir [PAR-i-TAP-re-vir] (which requires ritonavir\n[rit-OH-na-vir] boosting), grazoprevir [graz-OH-pre-vir], voxilaprevir [VOX-i-LA-pre-vir], and glecaprevir [glec-\nA-pre-vir] are DAAs that inhibit the NS3/NS4A serine protease as their primary mechanism of action. [Note: HCV\nprotease inhibitors often have the ending “-previr.”] These drugs have a lower barrier to resistance than other agents,\nsuch as sofosbuvir. Use of HCV protease inhibitors presents significant potential for drug–drug interactions due to\ntheir metabolism by CYP3A enzymes. Adverse effects of NS3/NS4A protease inhibitors include rash, pruritus,\nnausea, fatigue, and anemia.\n1259\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1260 ---\n\nB.  NS5B polymerase inhibitors\nNS5B is the sole RNA polymerase responsible for HCV replication and is processed with other HCV proteins into\nan individual polypeptide by the viral NS3/NS4A serine protease. There are two types of NS5B RNA polymerase\ninhibitors—nucleoside/nucleotide analogues that compete for the enzyme active site and nonnucleoside analogues\nthat target allosteric sites. Sofosbuvir [soe-FOS-bue-vir] is currently the only NS5B nucleotide polymerase inhibitor\nfor the treatment of HCV infection, and dasabuvir [da-SAB-ue-vir] is the only nonnucleoside analogue. [Note:\nNS5B inhibitors often end in “-buvir.”] NS5B polymerase inhibitors are well tolerated with few adverse effects.\n1260\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1261 ---\n\nC.  NS5A replication complex inhibitors\nNS5A is a viral protein that is essential for HCV RNA replication and assembly. Its role in replication appears to be\nthe formation of a membranous web along with viral protein NS4B, and this web provides a platform for replication.\nThe currently available NS5A inhibitors include ledipasvir [le-DIP-as-vir], ombitasvir [om-BIT-as-vir], elbasvir\n[ELB-as-vir], velpatasvir [vel-PAT-as-vir], pibrentasvir [pi-BRENT-as-vir], and daclatasvir [dak-LAT-as-vir].\n[Note: NS5A inhibitors often in “-asvir.”] With the exception of daclatasvir, these agents are all coformulated with\nother direct-acting antivirals (see Figure 34.7). NS5A inhibitors have a number of clinically significant drug\ninteractions due to their metabolism by hepatic CYP450 isoenzymes and inhibition of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). For\nexample, daclatasvir is extensively metabolized via hepatic CYP3A4 enzymes, and the drug is contraindicated in\ncombination with strong CYP3A4 inducers because of the potential for reduced efficacy. In addition, the dose of\ndaclatasvir should be decreased when coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and increased when\ncoadministered with moderate CYP3A4 inducers. Absorption of ledipasvir is reduced when gastric pH is increased.\nPatients receiving proton pump inhibitors should either stop these agents during HCV therapy with ledipasvir or\ntake the proton pump inhibitor with ledipasvir-containing regimens under fasted conditions to ensure that gastric pH\nis at its lowest point at the time of drug administration.\n1261\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1262 ---\n\nD.  Ribavirin\nRibavirin is approved for the treatment of chronic HCV when used in combination with standard or pegylated\ninterferon or with DAAs. Ribavirin, a guanosine analogue, improves viral clearance, decreases relapse rates, and\nimproves rates of sustained virologic response when used in combination with other agents. The addition of\nribavirin to DAA-based regimens is based on HCV genotype/subtype, cirrhosis status, mutational status, and\ntreatment history. Despite its use in patients with HCV for more than 20 years, the precise mechanism(s) by which\nribavirin improves outcomes is unknown. Ribavirin remains an important component of HCV therapy, even in the\nage of DAA therapy. Whether use of ribavirin will be necessary with future DAAs is not known. The dose of\nribavirin is always weight-based, and it is administered in two daily divided doses with food.\n1262\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1263 ---\n\nVI.  Treatment of Herpes Virus Infections\nHerpes viruses are associated with a broad spectrum of diseases, for example, cold sores, viral encephalitis, and\ngenital infections. The drugs that are effective against these viruses exert their actions during the acute phase of viral\ninfections and are without effect during the latent phase.\n1263\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1264 ---\n\nA.  Acyclovir\nAcyclovir [ay-SYE-kloe-veer] is the prototypic antiherpetic therapeutic agent. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1\nand 2, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and some Epstein-Barr virus–mediated infections are sensitive to acyclovir. It is\nthe treatment of choice in HSV encephalitis. The most common use of acyclovir is in therapy for genital herpes\ninfections. It is also given prophylactically to seropositive patients before bone marrow transplant and post-heart\ntransplant to protect such individuals from herpetic infections.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nAcyclovir, a guanosine analog, is monophosphorylated in the cell by the herpesvirus-encoded enzyme thymidine\nkinase (Figure 34.8). Therefore, virus-infected cells are most susceptible. The monophosphate analog is converted to\nthe di- and triphosphate forms by the host cell kinases. Acyclovir triphosphate competes with deoxyguanosine\ntriphosphate as a substrate for viral DNA polymerase and is itself incorporated into the viral DNA, causing\npremature DNA chain termination.\n1264\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1265 ---\n\n1265\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1266 ---\n\nFigure 34.8 Incorporation of acyclovir into replicating viral DNA, causing chain\ntermination. dGTP = deoxyguanosine triphosphate.\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\nAcyclovir is administered by intravenous (IV), oral, or topical routes. [Note: The efficacy of topical applications is\nquestionable.] The drug distributes well throughout the body, including the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Acyclovir is\npartially metabolized to an inactive product. Excretion into the urine occurs both by glomerular filtration and tubular\nsecretion (Figure 34.9). Acyclovir accumulates in patients with renal failure. The valyl ester, valacyclovir [val-a-\nSYE-kloe-veer], has greater oral bioavailability than acyclovir. This ester is rapidly hydrolyzed to acyclovir and\nachieves levels of the latter comparable to those of acyclovir following IV administration.\nFigure 34.9 Administration and fate of acyclovir. IV = intravenous.\n3.  Adverse effects\nAdverse effects of acyclovir treatment depend on the route of administration. For example, local irritation may occur\nfrom topical application; headache, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting may result after oral administration. Transient\nrenal dysfunction may occur at high doses or in a dehydrated patient receiving the drug intravenously.\n4.  Resistance\nAltered or deficient thymidine kinase and DNA polymerases have been found in some resistant viral strains and are\nmost commonly isolated from immunocompromised patients. Cross-resistance to the other agents in this family\noccurs.\n1266\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1267 ---\n\nB.  Cidofovir\nCidofovir [si-DOE-foe-veer] is indicated for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in patients with\nAIDS. [Note: CMV is a member of the herpesvirus family.] Cidofovir is a nucleotide analog of cytosine, the\nphosphorylation of which is not dependent on viral or cellular enzymes. It inhibits viral DNA synthesis. Slow\nelimination of the active intracellular metabolite permits prolonged dosage intervals and eliminates the permanent\nvenous access needed for ganciclovir therapy. Cidofovir is administered intravenously. Cidofovir produces\nsignificant renal toxicity (Figure 34.10), and it is contraindicated in patients with preexisting renal impairment and in\nthose taking nephrotoxic drugs. Neutropenia and metabolic acidosis also occur. Oral probenecid and IV normal\nsaline are coadministered with cidofovir to reduce the risk of nephrotoxicity. Since the introduction of highly active\nantiretroviral therapy, the prevalence of CMV infections in immunocompromised hosts has markedly declined, as\nhas the importance of cidofovir in the treatment of these patients.\nFigure 34.10 Administration, fate, and toxicity of cidofovir. IV = intravenous.\n1267\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1268 ---\n\nC.  Foscarnet\nUnlike most antiviral agents, foscarnet  [fos-KAR-net] is not a purine or pyrimidine analog. Instead, it is a\npyrophosphate derivative and does not require activation by viral (or cellular) kinases. Foscarnet  is approved for\nCMV retinitis in immunocompromised hosts and for acyclovir-resistant HSV infections. Foscarnet  works by\nreversibly inhibiting viral DNA and RNA polymerases, thereby interfering with viral DNA and RNA synthesis.\nMutation of the polymerase structure is responsible for resistant viruses. Foscarnet  is poorly absorbed orally and\nmust be injected intravenously. It must also be given frequently to avoid relapse when plasma levels fall. It is\ndispersed throughout the body, and greater than 10% enters the bone matrix, from which it slowly disperses. The\nparent drug is eliminated by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion (Figure 34.11). Adverse effects include\nnephrotoxicity, anemia, nausea, and fever. Due to chelation with divalent cations, hypocalcemia and\nhypomagnesemia are also seen. In addition, hypokalemia, hypo- and hyperphosphatemia, seizures, and arrhythmias\nhave been reported.\nFigure 34.11 Administration and fate of foscarnet.\n1268\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1269 ---\n\nD.  Ganciclovir\nGanciclovir [gan-SYE-kloe-veer] is an analog of acyclovir that has greater activity against CMV. It is used for the\ntreatment of CMV retinitis in immunocompromised patients and for CMV prophylaxis in transplant patients.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nLike acyclovir, ganciclovir is activated through conversion to the nucleoside triphosphate by viral and cellular\nenzymes. The nucleotide inhibits viral DNA polymerase and can be incorporated into the DNA resulting in chain\ntermination.\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\nGanciclovir is administered IV and distributes throughout the body, including the CSF. Excretion into the urine\noccurs through glomerular filtration and tubular secretion ( Figure 34.12). Like acyclovir, ganciclovir accumulates in\npatients with renal failure. Valganciclovir [val-gan-SYE-kloe-veer], an oral drug, is the valyl ester of ganciclovir.\nLike valacyclovir, valganciclovir has high oral bioavailability, because rapid hydrolysis in the intestine and liver\nafter oral administration leads to high levels of ganciclovir.\nFigure 34.12 Administration and fate of ganciclovir.\n3.  Adverse effects\nAdverse effects include severe, dose-dependent neutropenia. Ganciclovir is carcinogenic as well as teratogenic and\ncarries a boxed warning for use in pregnancy.\n4.  Resistance\nResistant CMV strains have been detected that have lower levels of ganciclovir triphosphate.\n1269\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1270 ---\n\nE.  Penciclovir and famciclovir\nPenciclovir [pen-SYE-kloe-veer] is an acyclic guanosine nucleoside derivative that is active against HSV-1, HSV-2,\nand VZV. Penciclovir is administered topically (Figure 34.13). It is monophosphorylated by viral thymidine kinase,\nand cellular enzymes form the nucleoside triphosphate, which inhibits HSV DNA polymerase. Penciclovir\ntriphosphate has an intracellular half-life much longer than acyclovir triphosphate. Penciclovir is negligibly\nabsorbed upon topical application and is well tolerated. Famciclovir [fam-SYE-kloe-veer], another acyclic analog of\n2′-deoxyguanosine, is a prodrug that is metabolized to the active penciclovir. The antiviral spectrum is similar to that\nof ganciclovir, and it is approved for treatment of acute herpes zoster, genital HSV infection, and recurrent herpes\nlabialis. The drug is effective orally (Figure 34.13). Adverse effects include headache and nausea.\nFigure 34.13 Administration and fate of penciclovir and famciclovir.\n1270\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1271 ---\n\nF.  Trifluridine\nTrifluridine [trye-FLURE-i-deen] is a fluorinated pyrimidine nucleoside analog that is structurally similar to\nthymidine. Once converted to the triphosphate, the agent is believed to inhibit the incorporation of thymidine\ntriphosphate into viral DNA and, to a lesser extent, lead to the synthesis of defective DNA that renders the virus\nunable to replicate. Trifluridine is active against HSV-1, HSV-2, and vaccinia virus. It is indicated for treatment of\nHSV keratoconjunctivitis and recurrent epithelial keratitis. Because the triphosphate form of trifluridine can also\nincorporate to some degree into cellular DNA, the drug is too toxic for systemic use. Therefore, the use of\ntrifluridine is restricted to a topical ophthalmic preparation. A short half-life necessitates that the drug be applied\nfrequently. Adverse effects include a transient irritation of the eye and palpebral (eyelid) edema.\nFigure 34.14 summarizes selected antiviral agents.\nFigure 34.14 Summary of selected antiviral agents. RSV = respiratory syncytial virus.\n1271\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1272 ---\n\nVII.  Treatment of HIV Infection\nPrior to approval of zidovudine [zye-DOE-vyoo-deen] in 1987, treatment of HIV infections focused on decreasing\nthe occurrence of opportunistic infections that caused a high degree of morbidity and mortality in AIDS patients.\nToday, the viral life cycle is understood (Figure 34.15), and a combination of drugs is used to suppress replication of\nHIV and restore the number of CD4 cells and immunocompetence to the host. This multidrug regimen is commonly\nreferred to as antiretroviral therapy, or ART (Figure 34.16). There are five classes of antiretroviral drugs, each of\nwhich targets one of the four viral processes. These classes of drugs are nucleoside and nucleotide reverse\ntranscriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs),\nentry inhibitors, and the integrase inhibitors. There are also two pharmacokinetic enhancers, also known as\n“boosters,” which lack anti-HIV activity themselves, but rather serve to increase drug levels of concomitantly\nadministered antiretroviral agents and allow for less frequent dosing and less variation in drug levels. Initial therapy\nfor HIV consists of a combination of two NRTIs with an integrase inhibitor, an NNRTI, or a boosted PI. Selection of\nthe appropriate combination is based on 1) avoidance of the use of two agents of the same nucleoside analog; 2)\navoidance of overlapping toxicities and genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of the virus; 3) patient factors, such\nas disease symptoms and concurrent illnesses; 4) impact of drug interactions; and 5) ease of adherence to the\nregimen. The goals of therapy are to maximally and durably suppress HIV RNA replication, to restore and preserve\nimmunologic function, to reduce HIV-related morbidity and mortality, and to improve quality of life.\n1272\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1273 ---\n\n1273\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1274 ---\n\nFigure 34.15 Drugs used to prevent HIV from replicating.

NRTIs Used to Treat HIV Infection\n1277\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1278 ---\n\nA.  Overview of NRTIs\nNRTIs were the first agents available to treat HIV infection, and currently, the use of two NRTIs is a mainstay of\nmost initial antiretroviral regimens. Available NRTIs include zidovudine, lamivudine, emtricitabine [em-trye-SYE-\nta-been], tenofovir, didanosine [dye-DAN-oh-seen], stavudine [STA-vue-deen], and abacavir [a-BAK-a-veer]. The\nmost commonly used NRTIs are tenofovir, abacavir, emtricitabine, and lamivudine, and these NRTIs are\nrecommended parts of initial regimens for most patients with HIV. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in combination\nwith emtricitabine can also be used for preexposure prophylaxis in individuals at high risk for HIV acquisition.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nThese agents are inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase. NRTIs are analogs of native ribosides (nucleosides or\nnucleotides containing ribose), which all lack a 3′-hydroxyl group. Once they enter cells, they are phosphorylated by\ncellular enzymes to the corresponding triphosphate analog, which is preferentially incorporated into the viral DNA\nby RT. Because the 3′-hydroxyl group is not present, a 3′,5′-phosphodiester bond between an incoming nucleoside\ntriphosphate and the growing DNA chain cannot be formed, and DNA chain elongation is terminated. Affinities of\nthe drugs for many host cell DNA polymerases are lower than they are for HIV RT, although mitochondrial DNA\npolymerase γ appears to be susceptible at therapeutic concentrations.\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\nAll of the NRTIs are administered orally. [Note: Zidovudine is also available as an intravenous formulation.]\nTenofovir is available in two different salt forms as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and tenofovir alafenamide\n(TAF); both prodrugs of tenofovir. The tenofovir prodrug is converted by lymphoid cellular enzymes to tenofovir\ndiphosphate, which is the active form of the drug and an inhibitor of HIV RT. TAF achieves improved anti-HIV\nactivity at lower doses than TDF, resulting in a five- to sevenfold increase in intracellular diphosphate in the\nlymphoid cell and in lower circulating plasma tenofovir levels. Because of this, TAF has fewer adverse effects (renal\ninsufficiency and loss of bone mineral density) than TDF. The NRTIs are primarily renally excreted, and all require\ndosage adjustment in renal insufficiency except abacavir, which is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase and\nglucuronyl transferase.\n3.  Adverse effects\nMany toxicities of the NRTIs are believed to be due to inhibition of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase in certain\ntissues. As a general rule, the dideoxynucleosides, such as didanosine and stavudine, have a greater affinity for the\nmitochondrial DNA polymerase, leading to toxicities such as peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis, and lipoatrophy.\nBecause of these mitochondrial toxicities, didanosine and stavudine are rarely used in current antiretroviral\nregimens. When more than one NRTI is given, care is taken to avoid overlapping toxicities. All NRTIs have been\nassociated with potentially fatal liver toxicity characterized by lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis.\nAbacavir is associated with a hypersensitivity reaction, which affects approximately 5% of patients and is usually\ncharacterized by drug fever, plus a rash, GI symptoms, malaise, or respiratory distress (Figure 34.17). Sensitized\nindividuals should never be rechallenged with abacavir because of rapidly appearing, severe reactions that may lead\nto death. A genetic test (HLA-B*5701) is available to screen patients for the potential of this reaction. Figure 34.18\nshows some adverse reactions commonly seen with nucleoside analogs.\n1278\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1279 ---\n\nFigure 34.17 Hypersensitivity reactions to abacavir.\nFigure 34.18 Some adverse reactions of nucleoside analogs.\n4.  Drug interactions\nDue to the renal excretion of the NRTIs, there are not many drug interactions encountered with these agents except\nfor zidovudine and tenofovir.\n5.  Resistance\nNRTI resistance is well characterized, and the most common resistance pattern is a mutation at viral RT codon 184,\nwhich confers a high degree of resistance to lamivudine and emtricitabine but, more importantly, restores sensitivity\nto zidovudine and tenofovir. Because cross-resistance and antagonism occur between agents of the same analog class\n(thymidine, cytosine, guanosine, and adenosine), concomitant use of agents with the same analog target is\ncontraindicated (for example, zidovudine and stavudine are both analogs of thymidine and should not be used\ntogether).\n1279\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1280 ---\n\nIX.  NNRTIs Used to Treat HIV Infection\nNNRTIs are highly selective, noncompetitive inhibitors of HIV RT. They bind to HIV RT at an allosteric\nhydrophobic site adjacent to the active site, inducing a conformational change that results in enzyme inhibition.\nThey do not require activation by cellular enzymes. These drugs have common characteristics that include cross-\nresistance with other NNRTIs, drug interactions, and a high incidence of hypersensitivity reactions, including rash.\nThe NNRTIs include nevirapine [ne-VYE-ra-peen], delavirdine [de-LA-vir-deen], efavirenz [e-FA-veer-enz],\netravirine [et-ra-VYE-rine], and rilpivirine [ril-pi-VIR-een]. Efavirenz (Figure 34.19) and rilpivirine are\nrecommended in initial antiretroviral regimens in certain clinical situations. For example, efavirenz is safe to use in\npatients co-infected with tuberculosis because of its lower potential for drug interactions with rifamycins, and\nrilpivirine has the smallest tablet size, making it ideal for patients with difficulty swallowing. Etravirine is a second-\ngeneration NNRTI active against many HIV strains that are resistant to the first-generation NNRTIs; its use is\nlimited to HIV treatment–experienced, multidrug-resistant patients who have evidence of ongoing viral replication.\nDelavirdine and nevirapine are rarely used due to toxicities and/or inferior antiviral efficacy.\nFigure 34.19 Adverse reactions of efavirenz.\n1280\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1281 ---\n\nX.  Protease Inhibitors Used to Treat HIV Infection\nInhibitors of HIV protease have significantly altered the course of this devastating viral disease. Shortly after their\nintroduction, the number of deaths in the United States due to AIDS decreased and continues to remain on the\ndecline (Figure 34.20). Available PIs include atazanavir (ATV), darunavir (DRV) [da-ROON-a-veer],\nfosamprenavir (FPV) [FOS-am-PREN-a-veer], indinavir (IDV) [in-DIN-a-veer], lopinavir (LPV) [loe-PIN-a-vir],\nnelfinavir (NFV) [nel-FIN-a-veer], saquinavir (SQV) [sa-KWIN-a-veer], and tipranavir (TPV) [tip-RA-na-veer].\nHowever, current HIV guidelines only list a select few (for example, atazanavir or darunavir) due to improved\nadverse effect profile, virologic efficacy, and ease of dosing. Due to their high genetic barrier to resistance, protease\ninhibitors are recommended in initial regimens in certain clinical situations (for example, patients with uncertain\nadherence or when resistance testing results are not yet available).\nFigure 34.20 Estimated number of AIDS cases and deaths due to AIDS in the United\nStates. Green background indicates years in which combination antiretroviral therapy\ncame into common usage.\n1281\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1282 ---\n\nA.  Overview\nThese potent agents have several common features that characterize their pharmacology.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nDrugs in this group are reversible inhibitors of the HIV aspartyl protease (retropepsin), which is the viral enzyme\nresponsible for cleavage of the viral polyprotein into a number of essential enzymes (RT, protease, and integrase)\nand several structural proteins. The inhibition prevents maturation of the viral particles and results in the production\nof noninfectious virions.\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\nHigh-fat meals substantially increase the bioavailability of some PIs, such as nelfinavir and saquinavir, whereas the\nbioavailability of indinavir is decreased, and others are essentially unaffected. The HIV PIs are all substantially\nbound to plasma proteins. These agents are substrates for the CYP3A4 isoenzyme, and individual PIs are also\nmetabolized by other CYP450 isoenzymes. Metabolism is extensive, and very little drug is excreted unchanged in\nurine.\n3.  Adverse effects\nPIs commonly cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (Figure 34.21). Disturbances in glucose and lipid metabolism\nalso occur, including diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypercholesterolemia. Chronic administration results in fat\nredistribution, including loss of fat from the extremities, fat accumulation in the abdomen and the base of the neck\n(“buffalo hump”; Figure 34.22), and breast enlargement. These physical changes may indicate to others that an\nindividual is HIV infected.\n1282\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1283 ---\n\nFigure 34.21 Some adverse effects of the HIV protease inhibitors.\n1283\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1284 ---\n\nFigure 34.22 Accumulation of fat at the base of the neck in a patient receiving a protease\ninhibitor.\n4.  Drug interactions\nDrug interactions are a common problem for PIs, because they are substrates and also potent inhibitors of CYP450\nisoenzymes. Drugs that rely on metabolism for their termination of action may accumulate to toxic levels. Examples\nof potentially dangerous interactions with PIs include rhabdomyolysis from simvastatin or lovastatin, excessive\nsedation from midazolam or triazolam, and respiratory depression from fentanyl  (Figure 34.23). Other drug\ninteractions that require dosage modification and cautious use include warfarin, sildenafil, and phenytoin (Figure\n34.24). In addition, inducers of CYP450 isoenzymes may decrease PI plasma concentrations to suboptimal levels,\ncontributing to treatment failures. Thus, drugs such as rifampin and St. John's wort  are also contraindicated with PIs.\n1284\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1285 ---\n\nFigure 34.23 Drugs that should not be coadministered with any protease inhibitor.\n1285\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1286 ---\n\nFigure 34.24 Drugs that require dose modifications or cautious use with any protease\ninhibitor.\n5.  Resistance\nResistance occurs as an accumulation of stepwise mutations of the protease gene. Initial mutations result in\ndecreased ability of the virus to replicate, but as the mutations accumulate, virions with high levels of resistance to\nthe protease inhibitors emerge. Suboptimal concentrations of PI result in the more rapid appearance of resistant\nstrains.\n1286\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1287 ---\n\nB.  Atazanavir\nAtazanavir is well absorbed after oral administration. It must be taken with food to increase absorption and\nbioavailability. Atazanavir requires an acidic environment for absorption. Thus, unboosted atazanavir is\ncontraindicated with concurrent use of proton pump inhibitors, and administration must be spaced apart from H2-\nblockers and antacids. Atazanavir can be boosted by ritonavir or cobicistat . The drug is highly protein bound and\nundergoes extensive metabolism by CYP3A4 isoenzymes. It is excreted primarily in bile. It has a half-life of about 7\nhours, but it may be administered once daily. Atazanavir is a competitive inhibitor of glucuronyl transferase, and\nbenign hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice are known adverse effects. In addition, the drug may prolong the PR\ninterval. Atazanavir exhibits a decreased risk of hyperlipidemia compared with other PIs.\n1287\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1288 ---\n\nC.  Darunavir\nDarunavir [da-RU-na-veer] is coadministered with cobicistat  or a low dose of ritonavir. Darunavir is approved for\ninitial therapy in treatment-naive HIV-infected patients, as well as for treatment-experienced patients with HIV\nresistant to other PIs. Darunavir must be taken with food to increase absorption. The elimination half-life is 15\nhours when combined with ritonavir. Darunavir is extensively metabolized by the CYP3A enzymes and is also an\ninhibitor of the CYP3A4 isoenzyme. Adverse effects are similar to those of the other PIs. In addition, darunavir\ntherapy has been associated with a rash.\nA summary of PIs is presented in Figure 34.25.\n1288\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1289 ---\n\n1289\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1290 ---\n\nFigure 34.25 Summary of protease inhibitors. [Note: Lopinavir is coformulated with\nritonavir. Ritonavir inhibits the metabolism of lopinavir, thereby increasing its level in\nthe plasma.]\n1290\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1291 ---\n\nXI.  Entry Inhibitors\n1291\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1292 ---\n\nA.  Enfuvirtide\nEnfuvirtide [en-FYOO-vir-tide] is a fusion inhibitor. For HIV to gain entry into the host cell, it must fuse its\nmembrane with that of the host cell. This is accomplished by changes in the conformation of the viral\ntransmembrane glycoprotein gp41, which occurs when HIV binds to the host cell surface. Enfuvirtide is a\npolypeptide that binds to gp41, preventing the conformational change. Enfuvirtide, in combination with other\nantiretroviral agents, is indicated for therapy of treatment-experienced patients with evidence of viral replication\ndespite ongoing antiretroviral drug therapy. As a peptide, it must be given subcutaneously. Most of the adverse\neffects are related to the injection, including pain, erythema, induration, and nodules, which occur in almost all\npatients. Enfuvirtide must be reconstituted prior to administration.\n1292\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1293 ---\n\nB.  Maraviroc\nMaraviroc [ma-RAV-i-rok] is an entry inhibitor that blocks the CCR5 coreceptor that works with gp41 to facilitate\nHIV entry through the membrane into the cell. HIV may express preference for either the CCR5 coreceptor or the\nCXCR4 coreceptor, or both (dual-tropic). Prior to use of maraviroc, a test to determine viral tropism is required to\ndistinguish whether the strain of HIV virus uses the CCR5 coreceptor, the CXCR4 coreceptor, or is dual-tropic.\nOnly strains of HIV that use CCR5 to gain access to the cell can be successfully treated with maraviroc. The drug is\nwell absorbed after oral administration. Maraviroc is metabolized mainly by the hepatic CYP3A isoenzyme, and the\ndose must be reduced when given with most PIs or strong CYP450 inhibitors. Conversely, it should be increased in\npatients receiving efavirenz, etravirine, or strong CYP450 inducers. Maraviroc is generally well tolerated. The drug\nhas been associated with severe hepatotoxicity, which may be preceded by a fever or rash. Monitoring of liver\nfunction is recommended.\n1293\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1294 ---\n\nXII.  Integrase Inhibitors\nRaltegravir [ral-TEG-ra-veer], elvitegravir [el-vi-TEG-ra-vir], dolutegravir [doe-loo-TEG-ra-vir], and bictegravir\n[bik-TEG-ra-vir] are integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), often called integrase inhibitors. These agents\nwork by inhibiting the insertion of proviral DNA into the host cell genome. The active site of the integrase enzyme\nbinds to the host cell DNA and includes two divalent metal cations that serve as chelation targets for the INSTIs. As\na result, when an INSTI is present, the active site of the enzyme is occupied and the integration process is halted.\nThe half-life of elvitegravir is 3 hours when administered alone, but increases to approximately 9 hours when\nboosted by cobicistat . Pharmacokinetic boosting of elvitegravir allows once-daily dosing with food. The INSTIs are\ngenerally well tolerated, with nausea and diarrhea being the most commonly reported adverse effects. Importantly,\nINSTIs are subject to chelation interactions with antacids, resulting in significant reductions in bioavailability.\nTherefore, INSTI doses should be separated from antacids and other polyvalent cations by several hours. Resistance\nto INSTIs occurs with single-point mutations within the integrase gene. Cross-resistance between raltegravir and\nelvitegravir can occur, although dolutegravir has limited cross-resistance to other INSTIs.\n1294\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1295 ---\n\nXIII.  Pharmacokinetic Enhancers\n1295\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1296 ---\n\nA.  Ritonavir\nRitonavir [ri-TOE-na-veer] is no longer used as a single PI but, instead, is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or\n“booster” of other PIs. Ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A, and concomitant ritonavir administration at low\ndoses increases the bioavailability of the second PI, often allowing for longer dosing intervals. The resulting higher\nCmin levels of the “boosted” PI also help to prevent the development of HIV resistance. Therefore, “boosted” PIs are\nrecommended for use in initial HIV regimens in certain clinical situations. Metabolism by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6\nand biliary excretion are the primary methods of elimination. Ritonavir has a half-life of 3 to 5 hours. Although\nritonavir is primarily an inhibitor of CYP450 isoenzymes, it may also induce several CYP450 isoenzymes, and\nnumerous drug interactions have been identified.\n1296\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1297 ---\n\nB.  Cobicistat\nCobicistat  [koe-BIK-i-stat] is a pharmacokinetic enhancer or booster drug used in combination treatments for HIV.\nThis agent inhibits CYP3A isoenzymes and is used to enhance the bioavailability of the protease inhibitors\natazanavir and darunavir, and the integrase inhibitor elvitegravir. Because cobicistat  inhibits CYP3A, CYP2D6,\nand the transporter P-gp, numerous drug interactions exist. Cobicistat  may also cause elevations in serum creatinine\ndue to inhibition of tubular creatinine secretion.\n1297\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1298 ---\n\n34.1\n34.2\n34.3\n34.4\n34.5\n34.6Study Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nA 30-year-old man with human immunodeficiency virus infection is being treated with an antiretroviral\nregimen. Four weeks after initiating therapy, he presents to the emergency department complaining of fever,\nrash, and gastrointestinal upset. His HLA-B*5701 test is positive. Which drug is most likely the cause of his\nsymptoms?\nA.  Zidovudine\nB.  Abacavir\nC.  Efavirenz\nD.  Darunavir\nCorrect answer = B. The abacavir hypersensitivity reaction is characterized by fever, rash, and gastrointestinal\nupset. The patient must stop therapy and should not be rechallenged with abacavir.\nA 75-year-old man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is diagnosed with suspected influenza based\non complaints of flu-like symptoms that began 24 hours ago. Which agent is most appropriate to initiate for\nthe treatment of influenza?\nA.  Oseltamivir\nB.  Zanamivir\nC.  Rimantadine\nD.  Amantadine\nCorrect answer = A. Oseltamivir is the best choice since it is administered orally and not associated with\nresistance. Zanamivir is administered via inhalation and is not recommended for patients with underlying COPD.\nHigh rates of resistance have developed to adamantanes (amantadine, rimantadine), and these drugs are\ninfrequently indicated.\nA 24-year-old woman is diagnosed with genital herpes simplex virus infection. Which agent is indicated for\nuse in this diagnosis?\nA.  Valacyclovir\nB.  Cidofovir\nC.  Ganciclovir\nD.  Zanamivir\nCorrect answer = A. Valacyclovir, famciclovir, penciclovir, and acyclovir are all indicated for herpes simplex\nvirus infection. Cidofovir and ganciclovir are used for CMV retinitis. Zanamivir is indicated for influenza.\nA woman who is being treated for chronic hepatitis B develops nephrotoxicity while on treatment. Which\nmedication is most likely to be included in her HBV treatment?\nA.  Entecavir\nB.  Ribavirin\nC.  Lamivudine\nD.  Adefovir\nCorrect answer = D. Nephrotoxicity is the most commonly seen with adefovir in the treatment of HBV. This\nadverse effect is uncommon with lamivudine and entecavir. Ribavirin is used for the treatment of hepatitis C\ninfection (not HBV).\nWhich class of direct-acting antivirals for hepatitis C works by inhibiting formation of the membranous web\nthat provides a platform for viral replication?\nA.  NS3/NS4A protease inhibitors\nB.  NS5B polymerase inhibitors\nC.  NS5A replication complex inhibitors\nD.  Interferons\nCorrect answer = C. NS5A inhibitors work to inhibit the formation of proteins that form a membranous web,\nwhich serves as a platform for viral replication. NS3/NS4A protease inhibitors prevent processing of the single\npolyprotein encoded by HCV RNA into individually active proteins. NS5B polymerase inhibitors act on the RNA\npolymerase responsible for HCV replication. The mechanism of interferons has not been fully defined.\nWhich antiretroviral drug class chelates with polyvalent cations and, as such, their administration must be\nseparated from antacids by several hours?\nA.  Integrase inhibitors\nB.  Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors\nC.  Protease inhibitors\nD.  Entry inhibitors1298\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1299 ---\n\n34.7\n34.8\n34.9\n34.10Correct answer = A. Integrase inhibitors bind to other positively charged ions, rendering them ineffective. As\nsuch, separation of doses of these agents from aluminum-, magnesium-, and calcium-containing antacids is\nrecommended.\nA 62-year-old man with human immunodeficiency virus infection is being treated with an antiretroviral\nregimen containing elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and has achieved a\nsustained undetectable level of HIV RNA. His prescriber would like to change his therapy to\nelvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide. Which information should the prescriber provide\nto the patient that best summarizes the advantage of tenofovir alafenamide over tenofovir disoproxil\nfumarate?\nA.  Removal of food restrictions\nB.  Fewer drug interactions\nC.  Twice daily dosing\nD.  Improved renal and bone safety profile\nCorrect answer = D. Tenofovir alafenamide delivers the same active drug as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, but\nwith a lower incidence of renal and bone adverse effects. Both tenofovir-containing combinations are dosed once\ndaily and should be taken with food. No change in drug interactions is expected, since tenofovir alafenamide is a\nprodrug which, like TDF, is metabolized to tenofovir.\nA 37-year-old woman with GERD and chronic hepatitis C genotype 1a infection is preparing to begin\ntreatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir. Which is the most appropriate information for the patient regarding use\nof a proton pump inhibitor during treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir?\nA.  Absorption of ledipasvir is increased with increasing pH.\nB.  A proton pump inhibitor can be safely administered with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir without regard to timing of the\ndose or food intake.\nC.  The patient should either stop using the proton pump inhibitor or take it with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir under fasted\nconditions.\nD.  Absorption of ledipasvir is not affected by gastric pH.\nAnswer = C. Absorption of ledipasvir is reduced when gastric pH is increased. Patients receiving proton pump\ninhibitors should stop these agents during HCV therapy with ledipasvir or take the proton pump inhibitor with\nledipasvir/sofosbuvir under fasted conditions to ensure that gastric pH is at its lowest point of the day at the time\nof drug administration.\nWhich HIV antiretroviral is an orally administered entry inhibitor?\nA.

Overview\nIt is estimated that over 25% of the population of the United States will face a diagnosis of cancer during their\nlifetime, with more than 1.6 million new cancer patients diagnosed each year. Less than a quarter of these patients\nwill be cured solely by surgery and/or local radiation. Most of the remainder will receive systemic chemotherapy at\nsome time during their illness. In a small fraction (approximately 10%) of patients with cancer representing selected\nneoplasms, the chemotherapy will result in a cure or a prolonged remission. However, in most cases, drug therapy\nwill produce only a regression of the disease, and complications and/or relapse may eventually lead to death. Thus,\nthe overall 5-year survival rate for cancer patients is about 68%, ranking cancer second only to cardiovascular\ndisease as a cause of mortality. Figure 35.1 provides a list of the anticancer agents discussed in this chapter.\n1301\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1302 ---\n\n1302\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1303 ---\n\n1303\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1304 ---\n\n1304\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1305 ---\n\nFigure 35.1 Summary of chemotherapeutic agents.\n1305\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1306 ---\n\nII.  Principles of Cancer Chemotherapy\nCancer chemotherapy strives to cause a lethal cytotoxic event or apoptosis in the cancer cells that can arrest the\nprogression of tumor growth. The attack is generally directed toward DNA or against metabolic sites essential to cell\nreplication, for example, the availability of purines and pyrimidines, which are the building blocks for DNA or RNA\nsynthesis (Figure 35.2). Ideally, anticancer drugs should interfere only with cellular processes that are unique to\nmalignant cells. Unfortunately, most traditional anticancer drugs do not specifically recognize neoplastic cells but,\nrather, affect all kinds of proliferating cells, both normal and abnormal. Therefore, almost all antitumor agents have\na steep dose–response curve for both therapeutic and toxic effects. Newer agents are being developed that take a\ndifferent approach to cancer treatment by blocking checkpoints and allowing the patient’s own immune system to\nattack cancer cells. While this strategy is showing great promise, adverse effects are also a concern and present as\nautoimmune toxicity, as compared to the myelosuppressive profile with traditional chemotherapy agents.\nFigure 35.2 Examples of chemotherapeutic agents affecting RNA and DNA. dTMP =\ndeoxythymidine monophosphate.\n1306\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1307 ---\n\nA.  Treatment strategies\n1.  Goals of treatment\nThe ultimate goal of chemotherapy is a cure (that is, long-term, disease-free survival). A true cure requires the\neradication of every neoplastic cell. If a cure is not attainable, then the goal becomes control of the disease (prevent\nthe cancer from enlarging and spreading) to extend survival and maintain quality of life. Thus, the individual\nmaintains a “near-normal” existence, with the cancer treated as a chronic disease. In either case, the neoplastic cell\nburden is initially reduced (debulked), either by surgery and/or by radiation, followed by chemotherapy,\nimmunotherapy, therapy using biological modifiers, or a combination of these treatment modalities ( Figure 35.3). In\nadvanced stages of cancer, the likelihood of controlling the cancer is low, and the goal is palliation (alleviation of\nsymptoms and avoidance of life-threatening toxicity). This means that chemotherapeutic drugs may be used to\nrelieve symptoms caused by the cancer and improve the quality of life, even though the drugs may not extend\nsurvival. The goal of treatment should always be kept in mind, as it often influences treatment decisions. Figure 35.4\nillustrates how treatment goals can be dynamic.\nFigure 35.3 Effects of various treatments on the cancer cell burden in a hypothetical\npatient.\nFigure 35.4 Goals of treatment with chemotherapeutic agents.\n1307\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1308 ---\n\n2.  Indications for treatment\nChemotherapy is sometimes used when neoplasms are disseminated and are not amenable to surgery. Chemotherapy\nmay also be used as a supplemental treatment to attack micrometastases following surgery and radiation treatment,\nin which case it is called adjuvant chemotherapy. Chemotherapy given prior to the surgical procedure in an attempt\nto shrink the cancer is referred to as neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and chemotherapy given in lower doses to assist in\nprolonging remission is known as maintenance chemotherapy.\n3.  Tumor susceptibility and the growth cycle\nThe fraction of tumor cells that are in the replicative cycle (“growth fraction”) influences susceptibility to most\ncancer chemotherapeutic agents. Rapidly dividing cells are generally more sensitive to chemotherapy, whereas\nslowly proliferating cells are less sensitive to chemotherapy. In general, nondividing cells (those in the G0 phase;\nFigure 35.5) usually survive the toxic effects of many chemotherapeutic agents.\n1308\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1309 ---\n\n1309\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1310 ---\n\nFigure 35.5 Effects of chemotherapeutic agents on the growth cycle of mammalian cells.\na.  Cell cycle specificity of drugs\nBoth normal cells and tumor cells go through growth cycles (Figure 35.5). However, the number of cells that are in\nvarious stages of the cycle may differ in normal and neoplastic tissues. Chemotherapeutic agents that are effective\nonly against replicating cells (that is, those cells that are dividing) are said to be cell cycle specific ( Figure 35.5),\nwhereas other agents are cell cycle nonspecific. Although the nonspecific drugs generally have greater toxicity in\ncycling cells, they are also useful against tumors that have a low percentage of replicating cells.\nb.  Tumor growth rate\nThe growth rate of most solid tumors is initially rapid, but growth rate usually decreases as the tumor size increases\n(see Figure 35.3). This is due to a deficiency of nutrients and oxygen caused by inadequate vascularization and lack\nof blood circulation. Tumor burden can be reduced through surgery, radiation, or use of cell cycle–nonspecific drugs\nthat promote the remaining cells into active proliferation, thus increasing susceptibility to cell cycle–specific\nchemotherapeutic agents.\n1310\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1311 ---\n\nB.  Treatment regimens and scheduling\nDrug dosages are usually calculated on the basis of body surface area, in an effort to tailor the dosage to each\npatient.\n1.  Log kill phenomenon\nDestruction of cancer cells by chemotherapeutic agents follows first-order kinetics (that is, a given dose of drug\ndestroys a constant fraction of cells). The term “log kill” is used to describe this phenomenon. For example, a\ndiagnosis of leukemia is generally made when there are about 109 (total) leukemic cells. Consequently, if treatment\nleads to a 99.999% kill, then 0.001% of 109 cells (or 104 cells) remain. This is defined as a 5-log kill (reduction of\n105 cells). At this point, the patient becomes asymptomatic, and the patient is in remission (see Figure 35.3). For\nmost bacterial infections, a 5-log (100,000-fold) reduction in the number of microorganisms results in a cure,\nbecause the immune system can destroy the remaining bacterial cells. However, tumor cells are not as readily\neliminated, and additional treatment is required to totally eradicate the leukemic cell population.\n2.  Pharmacologic sanctuaries\nLeukemic or other tumor cells find sanctuary in tissues such as the central nervous system (CNS), where transport\nconstraints prevent certain chemotherapeutic agents from entrance. Therefore, a patient may require irradiation of\nthe craniospinal axis or intrathecal administration of drugs to eliminate leukemic cells at that site. Similarly, drugs\nmay be unable to penetrate certain areas of solid tumors.\n3.  Treatment protocols\nCombination chemotherapy is more successful than single-drug treatment in most cancers for which chemotherapy\nis effective.\na.  Combination chemotherapy\nCytotoxic agents with different toxicities, and with different molecular sites and mechanisms of action, are usually\ncombined at full doses. This results in higher response rates, due to additive and/or potentiated cytotoxic effects, and\nnonoverlapping host toxicities. In contrast, agents with similar dose-limiting toxicities, such as myelosuppression,\nnephrotoxicity, or cardiotoxicity, can be combined safely only by reducing the doses of each.\nb.  Advantages of combinations\nThe advantages of combination chemotherapy are that it 1) provides maximal cell killing within the range of\ntolerated toxicity, 2) is effective against a broader range of cell lines in the heterogeneous tumor population, and 3)\nmay delay or prevent the development of resistant cell lines.\nc.  Treatment protocols\nMany cancer treatment protocols have been developed, and each is applicable to a particular neoplastic state. They\nare usually identified by an acronym. For example, a common regimen called R-CHOP, used for the treatment of\nnon-Hodgkin lymphoma, consists of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin (doxorubicin), Oncovin\n(vincristine), and prednisone. Therapy is scheduled intermittently to allow recovery or rescue of the immune system,\nwhich is also affected by the chemotherapeutic agents, thus reducing the risk of serious infection.\n1311\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1312 ---\n\nC.  Resistance and toxicity with chemotherapy\nCancer drugs are toxins that present a lethal threat to the cells. It is, therefore, not surprising that cells have evolved\nelaborate defense mechanisms to protect themselves from chemical toxins, including chemotherapeutic agents.\n1.  Resistance\nSome neoplastic cells (for example, melanoma) are inherently resistant to most anticancer drugs. Other tumor types\nmay acquire resistance to the cytotoxic effects of a drug by mutating, particularly after prolonged administration of\nsuboptimal doses. The development of drug resistance is minimized by short-term, intensive, intermittent therapy\nwith combinations of drugs. Drug combinations are also effective against a broader range of resistant cells in the\ntumor population.\n2.  Multidrug resistance\nStepwise selection of an amplified gene that codes for a transmembrane protein (P-glycoprotein for “permeability”\nglycoprotein; Figure 35.6) is responsible for multidrug resistance. This resistance is due to adenosine triphosphate–\ndependent pumping of drugs out of the cell in the presence of P-glycoprotein. Cross-resistance following the use of\nstructurally unrelated agents also occurs. For example, cells that are resistant to the cytotoxic effects of the Vinca\nalkaloids are also resistant to dactinomycin and to the anthracycline antibiotics, as well as to colchicine, and vice\nversa. These drugs are all naturally occurring substances, each of which has a hydrophobic aromatic ring and a\npositive charge at neutral pH. [Note: P-glycoprotein is normally expressed at low levels in most cell types, but\nhigher levels are found in the kidney, liver, pancreas, small intestine, colon, and adrenal gland. It has been suggested\nthat the presence of P-glycoprotein may account for the intrinsic resistance to chemotherapy observed with\nadenocarcinomas.] Certain drugs at high concentrations (for example, verapamil ) can inhibit the pump and, thus,\ninterfere with the efflux of the anticancer agent. However, these drugs are undesirable because of adverse\npharmacologic actions of their own. Pharmacologically inert pump blockers are being sought.\n1312\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1313 ---\n\nFigure 35.6 The six membrane-spanning loops of the P-glycoprotein form a central\nchannel for the ATP-dependent pumping of drugs from the cell.\n3.  Toxicity\nTherapy aimed at killing rapidly dividing cancer cells also affects normal cells undergoing rapid proliferation (for\nexample, cells of the buccal mucosa, bone marrow, gastrointestinal [GI] mucosa, and hair follicles), contributing to\nthe toxic manifestations of chemotherapy.\na.  Common adverse effects\nMost chemotherapeutic agents have a narrow therapeutic index. Severe vomiting, stomatitis, bone marrow\nsuppression, and alopecia occur to varying extents during therapy with most antineoplastic agents. Vomiting is often\ncontrolled by administration of antiemetic drugs. Some toxicities, such as myelosuppression that predisposes to\ninfection, are common to many chemotherapeutic agents (Figure 35.7), whereas other adverse reactions are confined\nto specific agents, such as bladder toxicity with cyclophosphamide, cardiotoxicity with doxorubicin, and pulmonary\nfibrosis with bleomycin. The duration of the adverse effects varies widely. For example, alopecia is transient, but the\ncardiac, pulmonary, and bladder toxicities can be irreversible.\nFigure 35.7 Comparison of myelosuppressive potential of chemotherapeutic drugs.\nb.  Minimizing adverse effects\nSome toxic reactions may be ameliorated by interventions, such as the use of cytoprotectant drugs, local perfusion of\nthe tumor (for example, a sarcoma of the arm), removal of some marrow of the patient prior to intensive treatment\nand then reimplantation afterward, or intensive hydration and diuresis to prevent bladder toxicities. The\nmegaloblastic anemia that occurs with methotrexate can be effectively counteracted by administering folinic acid\n(leucovorin). With the availability of human granulocyte colony-stimulating factors, the neutropenia associated with1313\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1314 ---\n\ntreatment of cancer by many drugs can be partially reversed.\n4.  Treatment-induced tumors\nBecause most antineoplastic agents are mutagens, neoplasms (for example, acute nonlymphocytic leukemia) may\narise 10 or more years after the original cancer was cured. [Note: Treatment-induced neoplasms are especially a\nproblem after therapy with alkylating agents.] Most tumors that develop from cancer chemotherapeutic agents\nrespond well to treatment strategies.\n1314\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1315 ---\n\nIII.  Antimetabolites\nAntimetabolites are structurally related to normal compounds that exist within the cell ( Figure 35.8). They generally\ninterfere with the availability of normal purine or pyrimidine nucleotide precursors, either by inhibiting their\nsynthesis or by competing with them in DNA or RNA synthesis. Their maximal cytotoxic effects are in S phase and\nare, therefore, cell cycle specific.\nFigure 35.8 Summary of antimetabolites. CBC = complete blood count; CNS = central\nnervous system; D = diarrhea; IM = intramuscular; IT = intrathecal; IV = intravenous; N\n= nausea; NSAID = nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug; PO = oral; SC = subcutaneous;\nSMZ/TMP = sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim; V = vomiting.\n1315\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1316 ---\n\nA.  Methotrexate, pemetrexed, and pralatrexate\nThe vitamin folic acid plays a central role in a variety of metabolic reactions involving the transfer of one-carbon\nunits and is essential for cell replication. Folic acid is obtained mainly from dietary sources and from that produced\nby intestinal flora. Methotrexate [meth-oh-TREK-sate] (MTX ), pemetrexed [pem-e-TREX-ed], and pralatrexate\n[pral-a-TREX-ate] are antifolate agents.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nMTX  is structurally related to folic acid and acts as an antagonist of the vitamin by inhibiting mammalian\ndihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), the enzyme that converts folic acid to its active, coenzyme form, tetrahydrofolic\nacid (FH4) (Figure 35.9). The inhibition of DHFR can only be reversed by a 1000-fold excess of the natural\nsubstrate, dihydrofolate (FH2), or by administration of leucovorin, which bypasses the blocked enzyme and\nreplenishes the folate pool (Figure 35.9). [Note: Leucovorin, or folinic acid, is the N5-formyl group–carrying form of\nFH4.] MTX  is specific for the S phase of the cell cycle. Pemetrexed is an antimetabolite similar in mechanism to\nmethotrexate. However, in addition to inhibiting DHFR, it also inhibits thymidylate synthase and other enzymes\ninvolved in folate metabolism and DNA synthesis. Pralatrexate is an antimetabolite that also inhibits DHFR.\n1316\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1317 ---\n\nFigure 35.9 Mechanism of action of methotrexate  and the effect of administration of\nleucovorin.

Therapeutic uses\nMTX , usually in combination with other drugs, is effective against acute lymphocytic leukemia, Burkitt lymphoma\nin children, breast cancer, bladder cancer, and head and neck carcinomas. In addition, low-dose MTX  is effective as\na single agent against certain inflammatory diseases, such as severe psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as\nCrohn disease. All patients receiving MTX  require close monitoring for possible toxic effects. Pemetrexed is\nprimarily used in non–small cell lung cancer. Pralatrexate is used in relapsed or refractory T-cell lymphoma.\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\nMTX  is variably absorbed at low doses from the GI tract, but it can also be administered by intramuscular,\nintravenous (IV), and intrathecal routes (Figure 35.10). Because MTX  does not easily penetrate the blood–brain\nbarrier, it can be administered intrathecally to destroy neoplastic cells that thrive in the sanctuary of the CNS. High\nconcentrations of the drug are found in the intestinal epithelium, liver, and kidney, as well as in ascites and pleural\neffusions. MTX is also distributed to the skin. Small amounts of MTX  undergo hydroxylation at the 7th position to\nform 7-hydroxymethotrexate. This derivative is less water soluble than MTX  and may lead to crystalluria. Therefore,\nit is important to keep the urine alkaline and the patient well hydrated to avoid renal toxicity. Excretion of the parent\ndrug and the 7-OH metabolite occurs primarily via urine.\nFigure 35.10 Administration and fate of methotrexate. CNS = central nervous system; IV\n= intravenous; IM = intramuscular.\n4.  Adverse effects\nAdverse effects of MTX  are outlined in Figure 35.8. Pemetrexed and pralatrexate should be given with folic acid\nand vitamin B12 supplements to reduce hematologic and GI toxicities. Pretreatment with corticosteroids to prevent\ncutaneous reactions is recommended with pemetrexed.\n1318\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1319 ---\n\nB.  6-Mercaptopurine\n6-Mercaptopurine [mer-kap-toe-PYOOR-een] (6-MP ), a purine antimetabolite, is the thiol analog of hypoxanthine.\n6-MP  and 6-thioguanine were the first purine analogs to prove beneficial for treating neoplastic disease. [Note:\nAzathioprine, an immunosuppressant, exerts its cytotoxic effects after conversion to 6-MP .] 6-MP  is used principally\nin the maintenance of remission in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. 6-MP  and its analog, azathioprine, are also\nbeneficial in the treatment of Crohn disease. Adverse effects are noted in Figure 35.8.\n1319\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1320 ---\n\nC.  Fludarabine\nFludarabine [floo-DARE-a-been] is the 5′-phosphate of 2-fluoroadenine arabinoside, a purine nucleotide analog. It\nis useful in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia, and indolent non-Hodgkin\nlymphoma. Fludarabine is a prodrug, and the phosphate is removed in the plasma to form 2-F-araA, which is taken\nup into cells and again phosphorylated (initially by deoxycytidine kinase). Although the exact cytotoxic mechanism\nis uncertain, the triphosphate is incorporated into both DNA and RNA. This decreases their synthesis in the S phase\nand affects their function. Resistance is associated with reduced uptake into cells, lack of deoxycytidine kinase, and\ndecreased affinity for DNA polymerase, as well as other mechanisms. Fludarabine is administered IV rather than\norally, because intestinal bacteria split off the sugar to yield the very toxic metabolite, fluoroadenine.\n1320\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1321 ---\n\nD.  5-Fluorouracil\n5-Fluorouracil  [flure-oh-YOOR-ah-sil] (5-FU), a pyrimidine analog, has a stable fluorine atom in place of a\nhydrogen atom at position 5 of the uracil ring. The fluorine interferes with the conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to\nthymidylic acid, thus depriving the cell of thymidine, one of the essential precursors for DNA synthesis. 5-FU is\nemployed primarily in the treatment of slow-growing solid tumors (for example, colorectal, breast, ovarian,\npancreatic, and gastric carcinomas). When applied topically, 5-FU is also effective for the treatment of superficial\nbasal cell carcinomas.\n1.  Mechanism of action\n5-FU itself is devoid of antineoplastic activity. It enters the cell through a carrier-mediated transport system and is\nconverted to the corresponding deoxynucleotide (5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate [5-FdUMP]; Figure 35.11),\nwhich competes with deoxyuridine monophosphate for thymidylate synthase, thus inhibiting its action. DNA\nsynthesis decreases due to lack of thymidine, leading to imbalanced cell growth and “thymidine-less death” of\nrapidly dividing cells. [Note: Leucovorin is administered with 5-FU, because the reduced folate coenzyme is\nrequired in the thymidylate synthase inhibition. For example, a standard regimen for advanced colorectal cancer is\nirinotecan plus 5-FU/leucovorin.] 5-FU is also incorporated into RNA, and low levels have been detected in DNA.\nIn the latter case, a glycosylase excises the 5-FU, damaging the DNA. 5-FU produces the anticancer effect in the S\nphase of the cell cycle.\n1321\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1322 ---\n\nFigure 35.11 Mechanism of the cytotoxic action of 5-FU. 5-FU is converted to 5-\nfluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (5-FdUMP), which competes with deoxyuridine\nmonophosphate (dUMP) for the enzyme thymidylate synthase. 5-FU = 5-fluorouracil; 5-\n1322\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1323 ---\n\nFUR = 5-fluorouridine; 5-FUMP = 5-fluorouridine monophosphate; 5-FUDP = 5-\nfluorouridine diphosphate; 5-FUTP = 5-fluorouridine triphosphate; dUMP =\ndeoxyuridine monophosphate; dTMP = deoxythymidine monophosphate.\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\nBecause of severe toxicity to the GI tract, 5-FU is administered IV or, in the case of skin cancer, topically. The drug\npenetrates well into all tissues, including the CNS. 5-FU is rapidly metabolized in the liver, lung, and kidney. It is\neventually converted to fluoro-β-alanine, which is removed in the urine. Elevated levels of dihydropyrimidine\ndehydrogenase (DPD) can increase the rate of 5-FU catabolism and decrease its bioavailability. The level of DPD\nvaries from individual to individual and may differ by as much as six-fold in the general population. Patients with\nDPD deficiency may experience severe toxicity manifested by pancytopenia, mucositis, and life-threatening\ndiarrhea. Knowledge of DPD activity in an individual should allow more appropriate dosing of 5-FU.\n1323\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1324 ---\n\nE.  Capecitabine\nCapecitabine [KAP-e-SYE-ta-been] is a fluoropyrimidine carbamate. It is used in the treatment of colorectal and\nmetastatic breast cancer. Capecitabine is well absorbed following oral administration. After being absorbed,\ncapecitabine, which is itself nontoxic, undergoes a series of enzymatic reactions, the last of which is hydrolysis to 5-\nFU. This step is catalyzed by thymidine phosphorylase, an enzyme that is concentrated primarily in tumors (Figure\n35.12). Thus, the cytotoxic activity of capecitabine is the same as that of 5-FU and is tumor specific. The most\nimportant enzyme inhibited by 5-FU (and, thus, capecitabine) is thymidylate synthase.\nFigure 35.12 Metabolic pathway of capecitabine to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). 5′-dFCR = 5′-\ndeoxy-5-fluorocytidine; 5′-dFUR = 5′-deoxy-5-fluorouridine.\n1324\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1325 ---\n\nF.  Cytarabine\nCytarabine [sye-TARE-ah-been] (cytosine arabinoside or ara-C ) is an analog of 2′-deoxycytidine in which the\nnatural ribose residue is replaced by D-arabinose. Cytarabine acts as a pyrimidine antagonist. The major clinical use\nof cytarabine is in acute nonlymphocytic (myelogenous) leukemia (AML). Cytarabine enters the cell by a carrier-\nmediated process and, like the other purine and pyrimidine antagonists, must be sequentially phosphorylated by\ndeoxycytidine kinase and other nucleotide kinases to the nucleotide form (cytosine arabinoside triphosphate or ara-\nCTP) to be cytotoxic. Ara-CTP is an effective inhibitor of DNA polymerase. The nucleotide is also incorporated into\nnuclear DNA and can terminate chain elongation. It is, therefore, S phase (and, hence, cell cycle) specific.\n1.  Pharmacokinetics\nCytarabine is not effective when given orally, because of deamination to the noncytotoxic ara-U by cytidine\ndeaminase in the intestinal mucosa and liver. Given IV, it distributes throughout the body but does not penetrate the\nCNS in sufficient amounts. Therefore, it may also be injected intrathecally. Cytarabine undergoes extensive\noxidative deamination in the body to ara-U, a pharmacologically inactive metabolite. Both cytarabine and ara-U are\nexcreted in urine.\n1325\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1326 ---\n\nG.  Azacitidine\nAzacitidine [A-zuh-SITE-i-dine] is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. It is used for the treatment of\nmyelodysplastic syndromes and AML. Azacitidine undergoes activation to the nucleotide metabolite azacitidine\ntriphosphate and gets incorporated into RNA to inhibit RNA processing and function. It is S-phase cell cycle\nspecific.\n1326\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1327 ---\n\nH.  Gemcitabine\nGemcitabine [jem-SITE-ah-been] is an analog of the nucleoside deoxycytidine. It is used most commonly for\npancreatic cancer and non–small cell lung cancer. Gemcitabine is a substrate for deoxycytidine kinase, which\nphosphorylates the drug to 2′,2′-difluorodeoxycytidine triphosphate (Figure 35.13). Gemcitabine is administered by\nIV infusion. It is deaminated to difluorodeoxyuridine, which is not cytotoxic, and is excreted in urine.\nFigure 35.13 Mechanism of action of gemcitabine.\n1327\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1328 ---\n\nAntibiotics\nThe antitumor antibiotics (Figure 35.14) owe their cytotoxic action primarily to their interactions with DNA, leading\nto disruption of DNA function. In addition to intercalation, their abilities to inhibit topoisomerases (I and II) and\nproduce free radicals also play a major role in their cytotoxic effect. They are cell cycle nonspecific, with bleomycin\nas an exception.\nFigure 35.14 Summary of antitumor antibiotics.

Anthracyclines: Doxorubicin, daunorubicin, idarubicin,\nepirubicin, and mitoxantrone\nDoxorubicin [dox-oh-ROO-bi-sin] and daunorubicin [daw-noe-ROO-bi-sin] are classified as anthracycline\nantibiotics. Doxorubicin is the hydroxylated analog of daunorubicin. Idarubicin [eye-da-ROO-bi-sin], the 4-\ndemethoxy analog of daunorubicin, epirubicin [eh-pee-ROO-bih-sin], and mitoxantrone [mye-toe-ZAN-trone] are\nalso available. Therapeutic uses for these agents differ despite their structural similarity and apparently similar\nmechanisms of action. Doxorubicin is one of the most important and widely used anticancer drugs. It is used in\ncombination with other agents for treatment of sarcomas and a variety of carcinomas, including breast cancer, as\nwell as for treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia and lymphomas. Daunorubicin and idarubicin are used in the\ntreatment of acute leukemias, and mitoxantrone is used in prostate cancer.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nDoxorubicin and other anthracyclines induce cytotoxicity through several different mechanisms. For example,\ndoxorubicin-derived free radicals can induce membrane lipid peroxidation, DNA strand scission, and direct\noxidation of purine or pyrimidine bases, thiols, and amines (Figure 35.15).\nFigure 35.15 Doxorubicin interacts with molecular oxygen, producing superoxide ions\nand hydrogen peroxide, which cause single-strand breaks in DNA.\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\nThese agents must be administered intravenously, because they are inactivated in the GI tract. Extravasation is a\nserious problem that can lead to tissue necrosis. The anthracycline antibiotics bind to plasma proteins as well as to\nother tissue components, where they are widely distributed. They do not penetrate the blood–brain barrier or the\ntestes. These agents undergo extensive hepatic metabolism, and dosage adjustments are needed in patients with\nimpaired hepatic function. Biliary excretion is the major route of elimination. Because of the dark red color of the\nanthracycline drugs, the veins may become visible surrounding the site of infusion, and red discoloration of urine\nmay occur.\n3.  Adverse effects\nIrreversible, dose-dependent cardiotoxicity is the most serious adverse reaction and is more common with\ndaunorubicin and doxorubicin than with idarubicin and epirubicin. Cardiotoxicity apparently results from the\ngeneration of free radicals and lipid peroxidation. Addition of trastuzumab to protocols with doxorubicin or\nepirubicin increases the risk of congestive heart failure. There has been some success with the iron chelator\ndexrazoxane in protecting against the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin. The liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin is\nreported to be less cardiotoxic than the standard formulation.1329\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1330 ---\n\n1330\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1331 ---\n\nB.  Bleomycin\nBleomycin [blee-oh-MYE-sin] is a mixture of different copper-chelating glycopeptides that, like the anthracycline\nantibiotics, cause scission of DNA by an oxidative process. Bleomycin is cell cycle specific and causes cells to\naccumulate in the G2 phase. It is primarily used in the treatment of testicular cancers and Hodgkin lymphoma.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nA DNA–bleomycin–Fe2+ complex appears to undergo oxidation to bleomycin–Fe3+. The liberated electrons react\nwith oxygen to form superoxide or hydroxyl radicals, which, in turn, attack the phosphodiester bonds of DNA,\nresulting in strand breakage and chromosomal aberrations (Figure 35.16).\nFigure 35.16 Bleomycin causes breaks in DNA by an oxidative process.\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\nBleomycin is administered by a number of routes. The bleomycin-inactivating enzyme (a hydrolase) is high in a\nnumber of tissues (for example, liver and spleen) but is low in the lung and absent in the skin, accounting for\ntoxicity in those tissues. Most of the parent drug is excreted unchanged in the urine, necessitating dose adjustment in\npatients with renal failure.\n3.  Adverse effects\nPulmonary toxicity is the most serious adverse effect, progressing from rales, cough, and infiltrate to potentially\nfatal fibrosis. The pulmonary fibrosis that is caused by bleomycin is often referred as “bleomycin lung.”\nHypertrophic skin changes and hyperpigmentation of the hands are prevalent. Bleomycin is unusual in that\nmyelosuppression is rare.\n1331\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1332 ---\n\n1332\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1333 ---\n\nV.  Alkylating Agents\nAlkylating agents (Figure 35.17) exert their cytotoxic effects by covalently binding to nucleophilic groups on\nvarious cell constituents. Alkylation of DNA is probably the crucial cytotoxic reaction that is lethal to the tumor\ncells. Alkylating agents do not discriminate between cycling and resting cells, even though they are most toxic for\nrapidly dividing cells. They are used in combination with other agents to treat a wide variety of lymphatic and solid\ncancers. In addition to being cytotoxic, all are mutagenic and carcinogenic and can lead to secondary malignancies\nsuch as acute leukemia.\nFigure 35.17 Summary of alkylating agents. CBC = complete blood count; CNS =\ncentral nervous system; D = diarrhea; IV = intravenous; N = nausea; PFT = pulmonary\nfunction test; PO = by mouth; V = vomiting.\n1333\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1334 ---\n\nA.  Cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide\nThese drugs are very closely related mustard agents that share most of the same primary mechanisms and toxicities.\nThey are cytotoxic only after generation of their alkylating species, which are produced through hydroxylation by\ncytochrome P450 (CYP450). These agents have a broad clinical spectrum and are used as single agents or in\ncombinations in the treatment of a wide variety of neoplastic diseases, such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, sarcoma,\nand breast cancer.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nCyclophosphamide [sye-kloe-FOSS-fah-mide] is the most commonly used alkylating agent. Both cyclophosphamide\nand ifosfamide [eye-FOSS-fah-mide] are first biotransformed to hydroxylated intermediates primarily in the liver by\nthe CYP450 system (Figure 35.18). The hydroxylated intermediates then undergo metabolism to form the active\ncompounds, phosphoramide mustard and acrolein. Reaction of the phosphoramide mustard with DNA is considered\nto be the cytotoxic step.\nFigure 35.18 Activation of cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide by hepatic cytochrome\nP450.\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\nCyclophosphamide is available in oral and IV preparations, whereas ifosfamide is IV only. Cyclophosphamide is\nmetabolized in the liver to active and inactive metabolites, and minimal amounts are excreted in the urine as\nunchanged drug. Ifosfamide is metabolized primarily by CYP450 3A4 and 2B6 isoenzymes. It is mainly renally\nexcreted.\n3.  Adverse effects\nA unique toxicity of both drugs is hemorrhagic cystitis, which can lead to fibrosis of the bladder. Bladder toxicity\nhas been attributed to acrolein in the urine in the case of cyclophosphamide and to toxic metabolites of ifosfamide.\nAdequate hydration as well as IV injection of mesna (sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate), which neutralizes the\ntoxic metabolites, can minimize this problem. Neurotoxicity has been reported in patients on high-dose ifosfamide,\nprobably due to the metabolite, chloroacetaldehyde.\n1334\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1335 ---\n\nB.  Nitrosoureas\nCarmustine [KAR-mus-teen, BCNU] and lomustine [LOE-mus-teen, CCNU] are closely related nitrosoureas.\nBecause of their ability to penetrate the CNS, the nitrosoureas are primarily employed in the treatment of brain\ntumors.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nThe nitrosoureas exert cytotoxic effects by an alkylation that inhibits replication and, eventually, RNA and protein\nsynthesis. Although they alkylate DNA in resting cells, cytotoxicity is expressed primarily in cells that are actively\ndividing. Therefore, nondividing cells can escape death if DNA repair occurs. Nitrosoureas also inhibit several key\nenzymatic processes by carbamoylation of amino acids in proteins in the targeted cells.\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\nCarmustine is administered IV and as chemotherapy wafer implants, whereas lomustine is given orally. Because of\ntheir lipophilicity, these agents distribute widely in the body and readily penetrate the CNS. The drugs undergo\nextensive metabolism. Lomustine is metabolized to active products. The kidney is the major excretory route for the\nnitrosoureas (Figure 35.19).\nFigure 35.19 Administration and fate of carmustine/lomustine. IV = intravenous.\n1335\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1336 ---\n\nC.  Dacarbazine and temozolomide\nDacarbazine [dah-KAR-bah-zeen] is an alkylating agent that must undergo biotransformation to an active\nmetabolite, methyltriazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). The metabolite is responsible for the alkylating activity\nof this agent by forming methyl carbonium ions that attack the nucleophilic groups in the DNA molecule. The\ncytotoxic action of dacarbazine has been attributed to the ability of its metabolite to methylate DNA on the O-6\nposition of guanine. Dacarbazine has found use in the treatment of melanoma and Hodgkin lymphoma.\nTemozolomide [te-moe-ZOE-loe-mide] is related to dacarbazine, because both must undergo biotransformation\nto an active metabolite, MTIC, which is likely responsible for the methylation of DNA on the O-6 and N-7 position\nof guanine. Unlike dacarbazine, temozolomide does not require the CYP450 system for metabolic transformation,\nand it undergoes chemical transformation at normal physiological pH. Temozolomide also inhibits the repair\nenzyme, O-6-guanine-DNA alkyltransferase. Temozolomide differs from dacarbazine in that it crosses the blood–\nbrain barrier and, therefore, is used in the treatment of brain tumors such as glioblastomas and astrocytomas. It is\nalso used in metastatic melanoma. Temozolomide is administered intravenously or orally and has excellent\nbioavailability after oral administration. The parent drug and metabolites are excreted in urine (Figure 35.20).\nFigure 35.20 Administration and fate of temozolomide and dacarbazine. IV =\nintravenous.\n1336\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1337 ---\n\nD.  Other alkylating agents\nMechlorethamine [mek-lor-ETH-ah-meen] was developed as a vesicant (nitrogen mustard) during World War I. Its\nability to cause lymphocytopenia led to its use in lymphatic cancers. Melphalan [MEL-fah-lan], a phenylalanine\nderivative of nitrogen mustard, is used in the treatment of multiple myeloma. This is a bifunctional alkylating agent\nthat can be given orally, although the plasma concentration differs from patient to patient due to variation in\nintestinal absorption and metabolism. The dose of melphalan is carefully adjusted by monitoring the platelet and\nwhite blood cell counts. Chlorambucil  [clor-AM-byoo-sil] is another bifunctional alkylating agent that is used in the\ntreatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Busulfan [byoo-SUL-fan] is an alkylating agent that is effective against\nchronic myelogenous leukemia. This agent can cause pulmonary fibrosis (“busulfan lung”). Like other alkylating\nagents, all of these agents are leukemogenic.\n1337\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1338 ---\n\nVI.  Microtubule Inhibitors\nThe mitotic spindle is part of a larger, intracellular skeleton (cytoskeleton) that is essential for the movements of\nstructures occurring in the cytoplasm of all eukaryotic cells. The mitotic spindle consists of chromatin plus a system\nof microtubules composed of the protein tubulin. The mitotic spindle is essential for the equal partitioning of DNA\ninto the two daughter cells that are formed when a eukaryotic cell divides. Several plant-derived substances used as\nanticancer drugs disrupt this process by affecting the equilibrium between the polymerized and depolymerized forms\nof the microtubules, thereby causing cytotoxicity. The microtubule inhibitors are summarized in Figure 35.21.\nFigure 35.21 Summary of microtubule inhibitors. CBC = complete blood count; D =\ndiarrhea; IT = intrathecal; IV = intravenous; N = nausea; V = vomiting.\n1338\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1339 ---\n\nA.  Vincristine and vinblastine\nVincristine [vin-KRIS-teen] (VX ) and vinblastine [vin-BLAS-teen] (VBL ) are structurally related compounds derived\nfrom the periwinkle plant, Vinca rosea . They are, therefore, referred to as the Vinca alkaloids. A less neurotoxic\nagent is vinorelbine [vye-NOR-el-been] (VRB ). Although the Vinca alkaloids are structurally similar, their\ntherapeutic indications are different. They are generally administered in combination with other drugs. VX is used in\nthe treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children, Wilms tumor, Ewing soft tissue sarcoma, and Hodgkin\nand non-Hodgkin lymphomas, as well as some other rapidly proliferating neoplasms. [Note: VX (former trade name,\nOncovin) is the “O” in the R-CHOP regimen for lymphoma. Due to relatively mild myelosuppressive activity, VX is\nused in a number of other protocols.] VBL is administered with bleomycin and cisplatin for the treatment of\nmetastatic testicular carcinoma. It is also used in the treatment of systemic Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas.\nVRB is beneficial in the treatment of advanced non–small cell lung cancer, either as a single agent or with cisplatin.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nThese agents are cell cycle specific and phase specific, because they block mitosis in metaphase (M phase). Their\nbinding to the microtubular protein, tubulin, blocks the ability of tubulin to polymerize to form microtubules.\nInstead, paracrystalline aggregates consisting of tubulin dimers and the alkaloid drug are formed. The resulting\ndysfunctional spindle apparatus, frozen in metaphase, prevents chromosomal segregation and cell proliferation\n(Figure 35.22).\n1339\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1340 ---\n\n1340\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1341 ---\n\nFigure 35.22 Mechanism of action of the microtubule inhibitors.\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\nIV injection of these agents leads to rapid cytotoxic effects and cell destruction. This, in turn, can cause\nhyperuricemia due to the oxidation of purines that are released from fragmenting DNA molecules. The Vinca\nalkaloids are concentrated and metabolized in the liver by the CYP450 pathway and eliminated in bile and feces.\nDosage adjustment is required in patients with impaired hepatic function or biliary obstruction.\n3.  Adverse effects\nVX and VBL  are both associated with phlebitis or cellulitis if extravasation occurs during injection, as well as nausea,\nvomiting, diarrhea, and alopecia. VBL is a potent myelosuppressant, whereas peripheral neuropathy (paresthesias,\nloss of reflexes, foot drop, and ataxia) and constipation are more common with VX. These agents should not be\nadministered intrathecally. This potential drug error can result in death, and special precautions should be in place\nfor administration.\n1341\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1342 ---\n\nB.  Paclitaxel and docetaxel\nPaclitaxel  [PAK-li-tax-el] was the first member of the taxane family to be used in cancer chemotherapy.\nSemisynthetic paclitaxel  is available through chemical modification of a precursor found in the needles of Pacific\nyew species. An albumin-bound form is also available. Substitution of a side chain resulted in docetaxel  [doe-see-\nTAX-el], which is the more potent of the two drugs. Paclitaxel  has good activity against advanced ovarian cancer\nand metastatic breast cancer, as well as non–small cell lung cancer when administered with cisplatin. Docetaxel  is\ncommonly used in prostate, breast, GI, and non–small cell lung cancers.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nBoth drugs are active in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, but unlike the Vinca alkaloids, they promote\npolymerization and stabilization of the polymer rather than disassembly, leading to the accumulation of\nmicrotubules (Figure 35.23). The microtubules formed are overly stable and nonfunctional, and chromosome\ndesegregation does not occur. This results in cell death.\n1342\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1343 ---\n\nFigure 35.23 Paclitaxel stabilizes microtubules, rendering them nonfunctional.\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\n1343\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1344 ---\n\nThese agents undergo hepatic metabolism by the CYP450 system and are excreted via the biliary system. Dosages\nshould be reduced in patients with hepatic dysfunction.\n3.  Adverse effects\nThe dose-limiting toxicities of paclitaxel  and docetaxel  are neutropenia and leukopenia. Peripheral neuropathy is\nalso a common adverse effect with the taxanes. [Note: Because of serious hypersensitivity reactions (including\ndyspnea, urticaria, and hypotension), patients who are treated with paclitaxel  should be premedicated with\ndexamethasone and diphenhydramine, as well as with an H2 receptor antagonist.]\n1344\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1345 ---\n\nVII.  Steroid Hormones and Their Antagonists\nTumors that are sensitive to steroid hormones may be either 1) hormone responsive, in which the tumor regresses\nfollowing treatment with a specific hormone; or 2) hormone dependent, in which removal of a hormonal stimulus\ncauses tumor regression; or 3) both. Removal of hormonal stimuli from hormone-dependent tumors can be\naccomplished by surgery (for example, in the case of orchiectomy—surgical removal of one or both testes—for\npatients with advanced prostate cancer) or by drugs (for example, in breast cancer treatment with the antiestrogen\ntamoxifen prevents estrogen stimulation of breast cancer cells; Figure 35.24). For a steroid hormone to influence a\ncell, that cell must have intracellular (cytosolic) receptors that are specific for that hormone (Figure 35.25A).\nFigure 35.24 Summary of steroid hormones and their antagonists. IM = intramuscular;\nLHRH = luteinizing hormone–releasing hormone; N = nausea; PO = oral administration;\nPSA = prostate-specific antigen; SC = subcutaneous; V = vomiting.\n1345\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1346 ---\n\n1346\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1347 ---\n\nFigure 35.25 Action of steroid hormones and antiestrogen agents. mRNA = messenger\nRNA.\n1347\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1348 ---\n\nA.  Tamoxifen\nTamoxifen [tah-MOX-ih-fen] is a selective estrogen modulator (SERM). It is an estrogen antagonist in breast tissue\nand an agonist in other tissues, such as bone and the endometrium. Tamoxifen is used for first-line therapy in the\ntreatment of estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer. It is also used for prevention of breast cancer in high-risk\nwomen.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nTamoxifen competes with estrogen for binding to estrogen receptors in the breast tissue, and inhibits estrogen-\ninduced growth of breast cancer (Figure 35.25B ). The result is a depletion (down-regulation) of estrogen receptors,\nand the growth-promoting effects of the natural hormone and other growth factors are suppressed.\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\nTamoxifen is effective after oral administration. It is partially metabolized by the liver. Some metabolites possess\nestrogen antagonist activity, whereas others have agonist activity. Unchanged drug and metabolites are excreted\npredominantly through the bile into the feces. Tamoxifen is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein.\n3.  Adverse effects\nAdverse effects caused by tamoxifen include hot flashes, nausea, vomiting, skin rash, and vaginal bleeding and\ndischarge (due to estrogenic activity of the drug and some of its metabolites in the endometrial tissue). Tamoxifen\nhas the potential to cause endometrial cancer. Other toxicities include thromboembolism and effects on vision.\n1348\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1349 ---\n\nB.  Fulvestrant and raloxifene\nFulvestrant  [fool-VES-trant] is an estrogen receptor antagonist that is given via intramuscular injection to patients\nwith hormone receptor–positive metastatic breast cancer. This agent binds to and causes estrogen receptor down-\nregulation on tumors and other targets. Raloxifene [ral-OKS-i-feen] is an oral SERM that blocks estrogen effects in\nthe uterine and breast tissues, while promoting effects in the bone to inhibit resorption. This agent reduces the risk of\nestrogen receptor–positive invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Both drugs are known to cause hot\nflashes, arthralgias, and myalgias.\n1349\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1350 ---\n\nC.  Aromatase inhibitors\nThe aromatase reaction is responsible for extra-adrenal synthesis of estrogen from androstenedione, which takes\nplace in liver, fat, muscle, skin, and breast tissues, including breast malignancies. Peripheral aromatization is an\nimportant source of estrogen in postmenopausal women. Aromatase inhibitors decrease the production of estrogen in\nthese women.\n1.  Anastrozole and letrozole\nAnastrozole [an-AS-troe-zole] and letrozole [LE-troe-zole] are nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors. These agents are\nconsidered first-line drugs for the treatment of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. They are orally active and\ncause almost a total suppression of estrogen synthesis. Anastrozole and letrozole do not predispose patients to\nendometrial cancer. Both drugs are extensively metabolized in the liver, and metabolites and parent drug are\nexcreted primarily in the urine.\n2.  Exemestane\nA steroidal, irreversible inhibitor of aromatase, exemestane [ex-uh-MES-tane], is well absorbed after oral\nadministration and widely distributed. Hepatic metabolism occurs via the CYP3A4 isoenzyme. Because the\nmetabolites are excreted in urine, doses of the drug must be adjusted in patients with renal failure. Major toxicities\nare nausea, fatigue, and hot flashes. Alopecia and dermatitis have also been noted.\n1350\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1351 ---\n\nD.  Leuprolide, goserelin, and triptorelin\nGonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is normally secreted by the hypothalamus and stimulates the anterior\npituitary to secrete the gonadotropic hormones: 1) luteinizing hormone (LH), the primary stimulus for the secretion\nof testosterone by the testes, and 2) follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which stimulates the secretion of estrogen.\nLeuprolide [loo-PROE-lide], goserelin [GOE-se-rel-in], and triptorelin [TRIP-to-rel-in] are synthetic analogs of\nGnRH. As GnRH analogs, they occupy the GnRH receptor in the pituitary, which leads to its desensitization and,\nconsequently, inhibition of release of FSH and LH. Thus, both androgen and estrogen synthesis are reduced (Figure\n35.26). Response to leuprolide in prostatic cancer is equivalent to that of orchiectomy with regression of tumor and\nrelief of bone pain. These drugs have some benefit in premenopausal women with advanced breast cancer and have\nlargely replaced estrogens in therapy for prostate cancer. Leuprolide is available as 1) a subcutaneous daily injection,\n2) a subcutaneous depot injection, or 3) an intramuscular depot injection to treat metastatic carcinoma of the\nprostate. Goserelin acetate is a subcutaneous implant, and triptorelin pamoate is injected intramuscularly. Levels of\nandrogen in prostate cancer patients may initially rise, but then fall to castration levels. The adverse effects of these\ndrugs, including impotence, hot flashes, and tumor flare, are minimal compared to those experienced with estrogen\ntreatment.\n1351\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1352 ---\n\n1352\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1353 ---\n\nFigure 35.26 Effects of some anticancer drugs on the endocrine system.

Antiandrogens\nFlutamide [FLOO-ta-mide], nilutamide [nye-LOO-ta-mide], bicalutamide [bye-ka-LOO-ta-mide], and enzalutamide\n[enz-a-LOO-ta-mide] are oral antiandrogens used in the treatment of prostate cancer. They compete with the natural\nhormone for binding to the androgen receptor and prevent its action in the prostate (see Figure 35.26). Adverse\neffects include gynecomastia, constipation, nausea, and abdominal pain. Rarely, liver failure has occurred with\nflutamide. Nilutamide can cause visual problems.\n1354\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1355 ---\n\nVIII.  Platinum Coordination Complexes\n1355\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1356 ---\n\nA.  Cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin\nCisplatin [SIS-pla-tin] was the first member of the platinum coordination complex class of anticancer drugs, but\nbecause of severe toxicity, carboplatin [KAR-boe-pla-tin] was developed. The potency, pharmacokinetics, patterns\nof distribution, and dose-limiting toxicities differ significantly ( Figure 35.27) between the two drugs. Cisplatin has\nsynergistic cytotoxicity with radiation and other chemotherapeutic agents. It has found wide application in the\ntreatment of solid tumors, such as metastatic testicular carcinoma in combination with VBL and bleomycin, ovarian\ncarcinoma in combination with cyclophosphamide, or alone for bladder carcinoma. Carboplatin is used when\npatients cannot be vigorously hydrated, as is required for cisplatin treatment, or if they suffer from kidney\ndysfunction or are prone to neuro- or ototoxicity. Oxaliplatin [ox-AL-ih-pla-tin] is a closely related analog of\ncarboplatin used in the setting of colorectal cancer.\nFigure 35.27 Summary of platinum coordination complexes. AUC = area under the\ncurve; CBC = complete blood count; CMP = complete metabolic panel; IA = intra-\narterially; IP = intraperitoneally; IV = intravenous; N = nausea; V = vomiting.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nThe mechanism of action for these agents is similar to that of the alkylating agents. In the high-chloride milieu of the\nplasma, cisplatin persists as the neutral species, which enters the cell and loses chloride in the low-chloride milieu. It\nthen binds to guanine in DNA, forming inter- and intrastrand cross-links. The resulting cytotoxic lesion inhibits both\npolymerases for DNA replication and RNA synthesis. Cytotoxicity can occur at any stage of the cell cycle, but cells\nare most vulnerable to the actions of these drugs in the G1 and S phases.\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\nThese agents are administered via IV infusion. Cisplatin and carboplatin can also be given intraperitoneally for\novarian cancer and intra-arterially to perfuse other organs. The highest concentrations of the drugs are found in the\nliver, kidney, and intestinal, testicular, and ovarian cells, but little penetrates into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The\nrenal route is the main pathway of excretion.\n3.  Adverse effects\nSevere nausea and vomiting occurs in most patients after administration of cisplatin and may continue for as long as\n5 days. Premedication with antiemetic agents is required. The major limiting toxicity is dose-related nephrotoxicity,\ninvolving the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts. This can be prevented by aggressive hydration. Other\ntoxicities include ototoxicity with high-frequency hearing loss and tinnitus. Unlike cisplatin, carboplatin causes only\nmild nausea and vomiting, and it is rarely nephro-, neuro-, or ototoxic. The dose-limiting toxicity is\nmyelosuppression. Oxaliplatin has a distinct adverse effect of cold-induced peripheral neuropathy that usually\nresolves within 72 hours of administration. It also causes myelosuppression and cumulative peripheral neuropathy.\nHepatotoxicity has also been reported. These agents may cause hypersensitivity reactions ranging from skin rashes\nto anaphylaxis.\n1356\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1357 ---\n\nIX.  Topoisomerase Inhibitors\nThese agents exert their mechanism of action via inhibition of topoisomerase enzymes, a class of enzymes that\nreduce supercoiling of DNA (Figure 35.28).\nFigure 35.28 Summary of topoisomerase inhibitors. CBC = complete blood count; IV =\nintravenous; N = nausea; PO = oral administration; V = vomiting.\n1357\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1358 ---\n\nA.  Camptothecins\nCamptothecins are plant alkaloids originally isolated from the Chinese tree Camptotheca. Irinotecan [eye-rin-oh-\nTEE-kan] and topotecan [toe-poe-TEE-kan] are semisynthetic derivatives of camptothecin [camp-toe-THEE-sin].\nTopotecan is used in metastatic ovarian cancer when primary therapy has failed and also in the treatment of small\ncell lung cancer. Irinotecan is used with 5-FU and leucovorin for the treatment of colorectal carcinoma.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nThese drugs are S-phase specific and inhibit topoisomerase I, which is essential for the replication of DNA in human\ncells (Figure 35.29). SN-38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan) is approximately 1000 times as potent as irinotecan\nas an inhibitor of topoisomerase I. The topoisomerases relieve torsional strain in DNA by causing reversible, single-\nstrand breaks.\n1358\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1359 ---\n\nFigure 35.29 Action of type I DNA topoisomerases.\n2.  Adverse effects\nBone marrow suppression, particularly neutropenia, is the dose-limiting toxicity for topotecan. Frequent blood\ncounts should be performed in patients receiving this drug. Myelosuppression is also seen with irinotecan. Acute\n1359\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1360 ---\n\nand delayed diarrhea with irinotecan may be severe and require treatment with atropine during the infusion or high\ndoses of loperamide in the days following the infusion.\n1360\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1361 ---\n\nB.  Etoposide\nEtoposide [e-toe-POE-side] is a semisynthetic derivative of the plant alkaloid, podophyllotoxin. This agent blocks\ncells in the late S to G2 phase of the cell cycle, and the major target is topoisomerase II. Binding of the drug to the\nenzyme–DNA complex results in persistence of the transient, cleavable form of the complex and, thus, renders it\nsusceptible to irreversible double-strand breaks (Figure 35.30). Etoposide finds its major clinical use in the treatment\nof lung cancer and in combination with bleomycin and cisplatin for testicular carcinoma. Etoposide may be\nadministered either IV or orally. Dose-limiting myelosuppression (primarily leukopenia) is the major toxicity.\nFigure 35.30 Mechanism of action of etoposide.\n1361\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1362 ---\n\n1362\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1363 ---\n\nX.  Antibodies\nMonoclonal antibodies (Figure 35.31) are an active area of drug development for anticancer therapy and other\nnonneoplastic diseases, because they are directed at specific targets and often have different adverse effect profiles\nas compared to traditional chemotherapy agents. [Note: Monoclonal antibodies also find application in a number of\nother disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis.] All of these agents are\nadministered intravenously, and infusion-related reactions are common.\nFigure 35.31 Summary of monoclonal antibodies. BP = blood pressure; CBC = complete\nblood count; EGFR = epidermal growth factor receptor; HER2 = human epidermal\ngrowth factor receptor protein 2; GI = gastrointestinal; LVEF = left ventricular ejection\nfraction; PML = progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy; TLS = tumor lysis\nsyndrome; VEGF = vascular endothelial growth factor.\n1363\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1364 ---\n\nXI.  Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors\nThe tyrosine kinases are a family of enzymes that are involved in several important processes within a cell,\nincluding signal transduction and cell division. [Note: At least 50 tyrosine kinases mediate cell growth or division by\nphosphorylation of signaling proteins. They have been implicated in the development of many neoplasms.] The\ntyrosine kinase inhibitors are administered orally, and these agents have a wide variety of applications in the\ntreatment of cancer (Figure 35.32).\nFigure 35.32 Summary of tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

Immunotherapy\nImmunotherapy with intravenous immune checkpoint inhibitors is a rapidly evolving option for cancer treatment.\nThe goal of immune checkpoint inhibitors is to block the checkpoint molecules, such as the programmed death (PD-\n1) receptor, that normally help to keep the immune system in check. By blocking these molecules, the immune\nsystem is better able to attack the tumor and cause destruction. The two most commonly used checkpoint inhibitors\nare pembrolizumab [PEM-broe-LIZ-ue-mab] and nivolumab [nye-VOL-ue-mab]. The adverse reaction profiles of\nthese agents consist of potentially severe and even fatal immune-mediated adverse events. This is because turning\noff the immune checkpoints allows attack of the tumor, but can also lead to unchecked autoimmune response to\nnormal tissues. Adverse events include diarrhea, colitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, nephritis, neurotoxicity,\ndermatologic toxicity in the form of severe skin rashes, and endocrinopathies such as hypo- or hyperthyroidism.\nPatients should be closely monitored for the potential development of signs and symptoms of toxicity and promptly\ntreated with corticosteroids if necessary.\n1365\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1366 ---\n\nXIII.  Miscellaneous Agents\n1366\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1367 ---\n\nA.  Abiraterone acetate\nAbiraterone [ab-er-AT-er-own] acetate is an oral agent used in the treatment of metastatic castration–resistant\nprostate cancer. Abiraterone acetate is used in conjunction with prednisone to inhibit the CYP17 enzyme (an\nenzyme required for androgen synthesis), resulting in reduced testosterone production. Coadministration with\nprednisone is required to help lessen the effects of mineralocorticoid excess resulting from CYP17 inhibition.\nHepatotoxicity may occur, and patients should be closely monitored for hypertension, hypokalemia, and fluid\nretention. Joint and muscle discomfort, hot flushes, and diarrhea are common adverse effects with this agent.\n1367\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1368 ---\n\nB.  Immunomodulating agents\nThalidomide [tha-LID-oh-mide], lenalidomide [LEN-a-LID-oh-mide], and pomalidomide [pom-a-LID-oh-mide] are\noral agents used in the treatment of multiple myeloma. Their exact mechanism of action is not clear, but they\npossess antimyeloma properties including antiangiogenic, immune-modulation, anti-inflammatory and\nantiproliferative effects. These agents are often combined with dexamethasone or other chemotherapeutic agents.\nAdverse effects include thromboembolism, myelosuppression, fatigue, rash, and constipation. Thalidomide was\npreviously given to pregnant women to prevent morning sickness. However, severe birth defects were prevalent in\nchildren born to mothers who used thalidomide. Because of their structurally similarities to thalidomide,\nlenalidomide and pomalidomide are contraindicated in pregnancy.\n1368\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1369 ---\n\nC.  Proteasome inhibitors\nBortezomib [bore-TEZ-o-mib], ixazomib [ix-az-O-mib], and carfilzomib [kar-FIL-zo-mib] are proteasome inhibitors\ncommonly used as the backbone therapy in the treatment of multiple myeloma. These agents work by inhibiting\nproteasomes, which in turn prevents the degradation of proapoptotic factors, thus leading to a promotion in\nprogrammed cell death (apoptosis). Malignant cells readily depend on suppression of the apoptotic pathway;\ntherefore, proteasome inhibition works well in multiple myeloma. Bortezomib can be administered IV, but the\nsubcutaneous route is preferred because it is associated with less neuropathy. Other adverse effects include\nmyelosuppression, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, and herpes zoster reactivation. Patients should receive antiviral\nprophylaxis if they are receiving therapy with bortezomib. Ixazomib is an oral agent with an adverse effect profile\nsimilar to bortezomib. Carfilzomib is administered intravenously, and common adverse effects include\nmyelosuppression, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, and fever.\n“Chemo Man” is a useful tool to help remember the most common toxicities of these drugs (Figure 35.33).\nFigure 35.33 Chemo Man—a summary of toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents.\n1369\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1370 ---\n\n35.1\n35.2\n35.3\n35.4\n35.5\n35.6Study Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nA patient is about to undergo three cycles of chemotherapy prior to surgery for bladder cancer. Which best\ndescribes chemotherapy in this setting?\nA.  Adjuvant\nB.  Neoadjuvant\nC.  Palliative\nD.  Maintenance\nCorrect answer = B. Chemotherapy given before the surgical procedure in an attempt to shrink the cancer is\nreferred to as neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is indicated when neoplasms are disseminated and are\nnot amenable to surgery (palliative). Chemotherapy is also used as a supplemental treatment to attack\nmicrometastases following surgery and radiation treatment, in which case it is called adjuvant chemotherapy.\nChemotherapy given in lower doses to assist in prolonging a remission is known as maintenance chemotherapy.\nA 45-year-old man is being treated with ABVD chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma. He presents for cycle\n4 of a planned 6 cycles with a new-onset cough. He states it started a week ago and he also feels like he has a\nlittle trouble catching his breath. Which drug in the ABVD regimen is the most likely cause of his pulmonary\ntoxicity?\nA.  Doxorubicin (Adriamycin)\nB.  Bleomycin\nC.  Vinblastine\nD.  Dacarbazine\nCorrect answer = B. Pulmonary toxicity is the most serious adverse effect of bleomycin, progressing from rales,\ncough, and infiltrate to potentially fatal fibrosis. The pulmonary fibrosis that is caused by bleomycin is often\nreferred as “bleomycin lung.”\nA patient is about to begin therapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Which test should be ordered\nfor baseline assessment before treatment?\nA.  Baseline PFTs\nB.  Baseline stress test\nC.  Baseline echocardiogram\nD.  Baseline urinalysis\nCorrect answer = C. Irreversible, dose-dependent cardiotoxicity, apparently a result of the generation of free\nradicals and lipid peroxidation, is the most serious adverse reaction of anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin.\nCardiac function should be assessed prior to therapy, and then periodically throughout therapy.\nA 64-year-old man is scheduled to undergo chemotherapy for rhabdomyosarcoma, and the regimen includes\nifosfamide. Which is most appropriate to include in chemotherapy orders for this patient?\nA.  IV hydration, mesna, and frequent urinalyses\nB.  Leucovorin and frequent urinalyses\nC.  Allopurinol and frequent urinalyses\nD.  IV hydration, prophylactic antibiotics, and frequent urinalyses\nCorrect answer = A. A unique toxicity of ifosfamide is hemorrhagic cystitis. This bladder toxicity has been\nattributed to toxic metabolites of ifosfamide. Adequate hydration as well as IV injection of mesna (sodium 2-\nmercaptoethane sulfonate), which neutralizes the toxic metabolites, can minimize this problem. Frequent\nurinalyses to monitor for red blood cells should be ordered. Leucovorin is used with methotrexate or 5-FU (not\nifosfamide). Allopurinol has a drug interaction with ifosfamide and is not an agent that prevents hemorrhagic\ncystitis. IV fluids are correct; however, mesna is also needed.\nDevelopment of signs of which condition should be monitored in patients receiving chemotherapy with\nifosfamide?\nA.  Hand-foot syndrome\nB.  Rash\nC.  Cardiotoxicity\nD.  Neurotoxicity\nCorrect answer = D. A fairly high incidence of neurotoxicity has been reported in patients on high-dose\nifosfamide, probably due to the metabolite, chloroacetaldehyde. Hand-foot syndrome is an adverse effect of 5-FU\nand derivatives. Rash is possible with many drugs, but is not the most appropriate answer here. Cardiotoxicity is\nan adverse effect of the anthracyclines.\nWhich chemotherapy drug can cause nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, electrolyte abnormalities,1370\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1371 ---\n\n35.7\n35.8\n35.9\n35.10and severe nausea and vomiting?\nA.  Cyclophosphamide\nB.  Oxaliplatin\nC.  Etoposide\nD.  Cisplatin\nCorrect answer = D. Cisplatin can cause renal failure, neuropathy, hearing loss, electrolyte wasting, and\nsignificant nausea and vomiting. Oxaliplatin rarely causes ototoxicity or nephrotoxicity. Cyclophosphamide and\netoposide have myelosuppression as the dose-limiting toxicity.\nA patient was mistakenly administered vincristine instead of cytarabine intrathecally.

Drug allergy.\nD.  Infusion reaction.\nCorrect answer = B. Patients undergoing therapy with an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor such\nas cetuximab often develop an acneiform-like rash on the face, chest, upper back, and arms. The appearance of\nsuch a rash has been correlated with an increased response as compared to patients who do not experience a rash\nduring therapy.\nWhich of the following should be administered prior to an infusion of the monoclonal antibody rituximab?\nA.  Allopurinol and acetaminophen.\nB.  Folic acid and H2 receptor antagonist.\nC.  Antihistamine and acetaminophen.\nD.  Hepatitis B vaccine and vitamin B12.\nCorrect answer = C. Patients receiving rituximab may experience an infusion reaction, usually on the first cycle.\nHypotension, bronchospasm, and angioedema may occur. Chills and fever may occur, especially in patients with\nhigh circulating levels of neoplastic cells, because of rapid activation of complement, which results in the release\nof tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukins. Pretreatment with diphenhydramine, acetaminophen, and\ncorticosteroids and a slower infusion rate can lessen the chance of this reaction.\nPatients should receive antiviral prophylaxis for herpes zoster while undergoing treatment with which agent\nfor multiple myeloma?\nA.  Dabrafenib\nB.  Ipilimumab\nC.  Cisplatin\nD.  Bortezomib\nCorrect answer = D. Bortezomib is known to cause herpes zoster reactivation in patients receiving treatment for\nmultiple myeloma. Patients should receive antiviral prophylaxis while on bortezomib therapy.1371\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1372 ---\n\n36\nImmunosuppressants\nJennifer Jebrock and Jane Revollo\n1372\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1373 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nThe importance of the immune system in protecting the body against harmful foreign molecules is well recognized.\nThe immune system is one of the most complex organ systems in the body, which can make it difficult to\nmanipulate. Immunosuppressants are drugs that reduce the activation or efficacy of the immune system to treat\ncertain conditions, such as autoimmune diseases, or to lower the body’s ability to reject a transplanted organ.\nAutoimmune diseases can arise when the immune system mistakenly identifies an individual’s own tissues as\nforeign and directs a destructive response against them. The goal of treatment for these diseases is to use drug\ntherapy to stop this inappropriate and harmful process. In the case of organ transplantation, foreign tissue is\npurposely implanted into the recipient, but the goal remains the same—to use drug therapy to limit the damage\ninflicted by the immune system and potential rejection of the transplanted organ. Transplantation of organs and\ntissues (for example, kidney, heart, or bone marrow) has become routine due to improved surgical techniques and\nbetter tissue typing. Available drugs now more selectively inhibit rejection of transplanted tissues while preventing\nthe patient from immunological compromise and prolonging the life of transplanted organs ( Figure 36.1). Earlier\ndrugs were nonselective, and patients frequently succumbed to infection due to suppression of both the antibody-\nmediated (humoral) and cell-mediated arms of the immune system. Today, the principal approach to\nimmunosuppressive therapy is to alter lymphocyte function using drugs or antibodies against immune proteins.\nBecause of their severe toxicities when used as monotherapy, a combination of immunosuppressive agents, usually\nat lower doses, is generally employed. Immunosuppressive drug regimens typically consist of two to four agents\nwith different mechanisms of action that disrupt various levels of T-cell activation. [Note: Although this chapter\nfocuses on immunosuppressive agents in the context of organ transplantation, these agents may be used in the\ntreatment of other disorders. For example, cyclosporine may be useful in the treatment of psoriasis, and various\nmonoclonal antibodies have applications in a number of disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis,\nCrohn disease, and ulcerative colitis.]\n1373\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1374 ---\n\nFigure 36.1 Immunosuppressant drugs. mTOR = mammalian target of rapamycin.\nThe immune activation cascade can be described as a three-signal model ( Figure 36.2). Signal 1 constitutes T-cell\ntriggering at the CD3 receptor complex by an antigen on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell (APC). Signal 1\nalone is insufficient for T-cell activation and requires signal 2. Signal 2, also referred to as costimulation, occurs\nwhen CD80 and CD86 (also known as B7.1 and B7.2) on the surface of APCs engage CD28 on T cells. Both signals\n1 and 2 activate several intracellular signal transduction pathways, one of which is the calcium–calcineurin pathway.\nThese pathways trigger the production of cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-2. IL-2 then binds to the IL-2 receptor\n(also known as CD25) on the surface of other T cells, thereby providing signal 3, activating the cell cycle via\nmammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and leading to T-cell proliferation.1374\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1375 ---\n\nFigure 36.2 Mechanism of action of immunosuppressive agents. IL-2 = interleukin 2;\nmRNA = messenger RNA; mTOR = mammalian target of rapamycin; NFAT = nuclear\nfactor of activated T cells; mRNA = messenger RNA cells.\nImmunosuppressants can be broadly categorized by their place in therapy and their mechanism of action. More\npotent immunosuppressant drugs, such as monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, are often used in induction therapy,\nwhich powerfully suppresses the immune system at the time of transplant, allowing the new organ to start\nfunctioning in the recipient and preventing early graft rejection. Maintenance immunosuppressant drugs, on the\nother hand, are less potent and provide long-term immunological protection for the transplanted organs, with lower\nrisk of infection than with the induction drugs. As noted above, maintenance immunosuppressant medications are\nfrequently combined in regimens to maintain adequate immunosuppression while minimizing adverse effects.\n1375\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1376 ---\n\nII.  Induction and Rejection Immunosuppressant Medications\nThe use of antibodies plays a central role in prolonging allograft survival. [Note: An allograft is a transplant of an\norgan or tissue from one person to another who is not genetically identical.] Antibodies are prepared by\nimmunization of either rabbits or horses with human lymphoid cells (producing a mixture of polyclonal antibodies\nor monoclonal antibodies) or by hybridoma technology (producing antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies).\nHybridomas are produced by fusing mouse antibody-producing cells with tumor cells. Hybrid cells are selected and\ncloned, and the antibody specificity of the clones is determined. Clones of interest can be cultured in large quantities\nto produce clinically useful amounts of the desired antibody. Recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) technology\ncan also be used to replace part of the mouse gene sequence with human genetic material, thus “humanizing” the\nantibodies and making them less antigenic. The names of monoclonal antibodies conventionally contain “xi” or “zu”\nif they are chimerized or humanized, respectively. The suffix “-mab” (monoclonal antibody) identifies the category\nof drug. The polyclonal antibodies, although relatively inexpensive to produce, are variable and less specific, which\nis in contrast to monoclonal antibodies, which are homogeneous and specific (Figure 36.3).\nFigure 36.3 Medications used for induction and/or rejection immunosuppressant therapy.\nCMV = cytomegalovirus; HLD = hyperlipidemia; HSV = herpes simplex virus; HTN =\nhypertension; IL = interleukin; PML = progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy; TNF\n= tumor necrosis factor.\n1376\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1377 ---\n\nA.  Antithymocyte globulins\nAntithymocyte globulins are polyclonal antibodies produced by isolating gamma-globulin fractions of serum\nobtained from rabbits or horses after immunization with human thymocytes. They cause depletion of circulating T\ncells and apoptosis of activated T cells. Rabbit preparations are preferred over horse preparations because of greater\npotency and less toxicity.\nAntithymocyte globulin (rabbit) is primarily used at the time of transplantation to prevent early allograft\nrejection, along with other immunosuppressive agents. It may also be used to treat severe rejection episodes or\ncorticosteroid-resistant acute rejection. It is usually used for 3 to 10 days to produce profound lymphopenia that may\nlast beyond 1 year.\nThe antibodies are slowly infused intravenously and their half-life extends from 3 to 9 days. Premedication with\ncorticosteroids, acetaminophen, and antihistamines may help reduce infusion-related reactions. Prolonged use may\nbe associated with profound immunosuppression and an increased risk of opportunistic infections and/or\nposttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD).\n1377\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1378 ---\n\nB.  Basiliximab\nBasiliximab [bass-il-IX-im-ab] is a chimeric murine/human monoclonal antibody that binds to the α chain of the IL-\n2 receptor (CD25) on activated T cells and, thus, interferes with the proliferation of these cells. Blockade of this\nreceptor foils the ability of any antigenic stimulus to activate the T-cell response system.\nBasiliximab is approved for prophylaxis of acute rejection in renal transplantation in combination with\ncyclosporine and corticosteroids. This may allow for reduced doses or delayed introduction of calcineurin inhibitors.\nThe drug may be beneficial in those with delayed graft function and may reduce the risk of calcineurin inhibitor–\nassociated renal toxicity. Basiliximab is not T-cell depleting and, therefore, is mainly used in induction protocols as\nopposed to the treatment of rejection. Basiliximab is given as an IV infusion. The serum half-life of basiliximab is\nabout 7 days. Usually, two doses of this drug are administered—the first at 2 hours prior to transplantation and the\nsecond at 4 days after the surgery. The drug is generally well tolerated.\n1378\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1379 ---\n\nC.  Alemtuzumab\nAlemtuzumab [AL-em-TOOZ-ue-mab] is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to CD52 on both T and B\ncells, resulting in depletion of both lymphoid cell lines. Depletion of T and B cells is observed soon after infusion\nand recovery of these cells is gradual. T cells recover over 6 to 12 months, and B cells recover in 6 months or less. It\nis approved for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but has been used in transplantation as an induction\nand antirejection agent for both acute cellular rejection and antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) due to its activity\nagainst both T and B cells. Because of the potent and prolonged immunosuppressive effect, it is recommended to\ninitiate or continue prophylaxis for Pneumocystis pneumonia and herpes viruses after administration of\nalemtuzumab.\nAlemtuzumab was removed from the US market by the manufacturer in 2012 in preparation for relabeling for\nuse in multiple sclerosis, but it can still be obtained through the Campath Distribution Program for use in transplant\npatients.\n1379\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1380 ---\n\nD.  Rituximab\nRituximab [ri-TUX-i-mab] is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against the antigen CD20 on pre-B cells, mature B\ncells, and memory B cells. Rituximab causes B-cell depletion by inducing B-cell lysis and blocking B-cell activation\nand eventual maturation to antibody-forming plasma cells. Existing plasma cells do not express the CD20 antigen\nand, therefore, are unaffected by rituximab. The drug is approved for use in the treatment of B-cell lymphomas,\nPTLD, and rheumatoid arthritis. The benefit of using rituximab in transplantation is for antibody removal, which has\nbeen utilized in ABO (blood type) incompatible transplants, desensitization protocols, and treatment of AMR.\nIntravenous administration of rituximab leads to rapid and sustained depletion of B lymphocytes, with B-cell\ncounts returning to normal within 9 to 12 months. Rituximab has a boxed warning for reactivation of JC virus\nleading to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which has been reported in the nontransplant\npopulation. Activation of hepatitis B infection has also been reported following treatment, and hepatitis serologies\nshould be monitored.\n1380\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1381 ---\n\nE.  Bortezomib\nAMR involves the production of high levels of antibodies by plasma cells, either newly made from B cells or from\nthose that existed prior to transplant. One mechanism to control AMR is to target antibody production by plasma\ncells. Bortezomib [bor-TEZ-oh-mib] is a proteasome inhibitor that leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of normal\nplasma cells, thereby decreasing antibody production in sensitized patients.\nBortezomib is approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma, but it has been adapted for use in the treatment\nof AMR in transplant patients. It can be administered via intravenous bolus or subcutaneous injection, so it has a low\npotential for infusion-related reactions. Bortezomib is metabolized primarily by cytochrome P450 enzymes and\nhepatic dysfunction has rarely been reported when multiple cycles are given.\n1381\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1382 ---\n\nF.  Intravenous immunoglobulin\nIntravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) contains immunoglobulins prepared by human plasma pooled from many\ndonors. It has an immunomodulatory effect and is often used for autoimmune diseases, pretransplant desensitization\nprotocols, and treatment of AMR. The immunomodulatory effects on T and B cells occur at high doses, and it is also\nused at lower doses to prevent infection by replacing immunoglobulins removed during plasmapheresis. The\nmechanism of action is not well defined, but high doses of IVIG appear to induce B-cell apoptosis and modulate B-\ncell signaling. It also inhibits binding of antibodies to the transplanted graft and activation of the complement\nsystem. The serum half-life of IVIG is about 3 to 4 weeks.\nAdverse effects of IVIG include headache, fever, chills, myalgias, and hypotension/hypertension, which can be\nreduced by slowing the infusion rate. Serious adverse effects are rare and can include aseptic meningitis, acute renal\nfailure, and thrombotic events.\n1382\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1383 ---\n\nIII.  Maintenance Immunosuppressant Medications\nMaintenance immunosuppressants are intended to provide adequate immunosuppression to prevent allograft\nrejection, while minimizing infection, malignancy, and drug-induced adverse effects. Often they are combined in\nregimens of two to four drugs, using medications with different mechanisms of action to minimize drug toxicity.\nThese drugs can be further divided into four main classes: 1) calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine and tacrolimus), 2)\ncostimulation blockers (belatacept ), 3) mTOR inhibitors (sirolimus and everolimus), and 4) antiproliferatives\n(mycophenolate and azathioprine) (Figure 36.4).\nFigure 36.4 Medications used for maintenance immunosuppressant therapy. DDI = drug–\ndrug interaction; GVHD = graft versus host disease; HLD = hyperlipidemia; HTN =\nhypertension; mTOR = mammalian target of rapamycin; RA = rheumatoid arthritis; SOT\n= solid organ transplant; TC = total cholesterol; TG = triglycerides.\n1383\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1384 ---\n\nA.  Calcineurin inhibitors\nCalcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine [sye-kloe-SPOR-een] and tacrolimus [tac-RO-li-mus] block signal transduction\nthrough the calcium–calcineurin pathway, activated downstream of signal 1, to impair T-cell activation. Calcineurin,\na calcium-dependent protein phosphatase, dephosphorylates nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), allowing\nNFAT to enter the T-cell nucleus and bind to DNA, leading to transcription and production of cytokines, including\nIL-2. Cyclosporine binds to cyclophilin, whereas tacrolimus binds a protein called FK-binding protein (FKBP).\nThese drug–protein complexes inhibit the activity of calcineurin, thereby preventing T-cell activation (see Figure\n36.2). Tacrolimus is the preferred calcineurin inhibitor due to its decreased rate of allograft rejection as compared to\ncyclosporine. Although it is approved for renal, liver, and heart transplant, tacrolimus is the mainstay of\nmaintenance immunosuppressants for all solid organ transplants.\nEnzymes CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and liver are\nresponsible for the interindividual variability in oral absorption and metabolism of cyclosporine and tacrolimus.\nDosing titration is based on 12-hour trough levels, with goal trough levels varying between different organs, time\nfrom transplant, and transplant center-specific protocols.\nOne of the primary limitations to the use of calcineurin inhibitors is nephrotoxicity, which has led to the\ndevelopment of regimens using these agents in combination with other immunosuppressant drugs. As with all\nimmunosuppressants, infections are possible with use of calcineurin inhibitors, and recipients are often given\nprophylactic medications posttransplant. Hirsutism, or excessive hair growth, is a common adverse effect of\ncyclosporine.\n1384\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1385 ---\n\nB.  Costimulation blocker\nBelatacept  [bel-a-TA-sept], a second-generation costimulation blocker, is a recombinant fusion protein of CTLA-4,\nwhich like CD28, binds to CD80 and CD86 on APCs. Binding of belatacept  to CD80 and CD86 prevents CD28\nfrom binding to those molecules and, thus, inhibits signal 2 of the T-cell activation pathway. Belatacept  is approved\nfor kidney transplantation in combination with basiliximab, mycophenolate mofetil , and corticosteroids. This drug\ncan substitute for calcineurin inhibitors to avoid the detrimental long-term nephrotoxic, cardiovascular, and\nmetabolic complications seen with cyclosporine and tacrolimus. [Note: The first-generation costimulation blocker\nabatacept  is approved for rheumatoid arthritis.]\nBelatacept  is the first IV maintenance immunosuppressant and is dosed in two phases. Initially, it is\nadministered four times in the first month at a higher dose to build up drug levels and then decreased to once-\nmonthly dosing. After 4 months, the dose is also decreased. Monthly dosing may be beneficial in patients for whom\nmedication compliance is an issue. Clearance of belatacept  is not affected by age, sex, race, renal, or hepatic\nfunction. Belatacept  increases the risk of PTLD, particularly of the central nervous system. Therefore, it is\ncontraindicated in patients who are seronegative to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a common cause of PTLD.\nSerological titers to EBV are typically obtained to confirm exposure.\n1385\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1386 ---\n\nC.  mTOR inhibitors\nSirolimus [sih-RO-lih-mus] (also known as rapamycin) and everolimus [e-ve-RO-lih-mus] inhibit the protein\nmTOR, blocking the signal transduction pathway activated by signal 3. Progression into the cell cycle and T-cell\nproliferation is subsequently prevented (Figure 36.5). The mTOR inhibitors are commonly used in multidrug\nregimens, frequently to minimize the dose of calcineurin inhibitors and spare their nephrotoxic adverse effects.\nFigure 36.5 Mechanism of action of sirolimus and everolimus. FKBP = FK-binding\nprotein; IL = interleukin; mRNA = messenger RNA; mTOR = mammalian target of\nrapamycin.\nLike the calcineurin inhibitors, both sirolimus and everolimus are metabolized by CYP3A4, are substrates for P-gp,\nand are subject to numerous drug–drug interactions. Both agents require drug monitoring of trough concentrations to\n1386\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1387 ---\n\noptimize therapy. Sirolimus has a longer half-life than the calcineurin inhibitors or everolimus, and is dosed only\nonce daily, which may improve medication compliance. The antiproliferative action of sirolimus is also valuable in\ncardiology where sirolimus-coated stents are used to inhibit restenosis of the blood vessels by reducing proliferation\nof the endothelial cells. Everolimus is also used in oncology to treat many different types of cancer, including breast,\nrenal cell, and neuroendocrine tumors. However, the doses for tumor treatment are higher than those used in\ntransplantation.\n1387\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1388 ---\n\nD.  Antiproliferatives\nThe antiproliferatives azathioprine [ay-za-THYE-oh-preen] and mycophenolate [mye-koe-FEN-oh-late] block\nlymphocyte proliferation by inhibiting nucleic acid synthesis. Azathioprine, which was one of the first agents to\nachieve widespread use in organ transplantation, is a prodrug that is converted first to 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP ) and\nthen to the corresponding nucleotide analog, thioinosinic acid. The analog is incorporated into nucleic acid chains\nand blocks further elongation of the DNA. Mycophenolate is a potent, reversible, noncompetitive inhibitor of\ninosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, which blocks the de novo formation of guanosine monophosphate (Figure\n36.6). Because lymphocytes are unable to utilize the salvage pathway of nucleotide synthesis, mycophenolate\neffectively blocks T- and B-cell proliferation by eliminating de novo production of guanosine monophosphate.\nFigure 36.6 Mechanism of action of mycophenolate. IMP = inosine-5′-monophosphate;\nGMP = guanosine monophosphate.\nThese medications are used as adjunctive immunosuppressant agents, primarily with calcineurin inhibitors with or\nwithout corticosteroids. However, mycophenolate has largely replaced azathioprine in this role due to its improved\nsafety and efficacy profile. The main dose-limiting adverse effect of azathioprine is bone marrow suppression.\nAllopurinol  inhibits the metabolism of azathioprine, thereby enhancing the adverse effects of azathioprine. Thus,\nconcomitant use of allopurinol  requires a significant reduction in azathioprine dose.\nMycophenolate is available in two formulations—as a prodrug mycophenolate mofetil  and as an active drug\nmycophenolic acid. Mycophenolate mofetil  is rapidly hydrolyzed in the gastrointestinal tract to mycophenolic acid.\nGlucuronidation of mycophenolic acid in the liver produces an inactive metabolite, but enterohepatic recirculation\noccurs, prolonging the effect of the drug. Mycophenolic acid is an enteric-coated tablet designed to theoretically\nreduce the gastrointestinal upset commonly experienced with mycophenolate mofetil .\n1388\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1389 ---\n\nE.

        "content": "Chapter 26) were the first pharmacologic agents to be used as immunosuppressives, both in\ntransplantation and in various autoimmune disorders. They are still one of the mainstays for attenuating rejection\nepisodes. For transplantation, the most common agents are prednisone and methylprednisolone, whereas prednisone\nand prednisolone are used for autoimmune conditions. [Note: In transplantation, they are used in combination with\nagents described previously in this chapter.] The steroids are used to suppress acute rejection of solid organ\nallografts and in chronic graft versus host disease. In addition, they are effective against a wide variety of\nautoimmune conditions, including refractory rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, temporal arteritis,\nand asthma. The exact mechanism responsible for the immunosuppressive action of the corticosteroids is unclear.\nThe T lymphocytes are most affected. The steroids are able to rapidly reduce lymphocyte populations by lysis or\nredistribution. On entering cells, they bind to the glucocorticoid receptor. The complex passes into the nucleus and\nregulates the transcription of DNA. Among the genes affected are those involved in inflammatory responses. The\nuse of these agents is associated with numerous adverse effects. For example, they are diabetogenic and can cause\nhypercholesterolemia, cataracts, osteoporosis, and hypertension with prolonged use. Consequently, efforts are being\ndirected toward reducing or eliminating the use of steroids in the maintenance of allografts.\n1389\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1390 ---\n\n36.1\n36.2\n36.3\n36.4\n36.5\n36.6Study Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nA 45-year-old man who received a renal transplant 3 months ago and is being maintained on tacrolimus,\nprednisone, and mycophenolate mofetil is found to have increased creatinine levels and a kidney biopsy\nindicates severe rejection. Which course of therapy would be appropriate?\nA.  Increased dose of prednisone.\nB.  Treatment with rabbit antithymocyte globulin.\nC.  Treatment with sirolimus.\nD.  Treatment with azathioprine.\nCorrect answer = B. This patient is apparently undergoing an acute rejection of the kidney. The most effective\ntreatment would be administration of an antibody. Increasing the dose of prednisone may have some effect but\nwould not be enough to treat the rejection. Sirolimus is used prophylactically with cyclosporine to prevent renal\nrejection but is less effective when an episode is occurring. Azathioprine has no benefit over mycophenolate.\nWhich combination of immunosuppressive drugs should be avoided?\nA.  Basiliximab, belatacept, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone.\nB.  Tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone.\nC.  Tacrolimus, cyclosporine, and prednisone.\nD.  Tacrolimus, sirolimus, and prednisone.\nCorrect answer = C. Tacrolimus and cyclosporine are both calcineurin inhibitors and have the same mechanism of\naction. Immunosuppressive drug regimens should work synergistically at different places in the T-cell activation\ncascade. Additionally, cyclosporine and tacrolimus are both extremely nephrotoxic and when used together would\ncause harm to patients. All of the other combinations are reasonable.\nWhich drug used to prevent allograft rejection can cause hyperlipidemia?\nA.  Basiliximab\nB.  Belatacept\nC.  Mycophenolate mofetil\nD.  Sirolimus\nCorrect answer = D. Patients who are receiving sirolimus can develop elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels,\nwhich can be controlled by statin therapy. None of the other agents have this adverse effect.\nWhich drug specifically inhibits calcineurin in the activated T lymphocytes?\nA.  Basiliximab\nB.  Tacrolimus\nC.  Sirolimus\nCorrect answer = B. Tacrolimus binds to FKBP-12, which, in turn, inhibits calcineurin and interferes in the\ncascade of reactions that synthesize interleukin-2 (IL-2) and lead to T-lymphocyte proliferation. Although\nbasiliximab also interferes with T-lymphocyte proliferation, it does so by binding to the CD25 site on the IL-2\nreceptor. Sirolimus, while also binding to FKBP-12, does not inhibit calcineurin. Mycophenolate mofetil exerts\nits immunosuppressive action by inhibiting inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, thus depriving the cells of\nguanosine monophosphate, a key precursor of nucleic acids.\nAn 18-year-old woman who received a kidney transplant 6 months ago comes in to clinic complaining of\nfacial hair growth and does not want to take an immunosuppressant anymore. Which treatment option would\nbe the most appropriate to address her concerns?\nA.  Switch cyclosporine to tacrolimus.\nB.  Switch mycophenolate mofetil to sirolimus.\nC.  Stop prednisone and add methylprednisolone.\nD.  Switch mycophenolate mofetil to mycophenolic acid.\nCorrect answer = A. Hirsutism, or excessive hair growth, is a well-known adverse effect of cyclosporine. Many\npatients experience dark, coarse facial or body hair growth while taking cyclosporine. Switching cyclosporine to\ntacrolimus would eliminate this adverse effect and keep the patient on a calcineurin inhibitor that is effective in\npreventing rejection. Mycophenolate and prednisone are not known to cause hirsutism.\nWhich immunosuppressant medication avoids the need for therapeutic drug monitoring?\nA.  Cyclosporine\nB.  Tacrolimus\nC.  Mycophenolate mofetil\nD.  Sirolimus1390\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1391 ---\n\n36.7\n36.8\n36.9\n36.10Correct answer = C. Calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine and tacrolimus) and mTOR inhibitors (sirolimus and\neverolimus) require therapeutic drug monitoring in order to maximize efficacy (prevent rejection episodes) and\nminimize toxicity (adverse effects). Mycophenolate mofetil is the correct answer since there is no role for routine\nmonitoring with this medication.\nWhich clinical situation is least appropriate for immunosuppression with sirolimus?\nA.  A patient with primary renal failure.\nB.  A patient who has failed calcineurin inhibitors due to neurotoxicity.\nC.  A patient who is 6 months postliver transplant and the incision site is fully healed.\nD.  A patient with an abnormal lipid profile.\nCorrect answer = D. A patient with an abnormal lipid profile is a poor candidate for immunosuppression with\nsirolimus, since this medication is known to cause or exacerbate hyperlipidemia, particularly triglycerides and\ntotal cholesterol. A patient with primary renal failure would be a candidate for sirolimus, since it does not cause\nnephrotoxicity as calcineurin inhibitors do. It would be appropriate to switch a patient who has failed calcineurin\ninhibitors due to neurotoxicity to sirolimus for immunosuppression since it is not associated with that adverse\neffect. Sirolimus is known to impair wound healing, but a patient with a fully healed incision site could\nappropriately be placed on sirolimus.\nWhich statement is correct regarding the difference between induction immunosuppression (IS) and\nmaintenance IS?\nA.  Maintenance IS is less important than induction IS for long-term graft survival.\nB.  Induction IS is more intense than maintenance IS.\nC.  Maintenance IS includes lymphocyte-depleting antibodies, while induction IS does not.\nD.  Induction IS increases the risk of infection, while maintenance IS does not.\nCorrect answer = B. Induction IS is more intense than maintenance IS, as it provides IS during the intraoperative\nand early postoperative period to combat the body’s initial immune response to the transplanted graft. Both\nmaintenance and induction IS are important for the long-term survival of the graft. Lymphocyte-depleting\nantibodies are used as induction IS and not as maintenance. Although induction IS is more potent, all IS (both\ninduction and maintenance) can increase the risk of infection.\nA 39-year-old man is admitted 3 months after liver transplant with increased liver function tests. A liver\nbiopsy is performed and the results show acute rejection, severe. The team decides to start treatment with\nantithymocyte globulin, rabbit. What additional drug therapy is required for appropriate administration of\nthis medication?\nA.  No additional medications are required.\nB.  Diphenhydramine, acetaminophen.\nC.  Diphenhydramine, ketorolac, corticosteroids.\nD.  Diphenhydramine, acetaminophen, corticosteroids.\nCorrect answer = D. Infusion-related reactions are common with the administration of antithymocyte globulins\ndue to cytokine release. Common symptoms include chills, fever, hypotension, and pulmonary edema.\nPremedication with acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, and corticosteroids should be administered 30 minutes\nprior to the start of the infusion to prevent this syndrome. Although diphenhydramine and acetaminophen are\ncorrect, corticosteroids are also needed as premedication. Ketorolac is not the most appropriate for use as\npremedication for antithymocyte globulin.\nA 21-year-old woman is admitted to receive a kidney transplant from her father. Since she has a low-to-\nmoderate risk of rejection, she will receive induction with the antibody basiliximab. Which statement\nindicates the uniqueness of the therapy she is receiving compared with other antibody agents?\nA.  Basiliximab is generally well tolerated and does not require premedications prior to administration.\nB.  Basiliximab binds to CD52 and targets B and T lymphocytes.\nC.  Basiliximab is used only in combination with antithymocyte globulin.\nD.  Basiliximab targets B cells, not T cells.\nCorrect answer = A. Basiliximab does not require premedication since it is a nondepleting agent and would not be\nexpected to cause cytokine release or infusion reactions. It can be used in combination with antithymocyte\nglobulin, but most commonly it is used alone. Basiliximab binds to CD25 (not CD52) and affects T cells. It does\nnot have any effect on B cells.1391\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1392 ---\n\nUNIT VII\nSpecial Topics in Pharmacology\n1392\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1393 ---\n\n37\nHistamine and Serotonin\nNancy Borja-Hart and Carol Motycka\n1393\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1394 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nHistamine and serotonin, along with prostaglandins, belong to a group of endogenous compounds called autacoids.\nThese heterogeneous substances have widely differing structures and pharmacologic activities. They all have the\ncommon feature of being formed by the tissues on which they act and, therefore, function as local hormones. [Note:\nThe word “autacoid” comes from the Greek: autos (self) and akos (medicinal agent, or remedy).] The autacoids also\ndiffer from circulating hormones in that they are produced by many tissues rather than in specific endocrine glands.\nThe drugs described in this chapter are either autacoids or autacoid antagonists (compounds that inhibit the synthesis\nof certain autacoids or that interfere with their interactions with receptors).\n1394\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1395 ---\n\nII.  Histamine\nHistamine is a chemical messenger mostly generated in mast cells. Histamine, via multiple receptor systems,\nmediates a wide range of cellular responses, including allergic and inflammatory reactions, gastric acid secretion,\nand neurotransmission in parts of the brain. Histamine has no clinical applications, but agents that inhibit the action\nof histamine (antihistamines or histamine receptor blockers) have important therapeutic applications. Figure 37.1\nprovides a summary of the antihistamines.\nFigure 37.1 Summary of antihistamines.\n1395\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1396 ---\n\n1396\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1397 ---\n\nA.  Location, synthesis, and release of histamine\n1.  Location\nHistamine is present in practically all tissues, with significant amounts in the lungs, skin, blood vessels, and\ngastrointestinal (GI) tract. It is found in high concentrations in mast cells and basophils. Histamine functions as a\nneurotransmitter in the brain. It also occurs as a component of venoms and in secretions from insect stings.\n2.  Synthesis\nHistamine is an amine formed by the decarboxylation of the amino acid histidine by the enzyme histidine\ndecarboxylase, which is expressed in cells throughout the body, including neurons, gastric parietal cells, mast cells,\nand basophils (Figure 37.2). In mast cells, histamine is stored in granules. If histamine is not stored, it is rapidly\ninactivated by the enzyme amine oxidase.\nFigure 37.2 Biosynthesis of histamine.\n3.  Release of histamine\nMost often, histamine is just one of several chemical mediators released in response to stimuli. The stimuli for\nrelease of histamine from tissues may include destruction of cells as a result of cold, toxins from organisms, venoms\nfrom insects and spiders, and trauma. Allergies and anaphylaxis can also trigger significant release of histamine.\n1397\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1398 ---\n\nB.  Mechanism of action\nHistamine released in response to certain stimuli exerts its effects by binding to various types of histamine receptors\n(H1, H2, H3, and H4). H1 and H2 receptors are widely expressed and are the targets of clinically useful drugs.\nHistamine has a wide range of pharmacologic effects that are mediated by both H1 and H2 receptors. For example,\nthe H1 receptors are important in producing smooth muscle contraction and increasing capillary permeability ( Figure\n37.3). Histamine promotes vasodilation of small blood vessels by causing the vascular endothelium to release nitric\noxide. In addition, histamine can enhance the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in several cell types and in\nlocal tissues. Histamine H1 receptors mediate many pathological processes, including allergic rhinitis, atopic\ndermatitis, conjunctivitis, urticaria, bronchoconstriction, asthma, and anaphylaxis. Moreover, histamine stimulates\nthe parietal cells in the stomach, causing an increase in acid secretion via the activation of H2 receptors.\n1398\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1399 ---\n\n1399\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1400 ---\n\nFigure 37.3 Actions of histamine.\n1400\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1401 ---\n\nC.  Role in allergy and anaphylaxis\nThe symptoms resulting from intravenous injection of histamine are similar to those associated with anaphylactic\nshock and allergic reactions. These include contraction of airway smooth muscle, stimulation of secretions, dilation\nand increased permeability of the capillaries, and stimulation of sensory nerve endings. Symptoms associated with\nallergy and anaphylactic shock result from the release of certain mediators from their storage sites. Such mediators\ninclude histamine, serotonin, leukotrienes, and the eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis. In some cases,\nthese mediators cause a localized allergic reaction, producing, for example, actions on the skin or respiratory tract.\nUnder other conditions, these mediators may cause a full-blown anaphylactic response. It is thought that the\ndifference between these two situations results from differences in the sites from which mediators are released and\nin their rates of release. For example, if the release of histamine is slow enough to permit its inactivation before it\nenters the bloodstream, a local allergic reaction results. However, if histamine release is too fast for efficient\ninactivation, a full-blown anaphylactic reaction occurs.\n1401\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1402 ---\n\nIII.  H 1 Antihistamines\nThe term antihistamine refers primarily to the classic H1-receptor blockers. The H1-receptor blockers can be divided\ninto first- and second-generation drugs (Figure 37.4). The older first-generation drugs are still widely used because\nthey are effective and inexpensive. However, most of these drugs penetrate the central nervous system (CNS) and\ncause sedation. Furthermore, they tend to interact with other receptors, producing a variety of unwanted adverse\neffects. By contrast, the second-generation agents are specific for peripheral H1 receptors. The second-generation\nantihistamines are made polar, mainly by adding carboxyl groups (for example, cetirizine is the carboxylated\nderivative of hydroxyzine), and, therefore, these agents do not penetrate the blood–brain barrier and cause less CNS\ndepression than do the first-generation drugs. Among the second-generation agents, desloratadine [des-lor-AH-tah-\ndeen], fexofenadine [fex-oh-FEN-a-deen], and loratadine [lor-AT-a-deen] show the least sedation (Figure 37.5).\nCetirizine [seh-TEER-ih-zeen] and levocetirizine [lee-voe-seh-TEER-ih-zeen] are partially sedating second-\ngeneration agents.\n1402\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1403 ---\n\nFigure 37.4 Summary of therapeutic advantages and disadvantages of some H1 histamine\nreceptor–blocking agents.\n1403\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1404 ---\n\nFigure 37.5 Relative potential for causing drowsiness in patients receiving second-\ngeneration H1 antihistamines.\n1404\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1405 ---\n\nA.  Actions\nThe action of all H1-receptor blockers is qualitatively similar. Most of these compounds do not influence the\nformation or release of histamine. Rather, they block the receptor-mediated response of a target tissue. They are\nmuch more effective in preventing symptoms than reversing them once they have occurred. However, most of these\nagents have additional effects unrelated to their ability to block H1 receptors. These effects reflect binding of the H1-\nreceptor antagonists to cholinergic, adrenergic, or serotonin receptors (Figure 37.6). For example, cyproheptadine\n[SYE-proe-HEP-ta-deen] also acts as a serotonin antagonist on the appetite center, resulting in appetite stimulation.\nAntihistamines such as azelastine [a-ZEL-uh-steen] and ketotifen [kee-toe-TYE-fen] also have mast cell–stabilizing\neffects in addition to their histamine receptor–blocking effects.\nFigure 37.6 Effects of H1 antihistamines at histamine, adrenergic, cholinergic, and\nserotonin-binding receptors. CNS = central nervous system.\n1405\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1406 ---\n\nB.  Therapeutic uses\n1.  Allergic and inflammatory conditions\nH1-receptor blockers are useful in treating and preventing allergic reactions caused by antigens acting on\nimmunoglobulin E antibody. For example, oral antihistamines are the drugs of choice in controlling the symptoms\nof allergic rhinitis and urticaria because histamine is the principal mediator released by mast cells. Ophthalmic\nantihistamines, such as azelastine, olopatadine [oh-loe-PAT-a-deen], ketotifen, and others, are useful for the\ntreatment of allergic conjunctivitis. However, the H1-receptor blockers are not indicated in treating bronchial\nasthma, because histamine is only one of several mediators that are responsible for causing bronchial reactions.\n[Note: Epinephrine has actions on smooth muscle that are opposite to those of histamine. It acts via β2 receptors on\nsmooth muscle, causing cAMP-mediated relaxation. Therefore, epinephrine is the drug of choice in treating\nsystemic anaphylaxis and other conditions that involve massive release of histamine.]\n2.  Motion sickness and nausea\nAlong with the antimuscarinic agent scopolamine, certain H1-receptor blockers, such as diphenhydramine [dye-fen-\nHYE-dra-meen], dimenhydrinate [dye-men-HYE-dri-nate] (a chemical combination of diphenhydramine and a\nchlorinated theophylline derivative), cyclizine [SYE-kli-zeen], meclizine [MEK-li-zeen], and promethazine [proe-\nMETH-a-zeen], are the most effective agents for prevention of the symptoms of motion sickness. They are usually\nnot effective if symptoms are already present and, thus, should be taken prior to expected travel. The antihistamines\nprevent or diminish nausea and vomiting mediated by both the chemoreceptor and vestibular pathways. The\nantiemetic action of these medications seems to be due to their blockade of central H1 and M1 muscarinic receptors.\nMeclizine is also useful for the treatment of vertigo associated with vestibular disorders.\n3.  Insomnia\nAlthough they are not the medications of choice, many first-generation antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine and\ndoxylamine [dox-IL-a-meen], have strong sedative properties and are used in the treatment of insomnia. The use of\nfirst-generation H1 antihistamines is contraindicated in the treatment of individuals working in jobs in which\nwakefulness is critical. The second-generation antihistamines have no value as somnifacients.\n1406\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1407 ---\n\nC.  Pharmacokinetics\nH1-receptor blockers are well absorbed after oral administration, with maximum serum levels occurring at 1 to 2\nhours. The average plasma half-life is 4 to 6 hours, except for that of meclizine and the second-generation agents,\nwhich is 12 to 24 hours, allowing for once-daily dosing. First-generation H1-receptor blockers are distributed in all\ntissues, including the CNS. All first-generation H1 antihistamines and some second-generation H1 antihistamines,\nsuch as desloratadine and loratadine, are metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 system. Levocetirizine is the\nactive enantiomer of cetirizine. Cetirizine and levocetirizine are excreted largely unchanged in urine, and\nfexofenadine is excreted largely unchanged in feces. After a single oral dose, the onset of action occurs within 1 to 3\nhours. Azelastine, olopatadine, ketotifen, alcaftadine [al-KAF-ta-deen], bepotastine [bep-oh-TAS-teen], and\nemedastine [em-e-DAS-teen] are available in ophthalmic formulations that allow for more targeted tissue delivery.\nAzelastine and olopatadine have intranasal formulations, as well.\n1407\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1408 ---\n\nD.  Adverse effects\nFirst-generation H1-receptor blockers have a low specificity, interacting not only with histamine receptors but also\nwith muscarinic cholinergic receptors, α-adrenergic receptors, and serotonin receptors ( Figure 37.6). The extent of\ninteraction with these receptors and, as a result, the nature of the side effects varies with the structure of the drug.\nSome side effects may be undesirable, and others may be of therapeutic value. Furthermore, the incidence and\nseverity of adverse reactions for a given drug varies between individual subjects.\n1.  Sedation\nFirst-generation H1 antihistamines, such as chlorpheniramine [klor-fen-IR-a-meen], diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine\n[hye-DROX-ee-zeen], and promethazine, bind to H1 receptors and block the neurotransmitter effect of histamine in\nthe CNS. The most frequently observed adverse reaction is sedation (Figure 37.7); however, diphenhydramine may\ncause paradoxical hyperactivity in young children. Other central actions include fatigue, dizziness, lack of\ncoordination, and tremors. Elderly patients are more sensitive to these effects. Sedation is less common with the\nsecond-generation drugs, since they do not readily enter the CNS. Second-generation H1 antihistamines are specific\nfor peripheral H1 receptors.\n1408\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1409 ---\n\n1409\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1410 ---\n\nFigure 37.7 Some adverse effects observed with antihistamines. BP = blood pressure.\n2.  Other effects\nFirst-generation antihistamines exert anticholinergic effects, leading to dryness in the nasal passage and oral cavity.\nThey also may cause blurred vision and retention of urine. The most common adverse reaction associated with\nsecond-generation antihistamines is headache. Topical formulations of diphenhydramine can cause local\nhypersensitivity reactions such as contact dermatitis.\n3.  Drug interactions\nInteraction of H1-receptor blockers with other drugs can cause serious consequences, such as potentiation of effects\nof other CNS depressants, including alcohol. Patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), for example\nphenelzine, should not take antihistamines because the MAOIs can exacerbate the sedative and anticholinergic\neffects of antihistamines. In addition, the first-generation antihistamines (diphenhydramine and others) with\nanticholinergic (antimuscarinic) actions may decrease the effectiveness of cholinesterase inhibitors ( donepezil ,\nrivastigmine, and galantamine) in the treatment of Alzheimer disease.\n4.  Overdoses\nAlthough the margin of safety of H1-receptor blockers is relatively high and chronic toxicity is rare, acute poisoning\nis relatively common, especially in young children. The most common and dangerous effects of acute poisoning are\nthose on the CNS, including hallucinations, excitement, ataxia, and convulsions. If untreated, the patient may\nexperience a deepening coma and collapse of the cardiorespiratory system.\n1410\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1411 ---\n\nIV.  Histamine H 2-Receptor Blockers\nHistamine H2-receptor blockers have little, if any, affinity for H1 receptors. Although antagonists of the histamine\nH2 receptor (H2 antagonists or H2-receptor blockers) block the actions of histamine at all H2 receptors, their chief\nclinical use is as inhibitors of gastric acid secretion in the treatment of ulcers and heartburn. The H2-receptor\nblockers cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine, and nizatidine are discussed in",

        "content": "Chapter 40.\n1411\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1412 ---\n\nV.  Serotonin\nSerotonin is a neurotransmitter within the enteric nervous system and the CNS. It plays a role in vasoconstriction,\ninhibition of gastric secretion, and stimulation of smooth muscle contraction. Within the GI tract, it may serve as a\nlocal hormone to influence GI motility and secretion. Within the brain, the serotonergic neurons affect mood,\nappetite, body temperature regulation, and sleep. While serotonin has no therapeutic uses, selective serotonin\nagonists find clinical utility in the management of several disorders, such as depression and migraine headache.\n1412\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1413 ---\n\nA.  Location, synthesis, and release of serotonin\n1.  Location\nSerotonin is largely present within the enterochromaffin cells of the gastrointestinal tract. It is also found in storage\ngranules in platelets and the raphe nuclei of the brainstem.\n2.  Synthesis\nSerotonin (also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is synthesized from the amino acid L-tryptophan. L-\nTryptophan undergoes hydroxylation of the indole ring to form L-5-hydroxytryptophan, followed by decarboxylation\nto form 5-hydroxytryptamine.\n3.  Release of serotonin\nFollowing synthesis, serotonin is stored in vesicles and is released by exocytosis of the vesicle in response to an\naction potential. The activity of serotonin is terminated by uptake into the neuron and platelets. Metabolism occurs\nmainly via monoamine oxidase.\n1413\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1414 ---\n\nB.  Mechanism of action\nThere are seven families of 5-HT receptors, designated by numeric subscripts 1 through 7. Most of these are G\nprotein–coupled receptors, while the 5-HT3 receptor is a ligand-gated cation channel. The 5-HT1 and 5-HT2\nreceptors have several subtypes denoted by letters (for example, 5-HT2C). Serotonin has a wide range of effects that\nare mediated by the different types of serotonin receptors. For example, serotonin activity at 5-HT2C receptors in the\nCNS may cause a reduction in appetite, and stimulation of 5-HT3 receptors in the GI tract and vomiting center may\ntrigger emesis.

Drugs Used to Treat Headache Disorders\nThe most common types of headaches are migraine, tension-type, and cluster headaches. Migraines can usually be\ndistinguished from cluster headaches and tension-type headaches by the characteristics as shown in Figure 37.8.\nPatients with severe migraine headaches report one to five attacks per month of moderate to severe pain, which is\nusually unilateral. Headache disorders significantly affect quality of life and result in considerable health care costs.\nManagement of headaches involves avoidance of headache triggers (for example, alcohol, chocolate, and stress) and\nuse of abortive treatments for acute headaches, as well as prophylactic therapy in patients with frequent or severe\nmigraines (Figure 37.9). Serotonin agonists (triptans and ergot alkaloids) are effective as abortive agents in the\ntreatment of migraines.\nFigure 37.8 Characteristics of migraine, cluster, and tension-type headaches.\n1416\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1417 ---\n\nFigure 37.9 Summary of drugs used to treat migraine headache.\n1417\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1418 ---\n\nA.  Types of migraine\nThere are two main types of migraine headaches. The first, migraine without aura, is a severe, unilateral, pulsating\nheadache that typically lasts from 2 to 72 hours. These headaches are often aggravated by physical activity and are\naccompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia (hypersensitivity to light), and phonophobia (hypersensitivity to\nsound). The majority of patients with migraine do not have aura. In the second type, migraine with aura, the\nheadache is preceded by neurologic symptoms called auras, which can be visual, sensory, and/or cause speech or\nmotor disturbances. Most commonly, these prodromal symptoms are visual (flashes, zigzag lines, and glare) and\noccur approximately 20 to 40 minutes before headache pain begins. In the 15% of migraine patients whose headache\nis preceded by an aura, the aura itself allows diagnosis. The headache in migraines with or without auras is similar.\nWomen are threefold more likely than are men to experience either type of migraine.\n1418\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1419 ---\n\nB.  Biologic basis of migraine headaches\nThe first manifestation of migraine with aura is a spreading depression of neuronal activity accompanied by reduced\nblood flow in the most posterior part of the cerebral hemisphere. This hypoperfusion gradually spreads forward over\nthe surface of the cortex to other contiguous areas of the brain. The vascular alteration is accompanied by functional\nchanges. The hypoperfusion persists throughout the aura and well into the headache phase. Patients who have\nmigraine without aura do not show hypoperfusion. However, the pain of both types of migraine may be due to\nextracranial and intracranial arterial vasodilation, which leads to release of neuroactive molecules, such as substance\nP, neurokinin A, and calcitonin gene–related peptide.\n1419\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1420 ---\n\nC.  Symptomatic treatment of acute migraine\nAcute treatments can be classified as nonspecific (symptomatic) or migraine specific. Nonspecific treatment\nincludes analgesics such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antiemetics (for example,\nprochlorperazine) to control vomiting. Opioids are reserved as rescue medication when other treatments for a severe\nmigraine are not successful. Migraine-specific therapy includes triptans and ergot alkaloids, which are 5-HT1B/1D\nreceptor and 5-HT1D receptor agonists, respectively. It has been proposed that activation of 5-HT1 receptors by these\nagents leads either to vasoconstriction or to inhibition of the release of proinflammatory neuropeptides on the\ntrigeminal nerve innervating cranial blood vessels.\n1.  Triptans\nThis class of drugs includes almotriptan [al-moe-TRIP-tan], eletriptan [el-e-TRIP-tan], frovatriptan [froe-va-TRIP-\ntan], naratriptan [nar-a-TRIP-tan], rizatriptan [rye-za-TRIP-tan], sumatriptan [soo-ma-TRIP-tan], and zolmitriptan\n[zole-ma-TRIP-tan]. Sumatriptan was the first available triptan, and is the prototype of this class. These agents\nrapidly and effectively abort or markedly reduce the severity of migraine headaches in about 70% of patients. The\ntriptans are serotonin agonists, acting at a subgroup of serotonin receptors found on small peripheral nerves that\ninnervate the intracranial vasculature. The nausea that occurs with dihydroergotamine and the vasoconstriction\ncaused by ergotamine (see below) are much less pronounced with the triptans. Sumatriptan is given subcutaneously,\nintranasally, or orally (sumatriptan is also available in a combination product with naproxen). Zolmitriptan is\navailable orally and by nasal spray. All other agents are taken orally. The onset of the parenteral drug sumatriptan is\nabout 20 minutes, compared with 1 to 2 hours when the drug is administered orally. The drug has a short duration of\naction, with an elimination half-life of 2 hours. Headache commonly recurs within 24 to 48 hours after a single dose\nof drug, but in most patients, a second dose is effective in aborting the headache. Frovatriptan is the longest-acting\ntriptan, with a half-life of more than 24 hours. Individual response to triptans varies, and a trial of more than one\ntriptan may be necessary before treatment is successful. Elevation of blood pressure and other cardiac events have\nbeen reported with triptan use. Therefore, triptans should not be administered to patients with risk factors for\ncoronary artery disease without performing a cardiac evaluation prior to administration. Other adverse events with\nthe use of triptans include pain and pressure sensations in the chest, neck, throat, and jaw. Dizziness and malaise\nhave also been seen with the use of triptans.\n2.  Ergot alkaloids\nErgotamine [er-GOT-a-meen] and dihydroergotamine [dye-hye-droe-er-GOT-a-meen], a semisynthetic derivative of\nergotamine, are ergot alkaloids approved for the treatment of migraine headaches. The action of the ergot alkaloids\nis complex, with ability to bind to 5-HT1 receptors, α receptors, and dopamine receptors. 5-HT1 receptors located on\nintracranial blood vessels are targets that cause vasoconstriction with the use of these agents. Ergotamine is\ncurrently available sublingually and is mostly effective when used in the early stages of the migraine. It is also\navailable as an oral tablet or suppository containing both ergotamine and caffeine. Ergotamine is used with strict\ndaily and weekly dosage limits due to its ability to cause dependence and rebound headaches. Dihydroergotamine is\nadministered intravenously or intranasally and has an efficacy similar to that of sumatriptan. The use of\ndihydroergotamine is limited to severe cases of migraines. Nausea is a common adverse effect. Ergotamine and\ndihydroergotamine are contraindicated in patients with angina and peripheral vascular disease because they are\nsignificant vasoconstrictors.\n3.  Nonspecific therapies\nOther therapies for acute migraine attacks include analgesics, antiemetics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and\ncorticosteroids.\n1420\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1421 ---\n\nD.  Prophylaxis for migraine headache\nTherapy to prevent migraine is indicated if the attacks occur two or more times a month and if the headaches are\nsevere or complicated by serious neurologic signs. β-Blockers are the drugs of choice for migraine prophylaxis;\nhowever, calcium channel blockers, anticonvulsants (topiramate and divalproex), and tricyclic antidepressants have\nalso shown effectiveness in migraine prevention (Figure 37.10).\nFigure 37.10 Drugs useful in the treatment and prophylaxis of migraine headaches.\n1421\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1422 ---\n\nE.  Drugs for tension and cluster headache\nAnalgesics (NSAIDS, acetaminophen, aspirin) are used for symptom relief of tension headaches, and caffeine and\nbutalbital  are often combined with acetaminophen or aspirin. Triptans, along with inhalation of 100% oxygen, are\nused as first-line abortive strategies for cluster headache.\n1422\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1423 ---\n\nVII.  Drugs for Obesity\nThe term “obesity” is given to individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or greater. Obesity is due in\npart to an energy imbalance; however, it is now well understood that genetics, metabolism, behavior, environment,\nculture, and socioeconomic status play a role in obesity, as well. Serotonin agonists have been used in the treatment\nof obesity for the appetite suppression that they produce. Drugs for obesity are considered effective if they\ndemonstrate at least a 5% greater reduction in body weight as compared to placebo (no treatment). The majority of\ndrugs approved to treat obesity have short-term indications for usage. A summary of medications for obesity is\nprovided in Figure 37.11.\nFigure 37.11 Summary of drugs used in the treatment of obesity.\n1423\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1424 ---\n\nA.  Serotonin agonists\nThe first serotonin agonists used for weight loss, fenfluramine and dexflenfluramine, were withdrawn from the\nmarket following an increase in potentially fatal adverse effects, including valvulopathy. Valvulopathy, which may\nlead to pulmonary hypertension, is linked to 5-HT2B receptors. Lorcaserin [lor-KAS-er-in] is a serotonin agonist\nwith selectivity for the 5-HT2C serotonin receptor. In contrast to many other weight loss drugs, it is used for chronic\nweight management.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nLorcaserin selectively activates 5-HT2C receptors, which are almost exclusively found in the central nervous system.\nThis activation, in turn, stimulates proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons, which activate melanocortin receptors,\nthereby causing a decrease in appetite (Figure 37.12). If a patient does not lose at least 5% of his or her body weight\nafter 12 weeks of use, the drug should be discontinued.\nFigure 37.12 Lorcaserin mechanism of action. POMC = proopiomelanocortin.\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\nLorcaserin is extensively metabolized in the liver to two inactive metabolites that are then eliminated in the urine.\nLorcaserin has not been studied for use in severe hepatic impairment and is not recommended in severe renal\nimpairment.\n3.  Adverse effects\nThe most common adverse effects observed with lorcaserin are nausea, headache, dry mouth, dizziness,\nconstipation, and lethargy. Although rare, mood changes and suicidal ideation can occur. The development of life-\nthreatening serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome has been reported with the use of serotonin\nagonists. Therefore, patients should be monitored for the emergence of these conditions while on lorcaserin.\nBecause of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, concomitant use of lorcaserin with selective serotonin\nreuptake inhibitors, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, MAOIs, or other serotonergic drugs should be\navoided. As mentioned above, valvulopathy has been associated with the use of 5-HT2B receptor agonists. Although\nthe incidence of valvulopathy was not significantly increased in studies of lorcaserin, a 5-HT2C receptor agonist,\npatients should still be monitored for the development of this condition. For that reason, individuals with a history of\nheart failure should use this agent with caution.\n1424\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1425 ---\n\nB.  Other agents for obesity\nIn addition to lorcaserin, several agents with varying mechanisms of action are available for weight loss and the\nmanagement of obesity.\n1.  Appetite suppressants\nPhentermine [FEN-ter-meen] and diethylpropion [dye-eth-ill-PROE-pee-on] are appetite suppressants. They exert\npharmacologic action by increasing the release of norepinephrine and dopamine from the nerve terminals and by\ninhibiting reuptake of these neurotransmitters, thereby increasing levels of neurotransmitters in the brain. The\nincrease in norepinephrine signals a “fight-or-flight” response by the body, which, in turn, decreases appetite.\nTolerance to the weight loss effect of these agents develops within weeks, and weight loss typically plateaus. An\nincrease in the dosage generally does not result in further weight loss, and discontinuation of the drug is usually\nrecommended once the plateau is reached. The anorexiants are classified as controlled substances due to the\npotential for dependence or abuse. Dry mouth, headache, insomnia, and constipation are common adverse effects.\nHeart rate and blood pressure may be increased with these agents. Therefore, these drugs should be avoided in\npatients with a history of uncontrolled hypertension, cardiovascular disease, arrhythmias, heart failure, or stroke.\nConcomitant use of anorexiants with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or other sympathomimetics should be\navoided.\n2.  Lipase inhibitor\nOrlistat  [OR-lih-stat] is the only agent in a class of antiobesity drugs known as lipase inhibitors. It is indicated for\nweight loss or weight maintenance. Orlistat  is a pentanoic acid ester that inhibits gastric and pancreatic lipases, thus\ndecreasing the breakdown of dietary fat into smaller molecules that can be absorbed. Administration of orlistat\ndecreases fat absorption by about 30%. The loss of calories from decreased absorption of fat is the main cause of\nweight loss. Figure 37.13 shows the effects of orlistat  treatment. The clinical utility of orlistat  is limited by\ngastrointestinal adverse effects, including oily spotting, flatulence with discharge, fecal urgency, and increased\ndefecation. These effects may be minimized through a low-fat diet and the use of concomitant cholestyramine.\nOrlistat  is contraindicated in pregnancy and in patients with chronic malabsorption syndrome or cholestasis. The\ndrug also interferes with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and β-carotene. Patients should be advised to take a\nmultivitamin supplement that contains vitamins A, D, E, and K and β-carotene. Orlistat  can also interfere with the\nabsorption of other medications, such as amiodarone, cyclosporine, and levothyroxine, and clinical response to these\nmedications should be monitored if orlistat  is initiated. The dose of levothyroxine should be separated from orlistat\nby at least 4 hours.\nFigure 37.13 Effect of orlistat treatment on body weight.\n3.  Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist\nLiraglutide is an injectable GLP-1 receptor agonist that is indicated for obesity. See",

Combination therapy\nThe combination of phentermine and topiramate has been approved for long-term use in the treatment of obesity.\nInitial studies of the anticonvulsant topiramate observed weight loss in patients taking the medication. Because of\nthe sedating effects of topiramate, the stimulant phentermine was added to counteract sedation and promote\nadditional weight loss. If a patient does not achieve a 5% weight loss after 12 weeks on the highest dose of this\nmedication, then it should be discontinued.

Which medication is most\nappropriate for management of his allergy symptoms?\nA.  Diphenhydramine\nB.  Doxylamine\nC.  Hydroxyzine\nD.  Fexofenadine\nCorrect answer = D. The use of first-generation H1 antihistamines is contraindicated in the treatment of pilots and\nothers who must remain alert. Because of its lower potential to induce drowsiness, fexofenadine may be\nrecommended for individuals working in jobs in which wakefulness is critical.\nWhich statement concerning H1 antihistamines is correct?\nA.  Second-generation H1 antihistamines are relatively free of adverse effects.\nB.  Because of the established long-term safety of first-generation H1 antihistamines, they are the first choice for\nallergic rhinitis.\nC.  The motor coordination involved in driving an automobile is not affected by the use of first-generation H1\nantihistamines.\nD.  H1 antihistamines can be used in the treatment of acute anaphylaxis.\nCorrect answer = A. Second-generation H1 antihistamines are preferred over first-generation agents because they\nare relatively free of adverse effects. Driving performance is adversely affected by first-generation H1\nantihistamines. Epinephrine, not antihistamine, is an acceptable treatment for acute anaphylaxis. Second-\ngeneration H1 antihistamines penetrate the blood–brain barrier to a lesser degree than do the first-generation\ndrugs.\nWhich histamine receptor antagonist is known to enter the central nervous system readily and cause\nsedation?\nA.  Hydroxyzine\nB.  Cetirizine\nC.  Desloratadine\nD.  Loratadine\nCorrect answer = A. Choices B, C, and D are all second-generation antihistamines that cross the blood–brain\nbarrier to a much lesser extent than does hydroxyzine. Hydroxyzine is the only drug that crosses the blood–brain\nbarrier easily.\nWhich drug is an H1-receptor antagonist that also has serotonin receptor antagonism on the appetite center,\nwith the ability to stimulate appetite?\nA.  Hydroxyzine\nB.  Loratadine\nC.  Diphenhydramine\nD.  Cyproheptadine\nCorrect answer = D. Cyproheptadine has significant serotonin antagonism and is known to increase appetite.\nWhich drug for headache is contraindicated in patients with peripheral vascular disease?\nA.  Ergotamine\nB.  Aspirin\nC.  Acetaminophen\nD.  Naproxen\nCorrect answer = A. Ergotamine is contraindicated in peripheral vascular disease because it is a significant\nvasoconstrictor.\nA 29-year-old woman complains of migraine headaches associated with early onset vomiting. Currently, she\nuses ibuprofen as needed for her migraines, but it is not very effective. Which triptan would be ideal for this\npatient?\nA.  Naratriptan\nB.  Zolmitriptan\nC.  Frovatriptan\nD.  Almotriptan1427\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1428 ---\n\n37.7\n37.8\n37.9\n37.10Correct answer = B. Although all of the triptans listed are available as an oral tablet, this patient suffers from\nvomiting associated with her migraines. Zolmitriptan and sumatriptan are available as an intranasal dosage form,\nwhich would be ideal for this patient.\nA 35-year-old woman is having several severe migraines per month. The migraines are usually relieved with\none or two doses of triptan drugs. Which is most appropriate for prophylaxis to reduce the frequency of her\nmigraines?\nA.  Dihydroergotamine\nB.  Ibuprofen\nC.  Propranolol\nD.  Sumatriptan\nCorrect answer = C. β-Blockers such as propranolol are used for prophylaxis to reduce the frequency of\nmigraines. The other medications are all used to treat an acute migraine headache.\nA 27-year-old married woman is asking about treatment options for obesity. She recently stopped taking her\nbirth control medications, as she felt they were contributing to her weight gain. Which medication should be\navoided in this patient?\nA.  Phentermine/topiramate\nB.  Orlistat\nC.  Diethylpropion\nD.  Lorcaserin\nCorrect answer = A. Although patients should not take any medications to lose weight during pregnancy, the\ntopiramate component of this medication is especially dangerous, since it can be teratogenic. Because this patient\nstopped her birth control medicine, she is at risk of becoming pregnant and developing birth defects while also on\nthis medication.\nA fellow health care provider is concerned about prescribing orlistat to adolescent patients. Many of his\nadolescent patients are stopping the medication during the first month of treatment. Which side effect is the\nmost likely reason the adolescents are stopping orlistat?\nA.  Valvulopathy\nB.  Suicidal ideation\nC.  Drowsiness\nD.  Flatulence\nCorrect answer = D. Flatulence is a very common side effect with orlistat, along with several other GI\ndisturbances. For adolescents, these side effects may be embarrassing and difficult to manage. It is important to\ncounsel patients about these gastrointestinal side effects with orlistat and recommend a low-fat diet as well as\ncholestyramine to counteract the effects should they become bothersome. The other side effects listed have been\nseen with other obesity medications, but not with orlistat.\nA 38-year-old obese man with depression is considering a weight loss medication following several failed\nattempts with diet and exercise. Which medication could be considered in this individual?\nA.  Liraglutide\nB.  Bupropion + naltrexone\nC.  Orlistat\nD.  Lorcaserin\nCorrect answer = C. Only orlistat has not been associated with suicidal ideation. All of the other drugs listed may\ncause suicidal ideation and would not be advisable for an individual with depression. Also, with a history of\ndepression, the patient may be taking a medication that could increase serotonin levels. The addition of lorcaserin,\na serotonin receptor agonist, could lead to serotonin syndrome further excluding it from the list of possible\noptions.1428\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1429 ---\n\n38\nAnti-inflammatory, Antipyretic, and Analgesic Agents\nEricDietrich and AmyTalana\n1429\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1430 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nInflammation is a normal, protective response to tissue injury caused by physical trauma, noxious chemicals, or\nmicrobiologic agents. Inflammation is the body’s effort to inactivate or destroy invading organisms, remove\nirritants, and set the stage for tissue repair. When healing is complete, the inflammatory process usually subsides.\nHowever, inappropriate activation of the immune system can result in inflammation and immune-mediated diseases\nsuch as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Normally, the immune system can differentiate between self and nonself. In RA,\nwhite blood cells (WBCs) view the synovium as nonself and initiate an inflammatory attack. WBC activation leads\nto stimulation of T lymphocytes, which recruit and activate monocytes and macrophages. These cells secrete\nproinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1, into the synovial cavity,\nultimately leading to joint destruction and other systemic abnormalities characteristic of RA. In addition to T\nlymphocyte activation, B lymphocytes are also involved and produce rheumatoid factor and other autoantibodies to\nmaintain inflammation. These defensive reactions cause progressive tissue injury, resulting in joint damage and\nerosions, functional disability, pain, and reduced quality of life. Pharmacotherapy for RA includes anti-inflammatory\nand/or immunosuppressive agents that modulate/reduce the inflammatory process, with the goals of reducing\ninflammation and pain, and halting or slowing disease progression. The agents discussed in this chapter ( Figure\n38.1) include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), celecoxib, acetaminophen, and disease-modifying\nantirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Additionally, agents used for the treatment of gout are reviewed.\n1430\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1431 ---\n\n1431\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1432 ---\n\nFigure 38.1 Summary of anti-inflammatory drugs. NSAIDs = nonsteroidal anti-\ninflammatory drugs.\n1432\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1433 ---\n\nII.  Prostaglandins\nNSAIDs act through inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins. Thus, an understanding of NSAIDs requires\ncomprehension of the actions and biosynthesis of prostaglandins—unsaturated fatty acid derivatives containing 20\ncarbons that include a cyclic ring structure. [Note: These compounds are sometimes referred to as eicosanoids;\n“eicosa” refers to the 20 carbon atoms.]\n1433\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1434 ---\n\nA.  Role of prostaglandins as local mediators\nProstaglandins and related compounds are produced in minute quantities by virtually all tissues. They generally act\nlocally on the tissues in which they are synthesized and are rapidly metabolized to inactive products at their sites of\naction. Therefore, prostaglandins do not circulate in the blood in significant concentrations. Thromboxanes and\nleukotrienes are related compounds that are synthesized from the same precursors as the prostaglandins.\n1434\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1435 ---\n\nB.  Synthesis of prostaglandins\nArachidonic acid is the primary precursor of the prostaglandins and related compounds, and it is present as a\ncomponent of the phospholipids of cell membranes. Free arachidonic acid is released from tissue phospholipids by\nthe action of phospholipase A2 via a process controlled by hormones and other stimuli. There are two major\npathways in the synthesis of eicosanoids from arachidonic acid, the cyclooxygenase and the lipoxygenase pathways.\n1435\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1436 ---\n\nCyclooxygenase pathway\nEicosanoids with ring structures (that is, prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and prostacyclins) are synthesized via the\ncyclooxygenase pathway. Two related isoforms of the cyclooxygenase enzymes exist. Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1)\nis responsible for the physiologic production of prostanoids, whereas cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) causes the\nelevated production of prostanoids that occurs in sites of chronic disease and inflammation. COX-1 is a constitutive\nenzyme that regulates normal cellular processes, such as gastric cytoprotection, vascular homeostasis, platelet\naggregation, and reproductive and kidney functions. COX-2 is constitutively expressed in tissues such as the brain,\nkidney, and bone. Its expression at other sites is increased during states of chronic inflammation. Differences in\nbinding site shape have permitted the development of selective COX-2 inhibitors ( Figure 38.2). Additionally,\nexpression of COX-2 is induced by inflammatory mediators like TNF-α and IL-1 but can also be pharmacologically\ninhibited by glucocorticoids (Figure 38.3), which may contribute to the significant anti-inflammatory effects of these\ndrugs.\nFigure 38.2 Structural differences in active sites of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-\n2.\n1436\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1437 ---\n\n1437\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1438 ---\n\nFigure 38.3 Synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. COX = cyclooxygenase.\n2.  Lipoxygenase pathway\nAlternatively, several lipoxygenases can act on arachidonic acid to form leukotrienes (Figure 38.3). Antileukotriene\ndrugs, such as zileuton, zafirlukast , and montelukast , are treatment options for asthma (see",

Prostaglandins and their metabolites act as local signals that fine-tune the response of a specific cell\ntype. Their functions vary depending on the tissue and the specific enzymes within the pathway that are available at\nthat particular site. For example, the release of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) from platelets during tissue injury triggers\nthe recruitment of new platelets for aggregation and local vasoconstriction. However, prostacyclin (PGI2), produced\nby endothelial cells, has opposite effects, inhibiting platelet aggregation and producing vasodilation. The net effect\non platelets and blood vessels depends on the balance of these two prostanoids.\n1439\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1440 ---\n\nD.  Therapeutic uses of prostaglandins\nProstaglandins have a major role in modulating pain, inflammation, and fever. They control many physiological\nfunctions, such as acid secretion and mucus production in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, uterine contractions, and\nrenal blood flow. Prostaglandins are among the chemical mediators released in allergic and inflammatory processes.\nTherefore, they find use for the disorders discussed below (Figure 38.4).\nFigure 38.4 Summary of prostaglandin and prostacyclin analogs.\n1440\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1441 ---\n\nE.  Alprostadil\nAlprostadil  [al-PROS-ta-dil] is a PGE1 analog that is naturally produced in tissues such as seminal vesicles and\ncavernous tissues, in the placenta, and in the ductus arteriosus of the fetus. PGE1 maintains the patency of the ductus\narteriosus during pregnancy. The ductus closes soon after delivery to allow normal blood circulation between the\nlungs and the heart. In neonates with congenital heart conditions, infusion of alprostadil  keeps the ductus open,\nallowing time until surgical correction is possible. Alprostadil  is also used for erectile dysfunction (see",

It stimulates chloride\nchannels in the luminal cells of the intestinal epithelium, thereby increasing intestinal fluid secretion (see Chapter\n40). Nausea and diarrhea are the most common adverse effects of lubiprostone (Figure 38.5).

Misoprostol\nMisoprostol  [mye-soe-PROST-ole], a PGE1 analog, is used to protect the mucosal lining of the stomach during\nchronic NSAID treatment. Misoprostol  interacts with prostaglandin receptors on parietal cells within the stomach,\nreducing gastric acid secretion. Furthermore, misoprostol  has a GI cytoprotective effect by stimulating mucus and\nbicarbonate production. This combination of effects decreases the incidence of NSAID-induced gastric ulcers.\n[Note: There is a combination product containing the NSAID diclofenac and misoprostol .] Misoprostol  is also used\noff-label in obstetric settings for labor induction, since it increases uterine contractions by interacting with\nprostaglandin receptors in the uterus. Misoprostol  has the potential to induce abortion. Therefore, the drug is\ncontraindicated during pregnancy. Its use is limited by common adverse effects including diarrhea and abdominal\npain.\n1443\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1444 ---\n\nH.

By binding to\nprostaglandin receptors, they increase uveoscleral outflow, reducing intraocular pressure. They are administered as\nophthalmic solutions once a day and are as effective as timolol  or better in reducing intraocular pressure.\nBimatoprost  increases eyelash prominence, length, and darkness and is approved for the treatment of eyelash\nhypotrichosis.

These drugs mimic the effects of\nprostacyclin in endothelial cells, producing a significant reduction in pulmonary arterial resistance with a subsequent\nincrease in cardiac index and oxygen delivery. These agents have short half-lives. Epoprostenol  and treprostinil  are\nadministered as a continuous intravenous infusion, and treprostinil  is administered orally or via inhalation or\nsubcutaneous infusion. Inhaled iloprost  requires frequent dosing due to the short half-life (Figure 38.6). Dizziness,\nheadache, flushing, and fainting are the most common adverse effects (Figure 38.7). Bronchospasm and cough can\nalso occur after inhalation of iloprost .\nFigure 38.6 Administration and fate of iloprost.\n1445\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1446 ---\n\nFigure 38.7 Some adverse reactions to iloprost.\n1446\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1447 ---\n\nIII.  Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs\nNSAIDs are a group of chemically dissimilar agents that differ in their antipyretic, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory\nactivities. The class includes derivatives of salicylic acid (aspirin [AS-pir-in], diflunisal  [dye-FLOO-ni-sal],\nsalsalate [SAL-sa-late]), propionic acid (ibuprofen [eye-bue-PROE-fen], fenoprofen [fen-oh-PROE-fen],\nflurbiprofen [flure-BI-proe-fen], ketoprofen [kee-toe-PROE-fen], naproxen [na-PROX-en], oxaprozin [ox-a-PROE-\nzin]), acetic acid (diclofenac [dye-KLOE-fen-ak], etodolac [ee-toe-DOE-lak], indomethacin [in-doe-METH-a-sin],\nketorolac [kee-toe-ROLE-ak], nabumetone [na-BUE-me-tone], sulindac [sul-IN-dak], tolmetin [TOLE-met-in]),\nenolic acid (meloxicam [mel-OKS-i-kam], piroxicam [peer-OX-i-kam]), fenamates (mefenamic [me-fe-NAM-ik]\nacid, meclofenamate [me-kloe-fen-AM-ate]), and the selective COX-2 inhibitor ( celecoxib [sel-e-KOX-ib]). They\nact primarily by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzymes that catalyze the first step in prostanoid biosynthesis. This\nleads to decreased prostaglandin synthesis with both beneficial and unwanted effects. [Note: Differences in safety\nand efficacy of the NSAIDs may be explained by relative selectivity for the COX-1 or COX-2 enzyme. Inhibition of\nCOX-2 is thought to lead to the anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions of NSAIDs, whereas inhibition of COX-1 is\nresponsible for prevention of cardiovascular events and most adverse events.]\n1447\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1448 ---\n\nA.  Aspirin and other NSAIDs\nAspirin can be thought of as a traditional NSAID, but it exhibits anti-inflammatory activity only at relatively high\ndoses that are rarely used. It is used more frequently at lower doses to prevent cardiovascular events such as stroke\nand myocardial infarction (MI). Aspirin is often differentiated from other NSAIDs since it is an irreversible inhibitor\nof cyclooxygenase activity.\n1448\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1449 ---\n\n1.  Mechanism of action\nAspirin is a weak organic acid that irreversibly acetylates and, thus, inactivates cyclooxygenase (Figure 38.8). The\nother NSAIDs are reversible inhibitors of cyclooxygenase. The NSAIDs, including aspirin, have three major\ntherapeutic actions: they reduce inflammation (anti-inflammatory), pain (analgesic effect), and fever (antipyretic\neffect; Figure 38.9). However, not all NSAIDs are equally effective in each of these actions.\nFigure 38.8 Metabolism of aspirin and acetylation of cyclooxygenase by aspirin.\n1449\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1450 ---\n\nFigure 38.9 Actions of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and\nacetaminophen.\na.  Anti-inflammatory actions\nInhibition of cyclooxygenase diminishes the formation of prostaglandins and, thus, modulates aspects of\ninflammation mediated by prostaglandins. NSAIDs inhibit inflammation in arthritis, but they neither arrest the\nprogression of the disease nor induce remission.\nb.  Analgesic action\nPGE2 is thought to sensitize nerve endings to the action of bradykinin, histamine, and other chemical mediators\nreleased locally by the inflammatory process. Thus, by decreasing PGE2 synthesis, the sensation of pain can be\ndecreased. As COX-2 is expressed during times of inflammation and injury, it is thought that inhibition of this\nenzyme is responsible for the analgesic activity of NSAIDs. No single NSAID has demonstrated superior efficacy\nover another, and they are generally considered to have equivalent analgesic efficacy. The NSAIDs are used mainly\nfor the management of mild to moderate pain arising from musculoskeletal disorders. One exception is ketorolac,\nwhich can be used for more severe pain, but for only a short duration.\nc.  Antipyretic action\nFever occurs when the set-point of the anterior hypothalamic thermoregulatory center is elevated. This can be\ncaused by PGE2 synthesis, which is stimulated when endogenous fever-producing agents (pyrogens), such as\ncytokines, are released from WBCs that are activated by infection, hypersensitivity, malignancy, or inflammation.\nThe NSAIDs lower body temperature in patients with fever by impeding PGE2 synthesis and release, resetting the\n“thermostat” back toward normal. This rapidly lowers the body temperature of febrile patients by increasing heat\ndissipation through peripheral vasodilation and sweating. NSAIDs have no effect on normal body temperature.\n2.  Therapeutic uses1450\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1451 ---\n\na.  Anti-inflammatory and analgesic uses\nNSAIDs are used in the treatment of osteoarthritis, gout, RA, and common conditions requiring analgesia (for\nexample, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, and dysmenorrhea). Combinations of opioids and NSAIDs may be effective\nin treating pain caused by malignancy. Furthermore, the addition of NSAIDs may lead to an opioid-sparing effect,\nallowing for lower doses of opioids to be utilized. The salicylates exhibit analgesic activity at lower doses. Only at\nhigher doses do these drugs show anti-inflammatory activity (Figure 38.10). For example, two 325-mg aspirin\ntablets administered four times daily produce analgesia, whereas 12 to 20 tablets per day produce both analgesic and\nanti-inflammatory activity.\n1451\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1452 ---\n\nFigure 38.10 Dose-dependent effects of salicylate.\nb.  Antipyretic uses\nAspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen may be used to treat fever. [Note: Aspirin should be avoided in patients less than\n19 years old with viral infections, such as varicella (chickenpox) or influenza, to prevent Reye syndrome—a\n1452\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1453 ---\n\nsyndrome that can cause fulminating hepatitis with cerebral edema, often leading to death.]\nc.  Cardiovascular applications\nAspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1–mediated production of TXA2, thereby reducing TXA2-mediated\nvasoconstriction and platelet aggregation and the subsequent risk of cardiovascular events (Figure 38.11). The\nantiplatelet effects persist for the life of the platelet. Low doses of aspirin (75 to 162 mg—commonly 81 mg) are\nused prophylactically to reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events, transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), stroke,\nand death in patients with a history of previous MI, TIA, or stroke. Chronic use of aspirin allows for continued\ninhibition as new platelets are generated. Aspirin is also used acutely to reduce the risk of death in acute MI and in\npatients undergoing certain revascularization procedures.\nFigure 38.11 Aspirin irreversibly inhibits platelet cyclooxygenase-1.\nd.  External applications\nSalicylic acid is used topically to treat acne, corns, calluses, and warts. Methyl salicylate (“oil of wintergreen”) is\nused externally as a cutaneous counterirritant in liniments, such as arthritis creams and sports rubs. Diclofenac is\navailable in topical formulations (gel or solution) for treatment of osteoarthritis in the knees or hands. In addition,\nocular formulations of ketorolac are approved for management of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis and inflammation\nand pain related to ocular surgery.\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\na.  Aspirin\nAfter oral administration, aspirin is rapidly deacetylated by esterases in the body to produce salicylate. Unionized\nsalicylates are passively absorbed mainly from the upper small intestine. Salicylates (except for diflunisal ) cross\nboth the blood–brain barrier and the placenta and are absorbed through intact skin (especially methyl salicylate).\nSalicylate is converted by the liver to water-soluble conjugates that are rapidly cleared by the kidney, resulting in\nfirst-order elimination and a serum half-life of 3.5 hours. At anti-inflammatory dosages of aspirin (more than 4\ng/day), the hepatic metabolic pathway becomes saturated, and zero-order kinetics are observed, leading to a half-life\nof 15 hours or more (Figure 38.12). Salicylate is secreted into the urine and can affect uric acid excretion. Therefore,\naspirin should be avoided in gout, if possible, or in patients taking probenecid.\n1453\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1454 ---\n\nFigure 38.12 Effect of dose on the half-life of aspirin.\nb.  Other NSAIDs\nMost NSAIDs are well absorbed after oral administration and circulate highly bound to plasma proteins. The\nmajority are metabolized by the liver, mostly to inactivate metabolites. Few (for example, nabumetone and sulindac)\nhave active metabolites. Excretion of active drug and metabolites is primarily via the urine.\n4.  Adverse events\nBecause of the adverse event profile, it is preferable to use NSAIDs at the lowest effective dose for the shortest\nduration possible.\na.  Gastrointestinal\nThese are the most common adverse effects of NSAIDs, ranging from dyspepsia to bleeding. Normally, production\nof prostacyclin (PGI2) inhibits gastric acid secretion, and PGE2 and PGF2α stimulate synthesis of protective mucus\nin both the stomach and small intestine. Agents that inhibit COX-1 reduce beneficial levels of these prostaglandins,\nresulting in increased gastric acid secretion, diminished mucus protection, and increased risk for GI bleeding and\nulceration. Agents with a higher relative selectivity for COX-1 may have a higher risk for GI events compared to\nthose with a lower relative selectivity for COX-1 (that is, higher COX-2 selectivity). NSAIDs should be taken with\nfood or fluids to diminish GI upset. If NSAIDs are used in patients at high risk for GI events, proton pump inhibitors\nor misoprostol  should be used concomitantly to prevent NSAID-induced ulcers (see",

        "content": "Chapter 40).\nb.  Increased risk of bleeding (antiplatelet effect)\nAs described above, aspirin inhibits COX-1–mediated formation of TXA2 and reduces platelet aggregation for the\nlifetime of the platelet (3 to 7 days). Platelet aggregation is the first step in thrombus formation, and the antiplatelet\neffect of aspirin results in a prolonged bleeding time. For this reason, aspirin is often withheld for at least 1 week\nprior to surgery. NSAIDs other than aspirin are not utilized for their antiplatelet effect but can still prolong bleeding\ntime, especially when combined with anticoagulants. Concomitant use of NSAIDs and aspirin can prevent aspirin\nfrom binding to cyclooxygenase. Patients who take aspirin for cardioprotection should avoid concomitant NSAID\nuse if possible or take aspirin at least 30 minutes prior to the NSAID.\nc.  Renal effects\nNSAIDs prevent the synthesis of PGE2 and PGI2, prostaglandins that are responsible for maintaining renal blood\nflow (Figure 38.13). Decreased synthesis of prostaglandins can result in retention of sodium and water and may\ncause edema. Patients with a history of heart failure or kidney disease are at particularly high risk. These effects can\nalso mitigate the beneficial effects of antihypertensive medications. In susceptible patients, NSAIDs have led to1454\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1455 ---\n\nacute kidney injury.\nFigure 38.13 Renal effect of NSAID inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. NSAIDs =\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\nd.  Cardiac effects\nAgents such as aspirin, with a very high degree of COX-1 selectivity at low doses, have a cardiovascular protective\neffect thought to be due to a reduction in the production of TXA2. Agents with higher relative COX-2 selectivity\nhave been associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events, possibly by decreasing PGI2 production\nmediated by COX-2. An increased risk for cardiovascular events, including MI and stroke, has been associated with\nall NSAIDs except aspirin. All NSAIDs carry a boxed warning regarding the increased risk for cardiovascular\nevents. Use of NSAIDs, other than aspirin, is discouraged in patients with established cardiovascular disease. For\npatients with cardiovascular disease in whom NSAID treatment cannot be avoided, naproxen may be the least likely\nto be harmful.\nOther adverse effects\nNSAIDs are inhibitors of cyclooxygenases and, therefore, inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins but not of\nleukotrienes. For this reason, NSAIDs should be used with caution in patients with asthma, as inhibition of\nprostaglandin synthesis can cause a shift toward leukotriene production and increase the risk of asthma\nexacerbations. Central nervous system (CNS) adverse events, such as headache, tinnitus, and dizziness, may occur.\nApproximately 15% of patients taking aspirin experience hypersensitivity reactions. Symptoms of true allergy\ninclude urticaria, bronchoconstriction, and angioedema. Patients with severe hypersensitivity to aspirin should avoid\nusing NSAIDs.\nf.  Drug interactions\nSalicylate is roughly 80% to 90% plasma protein bound (albumin) and can be displaced from protein-binding sites,\nresulting in increased concentration of free salicylate. Alternatively, aspirin can displace other highly protein-bound\ndrugs, such as warfarin, phenytoin, or valproic acid, resulting in higher free concentrations of these agents (Figure\n38.14).\n1455\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1456 ---\n\n1456\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1457 ---\n\nFigure 38.14 Drugs interacting with salicylates.\ng.  Toxicity\nMild salicylate toxicity is called salicylism and is characterized by nausea, vomiting, marked hyperventilation,\nheadache, mental confusion, dizziness, and tinnitus (ringing or roaring in the ears). When large doses of salicylate\nare administered, severe salicylate intoxication may result (see Figure 38.10). Restlessness, delirium, hallucinations,\nconvulsions, coma, respiratory and metabolic acidosis, and death from respiratory failure may occur. Children are\nparticularly prone to salicylate intoxication; ingestion of as little as 10 g of aspirin can be fatal.\nh.  Pregnancy\nNSAIDs should be used in pregnancy only if benefits outweigh risks to the developing fetus. [Note: Acetaminophen\nis preferred if analgesic or antipyretic effects are needed during pregnancy.] In the third trimester, NSAIDs should\ngenerally be avoided due to the risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.\n1457\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1458 ---\n\nB.  Celecoxib\nCelecoxib [SEL-e-KOX-ib], a selective COX-2 inhibitor, is significantly more selective for inhibition of COX-2\nthan COX-1 (Figure 38.15). Unlike the inhibition of COX-1 by aspirin (which is irreversible), the inhibition of\nCOX-2 is reversible.\nFigure 38.15 Relative selectivity of some commonly used NSAIDs. Data shown as the\nlogarithm of their ratio of IC80 (drug concentration to achieve 80% inhibition of\ncyclooxygenase). *Aspirin graphed for IC50 value due to it showing significantly more\nCOX-1 selectivity at lower doses and graph using higher concentrations does not\n1458\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1459 ---\n\naccurately reflect the usage or selectivity of aspirin.\n1.  Therapeutic uses\nCelecoxib is approved for the treatment of RA, osteoarthritis, and acute pain. Celecoxib has similar efficacy to\nNSAIDs in the treatment of pain.\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\nCelecoxib is readily absorbed after oral administration. It is extensively metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450\n(CYP2C9), and the metabolites are excreted in feces and urine. The half-life is about 11 hours, and the drug may be\ndosed once or twice daily. The dosage should be reduced in those with moderate hepatic impairment, and celecoxib\nshould be avoided in patients with severe hepatic or renal disease.\n3.  Adverse effects\nHeadache, dyspepsia, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are the most common adverse effects. Celecoxib is associated\nwith less GI bleeding and dyspepsia than other NSAIDs. However, this benefit is lost when aspirin is added to\ncelecoxib therapy. Patients who are at high risk of ulcers and require aspirin for cardiovascular prevention should\navoid the use of celecoxib. Like other NSAIDs, celecoxib has a similar risk for cardiovascular events. Patients who\nhave had anaphylactoid reactions to aspirin or nonselective NSAIDs may be at risk for similar effects with\ncelecoxib. Inhibitors of CYP2C9, such as fluconazole, may increase serum levels of celecoxib.\nFigure 38.16 summarizes some of the therapeutic advantages and disadvantages of members of the NSAID\nfamily.\nFigure 38.16 Summary of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs). *As a\ngroup, with the exception of aspirin, these drugs may have the potential to increase risk\nof myocardial infarction and stroke. GI = gastrointestinal; CNS = central nervous system;\nCOX-2 = cyclooxygenase-2.\n1459\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1460 ---\n\nIV.  Acetaminophen\nAcetaminophen [a-SEET-a-MIN-oh-fen] (N -acetyl-p-aminophenol or APAP) inhibits prostaglandin synthesis in the\nCNS, leading to antipyretic and analgesic effects. Acetaminophen has less effect on cyclooxygenase in peripheral\ntissues (due to peripheral inactivation), which accounts for its weak anti-inflammatory activity. Acetaminophen does\nnot affect platelet function or increase bleeding time. It is not considered an NSAID.\n1460\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1461 ---\n\nA.  Therapeutic uses\nAcetaminophen is used for the treatment of fever and the relief of pain. It is useful in patients with gastric\ncomplaints/risks with NSAIDs and those who do not require the anti-inflammatory action of NSAIDs.\nAcetaminophen is the analgesic/antipyretic of choice for children with viral infections or chickenpox (due to the risk\nof Reye syndrome with aspirin).\n1461\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1462 ---\n\nB.  Pharmacokinetics\nAcetaminophen is rapidly absorbed from the GI tract and undergoes significant first-pass metabolism. It is\nconjugated in the liver to form inactive glucuronidated or sulfated metabolites. A portion of acetaminophen is\nhydroxylated to form N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine, or NAPQI, a highly reactive metabolite that can react with\nsulfhydryl groups and cause liver damage. At normal doses of acetaminophen, NAPQI reacts with the sulfhydryl\ngroup of glutathione produced by the liver, forming a nontoxic substance (Figure 38.17). Acetaminophen and its\nmetabolites are excreted in urine. The drug is also available in intravenous and rectal formulations.\n1462\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1463 ---\n\n1463\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1464 ---\n\nFigure 38.17 Metabolism of acetaminophen.\n1464\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1465 ---\n\nC.  Adverse effects\nAt normal therapeutic doses, acetaminophen has few significant adverse effects. With large doses of acetaminophen,\nthe available glutathione in the liver becomes depleted, and NAPQI reacts with the sulfhydryl groups of hepatic\nproteins (see Figure 38.17). Hepatic necrosis, a serious and potentially life-threatening condition, can result. Patients\nwith hepatic disease, viral hepatitis, or a history of alcoholism are at higher risk of acetaminophen-induced\nhepatotoxicity.

Traditional Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs\nTraditional DMARDs (methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide, or sulfasalazine) are used in the treatment of\nRA and have been shown to slow the course of the disease, induce remission, and prevent further destruction of the\njoints and involved tissues. Following diagnosis of RA, these agents should be started as soon as possible to delay\nprogression of the disease. Monotherapy may be initiated with any of the traditional DMARDs, although\nmethotrexate is generally preferred. For patients with inadequate response to monotherapy, a combination of\ntraditional DMARDs, or use of a TNF inhibitor or non-TNF biologic agent may be needed. NSAIDs or\nglucocorticoids can also be used for their anti-inflammatory actions.\n1466\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1467 ---\n\nA.  Methotrexate\nMethotrexate [meth-oh-TREX-ate] is a folic acid antagonist that inhibits cytokine production and purine nucleotide\nbiosynthesis, leading to immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects. It has become a mainstay of treatment in\npatients with RA. Response to methotrexate usually occurs within 3 to 6 weeks of starting treatment. Other\ntraditional DMARDs, TNF inhibitors, or non-TNF biologic agents can be added to methotrexate if there is\ninadequate response to monotherapy with this agent. Doses of methotrexate required for RA treatment are much\nlower than those needed in cancer chemotherapy and are generally administered once weekly, thereby minimizing\nadverse effects. Common adverse effects of methotrexate when used for RA are mucosal ulceration and nausea.\nCytopenias (particularly leukopenia), cirrhosis of the liver, and an acute pneumonia-like syndrome may occur with\nchronic administration. [Note: Supplementation with folic acid may improve tolerability of methotrexate and reduce\nGI and hepatic adverse effects.] Periodic liver function tests, complete blood counts, and monitoring for signs of\ninfection are recommended. Methotrexate is contraindicated in pregnancy.\n1467\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1468 ---\n\nB.  Hydroxychloroquine\nHydroxychloroquine [hye-drox-ee-KLOR-oh-kwin] is used for early, mild RA, and may be combined with\nmethotrexate. Its mechanism of action in autoimmune disorders is unknown, and onset of effects takes 6 weeks to 6\nmonths. Hydroxychloroquine has less adverse effects on the liver and immune system than other DMARDs.\nHowever, it may cause ocular toxicity, including irreversible retinal damage and corneal deposits, CNS\ndisturbances, GI upset, and skin discoloration and eruptions.\n1468\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1469 ---\n\nC.  Leflunomide\nLeflunomide [le-FLOO-no-mide] is an immunomodulatory agent that preferentially causes cell arrest of the\nautoimmune lymphocytes through its action on dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). After biotransformation,\nleflunomide becomes a reversible inhibitor of DHODH, an enzyme necessary for pyrimidine synthesis (Figure\n38.18). Leflunomide may be used as monotherapy in patients who have intolerance or contraindications to use of\nmethotrexate in RA, or it may be used in combination with methotrexate for patients with suboptimal response to\nmethotrexate alone. Common adverse effects include headache, diarrhea, and nausea. Other effects are weight loss,\nallergic reactions, including a flu-like syndrome, skin rash, alopecia, and hypokalemia. The drug is not\nrecommended in patients with liver disease as it can be hepatotoxic. Leflunomide is contraindicated in pregnancy.\nMonitoring parameters include signs of infection, complete blood count, electrolytes, and liver enzymes.\n1469\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1470 ---\n\nFigure 38.18 Site of action of leflunomide.\n1470\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1471 ---\n\n1471\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1472 ---\n\nD.  Sulfasalazine\nSulfasalazine [sul-fa-SAH-la-zeen] has recommendations for use similar to leflunomide in the treatment of RA. Its\nmechanism of action in treating RA is unclear. The onset of activity is 1 to 3 months, and it is associated with GI\nadverse effects (nausea, vomiting, anorexia) and leukopenia.\n1472\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1473 ---\n\nE.

Glucocorticoids should\nalways be used at the lowest dose and for the shortest duration possible to avoid adverse effects associated with\nlong-term use.\n1473\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1474 ---\n\nVI.  Biologic Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs\nIL-1 and TNF-α are proinflammatory cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of RA. When secreted by synovial\nmacrophages, IL-1 and TNF-α stimulate synovial cells to proliferate and synthesize collagenase, thereby degrading\ncartilage, stimulating bone resorption, and inhibiting proteoglycan synthesis. The TNF-α inhibitors (adalimumab,\ncertolizumab, etanercept , golimumab, and infliximab) are biologic DMARDs which have been shown to decrease\nsigns and symptoms of RA, reduce progression of structural damage, and improve physical function. Clinical\nresponse can be seen within 2 weeks of therapy. TNF-α inhibitors are usually employed in RA after a patient has an\ninadequate response to traditional DMARDs. These agents may be used alone or in combination with traditional\nDMARDs. If a patient has failed monotherapy with one TNF-α inhibitor, a traditional DMARD may be added, or\ntherapy with a non-TNF biologic agent or a different TNF-α inhibitor may be tried. TNF-α inhibitors should be used\ncautiously in those with heart failure, as they can cause and/or worsen preexisting heart failure. An increased risk of\nlymphoma and other cancers has been observed with the use of TNF-α inhibitors.\nBiologic DMARDs include the TNF-α inhibitors, as well as the non-TNF biologic agents (abatacept , rituximab,\ntocilizumab). Like TNF-α inhibitors, non-TNF biologics are generally used in RA after a patient has an inadequate\nresponse to traditional DMARDs, and they may be used alone or in combination with traditional DMARDs. If a\npatient has failed monotherapy with one non-TNF biologic, a trial of another non-TNF biologic with or without\nmethotrexate is warranted. Patients receiving biologic DMARDs are at increased risk for infections, such as\ntuberculosis, fungal opportunistic infections, and sepsis. [Note: TNF-α inhibitors and non-TNF biologic agents\nshould not be used together due to the risk of severe infections.] Reactivation of hepatitis B may occur with the use\nof these agents. Live vaccinations should not be administered to patients taking any of the biologic DMARDs.\nCharacteristics of the TNF-α inhibitors and non-TNF biologic therapies for the treatment of RA are outlined below.\n[Note: TNF-α inhibitors find use in a number of disorders, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease (see Chapter\n40), psoriasis, and ankylosing spondylitis.]\n1474\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1475 ---\n\nA.  Adalimumab\nAdalimumab [AY-da-LIM-ue-mab] is a recombinant monoclonal antibody that binds to TNF-α and interferes with\nits activity by blocking interaction of TNF-α with cell surface receptors. Adalimumab is administered\nsubcutaneously weekly or every other week. It may cause headache, nausea, agranulocytosis, rash, reaction at the\ninjection site, and increased risk of infections.\n1475\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1476 ---\n\nB.  Certolizumab\nCertolizumab [ser-toe-LIZ-oo-mab] is a humanized antibody that neutralizes biological actions of TNF-α. It is\ncombined with polyethylene glycol (pegylated) and is administered every 2 weeks via subcutaneous injection.\nAdverse effects are similar to other TNF-α inhibitors.\n1476\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1477 ---\n\nC.  Etanercept\nEtanercept  [ee-TAN-er-cept] is a genetically engineered fusion protein that binds to TNF-α, thereby blocking its\ninteraction with cell surface TNF-α receptors. The combination of etanercept  and methotrexate is more effective\nthan methotrexate or etanercept  alone in hindering the RA disease process, improving function, and achieving\nremission (Figure 38.19). Etanercept  is given subcutaneously once weekly and is generally well tolerated.\nFigure 38.19 Incidence of remission from the symptoms of RA after 1 year of therapy.\n1477\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1478 ---\n\nD.  Golimumab\nGolimumab [goe-LIM-ue-mab] neutralizes the biological activity of TNF-α by binding to it and blocking its\ninteraction with cell surface receptors. It is administered subcutaneously once a month in combination with\nmethotrexate. Golimumab may increase hepatic enzymes.\n1478\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1479 ---\n\nE.  Infliximab\nInfliximab [in-FLIX-i-mab] is a chimeric monoclonal antibody composed of human and murine regions. The\nantibody binds specifically to human TNF-α and inhibits binding with its receptors. This agent is not indicated for\nmonotherapy, as this leads to the development of anti-infliximab antibodies and reduced efficacy. Infliximab should\nbe administered with methotrexate. Infliximab is administered as an IV infusion every 8 weeks. Infusion-related\nreactions, such as fever, chills, pruritus, and urticaria, may occur.\n1479\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1480 ---\n\nF.  Abatacept\nT lymphocytes need two interactions to become activated: 1) the antigen-presenting cell (macrophages or B cells)\nmust interact with the receptor on the T cell and 2) the CD80/CD86 protein on the antigen-presenting cell must\ninteract with the CD28 protein on the T cell. Abatacept  [a-BAT-ah-cept] is a recombinant fusion protein and\ncostimulation modulator that competes with CD28 for binding on CD80/CD86 protein, thereby preventing full T-\ncell activation and reducing the inflammatory response. Abatacept  is administered as an IV infusion every 4 weeks.\nCommon adverse effects include infusion-related reactions, headache, upper respiratory infections, and nausea.\n1480\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1481 ---\n\nG.  Rituximab\nIn RA, B lymphocytes can perpetuate the inflammatory process in the synovium by 1) activating T lymphocytes, 2)\nproducing autoantibodies and rheumatoid factor, and 3) producing proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and\nIL-1. Rituximab [ri-TUK-si-mab] is a chimeric murine/human monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20\nantigen found on the surface of normal and malignant B lymphocytes. Administration of rituximab results in B-cell\ndepletion. Rituximab is administered as an intravenous infusion every 16 to 24 weeks. To reduce infusion reactions,\nmethylprednisolone, acetaminophen, and an antihistamine are administered prior to each infusion. Infusion reactions\n(urticaria, hypotension, and angioedema) are the most common complaints and typically occur during the first\ninfusion.\n1481\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1482 ---\n\nH.  Tocilizumab and sarilumab\nTocilizumab [toe-si-LIZ-ue-mab] and sarilumab [sar-IL-ue-mab] are recombinant monoclonal antibodies that bind\nto IL-6 receptors and inhibit activity of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6. Both tocilizumab and sarilumab are\nadministered as a subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks. Tocilizumab may also be administered as an intravenous\ninfusion every 4 weeks. Adverse reactions to tocilizumab include elevated liver function tests, hyperlipidemia,\nneutropenia, hypertension, and infusion-related and injection site reactions. Adverse reactions for sarilumab are\nsimilar.\n1482\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1483 ---\n\nVII.  Other Drugs for Rheumatoid Arthritis\nJanus kinases are intracellular enzymes that modulate immune cell activity in response to the binding of\ninflammatory mediators to the cellular membrane. Tofacitinib [toe-fa-SYE-ti-nib] is a synthetic small molecule that\nis an oral inhibitor of Janus kinases. It is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe established RA in patients\nwho have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate. Metabolism of tofacitinib is mediated\nprimarily by CYP3A4, and dosage adjustments may be required if the drug is taken with potent inhibitors or\ninducers of this isoenzyme. Hemoglobin concentrations must be greater than 9 g/dL to start tofacitinib and must be\nmonitored during therapy due to the risk for anemia. Likewise, lymphocyte and neutrophil counts should be checked\nprior to initiation of therapy and monitored during treatment. Tofacitinib treatment may also increase the risk for\nnew primary malignancy and opportunistic infections. Due to long-term safety concerns, tofacitinib is usually\nreserved for patients who have inadequate response or intolerance to other agents. [Note: Anakinra, azathioprine,\ncyclosporine, gold, and minocycline are other agents used infrequently in the treatment of RA due to their adverse\neffect profile or the availability of other agents with more proven efficacy.]\n1483\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1484 ---\n\nVIII.  Drugs Used for the Treatment of Gout\nGout is a metabolic disorder characterized by high levels of uric acid in the blood (hyperuricemia). Hyperuricemia\ncan lead to deposition of sodium urate crystals in tissues, especially the joints and kidney. The deposition of urate\ncrystals initiates an inflammatory process involving the infiltration of granulocytes that phagocytize the urate\ncrystals (Figure 38.20). Acute flares of gout usually present as pain, swelling, tenderness, and redness in the affected\njoints (for example, big toe, knees, ankles, wrists, or elbows). The cause of hyperuricemia in gout is an imbalance\nbetween overproduction of uric acid and/or the inability to excrete uric acid renally. Most therapeutic strategies for\ngout involve lowering the uric acid level below the saturation point (6 mg/dL), thus preventing the deposition of\nurate crystals. This can be accomplished by interfering with uric acid synthesis or increasing uric acid excretion.\n1484\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1485 ---\n\n1485\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1486 ---\n\nFigure 38.20 Role of uric acid in the inflammation of gout.\n1486\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1487 ---\n\nA.  Treatment of acute gout\nAcute gout attacks can result from a number of conditions, including excessive alcohol consumption, a diet rich in\npurines, and kidney disease. NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and colchicine are effective agents for the management of\nacute gouty arthritis. Indomethacin is considered the classic NSAID of choice, although all NSAIDs are likely to be\neffective in decreasing pain and inflammation. Intra-articular administration of corticosteroids (when only one or\ntwo joints are affected) is also appropriate in the acute setting, or systemic corticosteroids for more widespread joint\ninvolvement. Patients are candidates for prophylactic urate-lowering therapy if they have more than two attacks per\nyear or they have chronic kidney disease, kidney stones, or tophi (deposit of urate crystals in the joints, bones,\ncartilage, or other body structures).\n1487\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1488 ---\n\nB.  Treatment of chronic gout\nUrate-lowering therapy for chronic gout aims to reduce the frequency of attacks and complications of gout.\nTreatment strategies include the use of xanthine oxidase inhibitors to reduce the synthesis of uric acid or use of\nuricosuric drugs to increase its excretion. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (allopurinol , febuxostat ) are first-line urate-\nlowering agents. Uricosuric agents (probenecid) may be used in patients who are intolerant to xanthine oxidase\ninhibitors or fail to achieve adequate response with those agents. [Note: Initiation of urate-lowering therapy can\nprecipitate an acute gout attack due to rapid changes in serum urate concentrations. Medications for the prevention\nof an acute gout attack (low-dose colchicine, NSAIDs, or corticosteroids) should be initiated with urate-lowering\ntherapy and continued for at least 6 months.]\n1488\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1489 ---\n\nC.  Colchicine\nColchicine [KOL-chi-seen], a plant alkaloid, is used for the treatment of acute gouty attacks. It is neither a uricosuric\nnor an analgesic agent, although it relieves pain in acute attacks of gout.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nColchicine binds to tubulin, a microtubular protein, causing its depolymerization. This disrupts cellular functions,\nsuch as the mobility of neutrophils, thus decreasing their migration into the inflamed joint. Furthermore, colchicine\nblocks cell division by binding to mitotic spindles.\n2.  Therapeutic uses\nThe anti-inflammatory activity of colchicine is specific for gout, usually alleviating the pain of acute gout within 12\nhours. [Note: Colchicine must be administered within 36 hours of onset of attack to be effective.] NSAIDs have\nlargely replaced colchicine in the treatment of acute gouty attacks for safety reasons. Colchicine is also used as a\nprophylactic agent to prevent acute attacks of gout in patients initiating urate-lowering therapy.\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\nColchicine is administered orally and is rapidly absorbed from the GI tract. Colchicine is metabolized by hepatic\nCYP450 3A4 and other tissues. It undergoes enterohepatic recirculation and exhibits high interpatient variability in\nthe elimination half-life. A portion of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine.\n4.  Adverse effects\nColchicine may cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea ( Figure 38.21). Chronic administration may\nlead to myopathy, neutropenia, aplastic anemia, and alopecia. The drug should not be used in pregnancy and should\nbe used with caution in patients with hepatic, renal, or cardiovascular disease. Dosage adjustments are required in\npatients taking CYP3A4 inhibitors (for example, clarithromycin and itraconazole) or P-gp inhibitors (for example,\namiodarone and verapamil ) and those with severe renal impairment.\n1489\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1490 ---\n\nFigure 38.21 Some adverse effects of colchicine. GI = gastrointestinal.\n1490\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1491 ---\n\n1491\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1492 ---\n\nD.  Allopurinol\nAllopurinol  [al-oh-PURE-i-nole], a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is a purine analog. It reduces the production of uric\nacid by competitively inhibiting the last two steps in uric acid biosynthesis that are catalyzed by xanthine oxidase\n(see Figure 38.20).\n1.  Therapeutic uses\nAllopurinol  is an effective urate-lowering therapy in the treatment of gout and hyperuricemia secondary to other\nconditions, such as that associated with certain malignancies (those in which large amounts of purines are produced,\nparticularly after chemotherapy) or in renal disease.\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\nAllopurinol  is completely absorbed after oral administration. The primary metabolite alloxanthine (oxypurinol) is\nalso a xanthine oxidase inhibitor with a half-life of 15 to 18 hours. Thus, effective inhibition of xanthine oxidase can\nbe maintained with once-daily dosing. The drug and its active metabolite are excreted in the urine. Dose adjustment\nis needed if estimated glomerular filtration rate is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2.\n3.  Adverse effects\nAllopurinol  is well tolerated by most patients. Hypersensitivity reactions, especially skin rashes, are the most\ncommon adverse reactions. The risk is increased in those with reduced renal function. Because acute attacks of gout\nmay occur more frequently during the first several months of therapy, colchicine, NSAIDs, or corticosteroids can be\nadministered concurrently.\n1492\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1493 ---\n\nE.  Febuxostat\nFebuxostat  [feb-UX-oh-stat] is an oral xanthine oxidase inhibitor structurally unrelated to allopurinol . Its adverse\neffect profile is similar to that of allopurinol , although the risk for rash and hypersensitivity reactions may be\nreduced. Febuxostat  does not have the same degree of renal elimination as allopurinol  and thus requires less\nadjustment in those with reduced renal function. Febuxostat  should be used with caution in patients with a history of\nheart disease or stroke, as this agent may be associated with a greater risk of these events as compared to\nallopurinol .\n1493\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1494 ---\n\nF.  Probenecid\nProbenecid [proe-BEN-a-sid] is an oral uricosuric drug. It is a weak organic acid that promotes renal clearance of\nuric acid by inhibiting the urate-anion exchanger in the proximal tubule. At therapeutic doses, it blocks proximal\ntubular reabsorption of uric acid. Probenecid should be avoided if the creatinine clearance is less than 50 mL/min.\nAdverse effects include nausea, vomiting, and dermatologic reactions, and, rarely, anemia or anaphylactic reactions.\n1494\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1495 ---\n\nG.  Pegloticase\nPegloticase [peg-LOE-ti-kase] is a recombinant form of the enzyme urate oxidase or uricase. It acts by converting\nuric acid to allantoin, a water-soluble nontoxic metabolite that is excreted primarily by the kidneys. Pegloticase is\nindicated for patients with gout who fail treatment with standard therapies such as xanthine oxidase inhibitors. It is\nadministered as an IV infusion every 2 weeks. Infusion-related reactions and anaphylaxis may occur with\npegloticase, and patients should be premedicated with antihistamines and corticosteroids.\n1495\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1496 ---\n\n38.1\n38.2\n38.3\n38.4\n38.5Study Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nA 64-year-old man presents with mild to moderate musculoskeletal back pain. He states that he has tried\nacetaminophen without relief. His medical history includes diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gastric\nulcer (resolved), and coronary artery disease. Which is the most appropriate NSAID regimen to treat this\npatient’s pain?\nA.  Celecoxib\nB.  Indomethacin and omeprazole\nC.  Naproxen and omeprazole\nD.  Naproxen\nCorrect answer = C. This patient is at high risk of future ulcers, due to the history of gastric ulcer. Therefore,\nusing a regimen that includes an agent that is more COX-2 selective or a proton pump inhibitor is warranted.\nTherefore, D is incorrect. Choices A and B are incorrect because this patient has significant cardiovascular risk\nand a history of coronary artery disease. Naproxen is thought of as the safest NSAID regarding cardiovascular\ndisease, though it still can present risks. Therefore, C is correct as it uses the first-choice NSAID with the GI\nprotection of a proton pump inhibitor.\nWhich statement is correct regarding the difference between acetaminophen and naproxen?\nA.  Acetaminophen has more anti-inflammatory effects compared with naproxen.\nB.  Acetaminophen has more GI side effects but less effects on bleeding compared with naproxen.\nC.  Acetaminophen has less risk for CV events compared with naproxen.\nD.  Acetaminophen has fewer antipyretic effects than naproxen.\nCorrect answer = C. While acetaminophen inhibits prostaglandin synthesis via COX inhibition, it is inactivated\nperipherally so it is devoid of systemic GI, CV, and bleeding adverse effects which are hallmarks of NSAIDs like\nnaproxen. However, as acetaminophen is active centrally, it is still able to maintain antipyretic effects similar to\nother NSAIDs.\nWhich statement correctly describes the proposed mechanism of cardioprotection from low-dose aspirin?\nA.  Aspirin preferentially inhibits COX-2 to lead to a relative reduction in thromboxane A2 levels.\nB.  Aspirin preferentially inhibits COX-1 to lead to a relative reduction in thromboxane A2 levels.\nC.  Aspirin preferentially inhibits COX-2 to lead to a relative reduction in prostacyclin levels.\nD.  Aspirin preferentially inhibits COX-1 to lead a relative reduction in prostacyclin levels.\nCorrect answer = B. At low doses aspirin selectively inhibits COX-1, which reduces the production of\nthromboxane A2, a substance that promotes vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation. COX-2 activity is thought\nto lead to relatively higher levels of prostacyclin which causes vasodilation and inhibits platelet aggregation.\nSelective COX-2 inhibitors, as well as all NSAIDs, may increase the risk for CV events by inhibiting the\nbeneficial production of prostacyclin by COX-2, thereby leading to a relative imbalance of thromboxane A2, and\npromoting platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction.\nWhich statement correctly describes the pathophysiologic actions of prostaglandins at a target tissue?\nA.  Promote vasoconstriction in the kidneys.\nB.  Promote sodium and water retention in the kidneys.\nC.  Decrease secretion of mucus at the lining of the stomach.\nD.  Decrease secretion of gastric acid in the stomach.\nCorrect answer = D. Prostaglandins, specifically PGE2 and PGI2, cause vasodilation in the renal arteries; a\ndecrease in prostaglandins from NSAIDs can lead to vasoconstriction of renal arteries as well as sodium and\nwater retention. In the stomach, PGI2 inhibits gastric acid secretion, while PGE2 and PGF2α promote secretion of\nprotective mucus at the stomach lining.\nWhich prostaglandin agent can be used to maintain the patency of the ductus arteriosus in neonates with\ncongenital heart problems while awaiting surgery?\nA.  Misoprostol\nB.  Epoprostenol\nC.  Bimatoprost\nD.  Alprostadil\nCorrect answer = D. Misoprostol, a PGE1 analog, is used for GI protection or labor induction. Epoprostenol, a\nPGI2 analog, is used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Bimatoprost, a PGF2α analog, is used\ntopically in the eye for the treatment of open angle glaucoma or on the lashes for hypotrichosis. Alprostadil, a\nPGE1 analog, is used to maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus in neonates with congenital heart problems. The\ndrug can also be used for erectile dysfunction.1496\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1497 ---\n\n38.6\n38.7\n38.8\n38.9\n38.10A 34-year-old woman with RA is planning for pregnancy. Which RA agents are absolutely contraindicated\nin pregnancy?\nA.  Abatacept and rituximab\nB.  Adalimumab and certolizumab\nC.  Infliximab and etanercept\nD.  Methotrexate and leflunomide\nCorrect answer = D. Both methotrexate and leflunomide are contraindicated in pregnancy. Data are limited in\nother RA agents to confirm or rule out teratogenicity in pregnancy. The risk of RA treatment on the developing\nfetus should be weighed against the benefits of improved RA symptoms with these therapies. Any adverse\noutcomes should be reported to the pregnancy registry.\nWhich agent for RA competes with CD28 to prevent full T-cell activation?\nA.  Sarilumab\nB.  Abatacept\nC.  Golimumab\nD.  Adalimumab\nCorrect answer = B. Abatacept is a costimulation modulator that competes with CD28 to prevent its binding on\nCD80/CD86 protein, resulting in reduced T-cell activation. Golimumab and adalimumab are both TNF-α\ninhibitors, and sarilumab is an IL-6 inhibitor.\nWhich statement correctly represents the mechanism of action of tofacitinib in the treatment of RA?\nA.  TNF-α inhibitor\nB.  Janus kinase inhibitor\nC.  IL-6 receptor blocker\nD.  Dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor\nCorrect answer = B. Tofacitinib is an inhibitor of Janus kinases 1, 3, and, to a lesser extent, 2. Methotrexate\ninhibits dihydrofolate reductase. Etanercept is an example of TNF-α inhibitor, and tocilizumab is an example of\nan IL-6 inhibitor.\nA 54-year-old man with gout is found to have an issue with renal excretion of uric acid. Which drug is an\noral agent that would target the cause of his acute gout attacks?\nA.  Allopurinol\nB.  Febuxostat\nC.  Probenecid\nD.  Pegloticase\nCorrect answer = C. Probenecid is a uricosuric agent that increases renal excretion by inhibiting the urate–anion\nexchanger in the proximal tubule, thereby blocking reabsorption of uric acid and facilitating its excretion.\nAllopurinol and febuxostat are xanthine oxidase inhibitors, which primarily act by decreasing uric acid\nproduction. Pegloticase works by increasing renal excretion of uric acid; however, it is an IV infusion.\nA 64-year-old man presents with signs and symptoms of an acute gouty flare. Which strategy is the least\nlikely to acutely improve his gout symptoms and pain?\nA.  Naproxen\nB.  Colchicine\nC.  Probenecid\nD.  Prednisone\nCorrect answer = C. Probenecid is a uricosuric agent indicated to lower serum urate levels to prevent gout attacks.\nIt is not indicated during acute gout flares and should not be started until after the resolution of an acute attack.\nNaproxen, colchicine, and prednisone all represent viable treatment options that acutely reduce pain and\ninflammation associated with acute gout attacks.1497\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1498 ---\n\n39\nDrugs for Disorders of the Respiratory System\nKyle Melin\n1498\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1499 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nAsthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and allergic rhinitis are commonly encountered respiratory\ndisorders. Each of these conditions may be associated with a troublesome cough, which may be the only presenting\ncomplaint. Asthma is a chronic disease characterized by hyperresponsive airways that affects over 235 million\npatients worldwide. This disorder is underdiagnosed and undertreated, creating a substantial burden to individuals\nand families, and resulting in millions of emergency room visits. COPD is currently the fourth leading cause of\ndeath in the world, and is predicted to become the third leading cause of death by 2030. Allergic rhinitis is a\ncommon chronic disease and is characterized by itchy, watery eyes, runny nose, and a nonproductive cough that can\nsignificantly decrease quality of life. Each of these respiratory conditions may be managed with a combination of\nlifestyle changes and medications. Drugs used to treat respiratory conditions can be delivered topically to the nasal\nmucosa, inhaled into the lungs, or given orally or parenterally for systemic absorption. Local delivery methods, such\nas nasal sprays or inhalers, are preferred to target affected tissues while minimizing systemic adverse effects.\nMedications used to treat common respiratory disorders are summarized in Figure 39.1.\nFigure 39.1 Summary of drugs affecting the respiratory system. *Indicates intranasal\nformulation. SABA = short-acting β2 agonist; LABA = long-acting β2 agonist; LAMA =\nlong-acting muscarinic antagonist.\n1499\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1500 ---\n\n1500\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1501 ---\n\nII.  Preferred Drugs Used to Treat Asthma\nAsthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by episodes of acute bronchoconstriction that\ncause shortness of breath, cough, chest tightness, wheezing, and rapid respiration.\n1501\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1502 ---\n\nA.  Pathophysiology of asthma\nAirflow obstruction in asthma is due to bronchoconstriction that results from contraction of bronchial smooth\nmuscle, inflammation of the bronchial wall, and increased secretion of mucus ( Figure 39.2). The underlying\ninflammation of the airways contributes to airway hyperresponsiveness, airflow limitation, respiratory symptoms,\nand disease chronicity. Asthma attacks may be triggered by exposure to allergens, exercise, stress, and respiratory\ninfections. Unlike COPD, cystic fibrosis, and bronchiectasis, asthma is usually not a progressive disease.

The goals of\nasthma therapy are to decrease the intensity and frequency of asthma symptoms, prevent future exacerbations, and\nminimize limitations in activity related to asthma symptoms. First-line drug therapy based on classification of\nasthma is presented in Figure 39.3.\nFigure 39.3 Guidelines for the treatment of asthma. In all asthmatic patients, quick relief\nis provided by a SABA as needed for symptoms. *Eighty percent or more of predicted\nfunction. ICS = inhaled corticosteroid; LABA = long-acting b2 agonist.\n1505\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1506 ---\n\nC.  β 2-Adrenergic agonists\nInhaled β2-adrenergic agonists directly relax airway smooth muscle. They are used for the quick relief of asthma\nsymptoms, as well as adjunctive therapy for long-term control of the disease.\n1.  Quick relief\nShort-acting β2 agonists (SABAs) have a rapid onset of action (5 to 30 minutes) and provide relief for 4 to 6 hours.\nThey are used for symptomatic treatment of bronchospasm, providing quick relief of acute bronchoconstriction. All\npatients with asthma should receive a SABA inhaler for use as needed. β2 agonists have no anti-inflammatory\neffects, and they should not be used as monotherapy for patients with persistent asthma. However, monotherapy\nwith SABAs may be appropriate for patients with mild, intermittent asthma or exercise-induced bronchospasm.\nDirect-acting β2-selective agonists include albuterol  [al-BYOO-ter-all] and levalbuterol  [leh-val-BYOO-ter-all].\nThese agents provide significant bronchodilation with little of the undesired effect of α or β1 stimulation (see",

Actions on lung\nICS therapy directly targets underlying airway inflammation by decreasing the inflammatory cascade (eosinophils,\nmacrophages, and T lymphocytes), reversing mucosal edema, decreasing the permeability of capillaries, and\ninhibiting the release of leukotrienes. After several months of regular use, ICS reduce the hyperresponsiveness of the\nairway smooth muscle to a variety of bronchoconstrictor stimuli, such as allergens, irritants, cold air, and exercise.\n2.

However, as with all inhaled medications, appropriate inhalation technique is critical to the\nsuccess of therapy (see section on Inhaler Technique).\nb.  Oral/systemic\nPatients with a severe exacerbation of asthma (status asthmaticus) may require intravenous methylprednisolone or\noral prednisone to reduce airway inflammation. In most cases, suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal\ncortex axis does not occur during the oral prednisone “burst” (short course) typically prescribed for an asthma\nexacerbation.

Alternative Drugs Used to Treat Asthma\nThese drugs are useful for treatment of asthma in patients who are poorly controlled by conventional therapy or\nexperience adverse effects secondary to corticosteroid treatment. These drugs should be used in conjunction with\nICS therapy for most patients.\n1510\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1511 ---\n\nA.  Leukotriene modifiers\nLeukotrienes (LT) B4 and the cysteinyl leukotrienes, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, are products of the 5-lipoxygenase\npathway of arachidonic acid metabolism and part of the inflammatory cascade. 5-Lipoxygenase is found in cells of\nmyeloid origin, such as mast cells, basophils, eosinophils, and neutrophils. LTB4 is a potent chemoattractant for\nneutrophils and eosinophils, whereas the cysteinyl leukotrienes constrict bronchiolar smooth muscle, increase\nendothelial permeability, and promote mucus secretion. Zileuton [zye-LOO-ton] is a selective and specific inhibitor\nof 5-lipoxygenase, preventing the formation of both LTB4 and the cysteinyl leukotrienes. Zafirlukast  [za-FIR-loo-\nkast] and montelukast  [mon-te-LOO-kast] are selective antagonists of the cysteinyl leukotriene-1 receptor, and they\nblock the effects of cysteinyl leukotrienes ( Figure 39.4). These agents are approved for the prevention of asthma\nsymptoms. They should not be used in situations where immediate bronchodilation is required. Leukotriene receptor\nantagonists have also shown efficacy for the prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm.\n1.  Pharmacokinetics\nThese agents are orally active and highly protein bound. Food impairs the absorption of zafirlukast . The drugs\nundergo extensive hepatic metabolism. Zileuton and its metabolites are excreted in urine, whereas zafirlukast ,\nmontelukast , and their metabolites undergo biliary excretion.\n2.  Adverse effects\nElevations in serum hepatic enzymes may occur with these drugs, requiring periodic monitoring and discontinuation\nwhen enzymes exceed three to five times the upper limit of normal. Other effects include headache and dyspepsia.\nZafirlukast  is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes 2C8, 2C9, and 3A4, and zileuton inhibits\nCYP1A2. Coadministration with drugs that are substrates of these isoenzymes may result in increased effects and/or\ntoxicity.\n1511\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1512 ---\n\nB.  Cromolyn\nCromolyn [KRO-moe-lin] is a prophylactic anti-inflammatory agent that inhibits mast cell degranulation and release\nof histamine. It is an alternative therapy for mild persistent asthma and is available as a nebulized solution. Because\ncromolyn is not a bronchodilator, it is not useful in managing an acute asthma attack. Due to its short duration of\naction, this agent requires dosing three or four times daily, which affects adherence and limits its use. Adverse\neffects are minor and include cough, irritation, and unpleasant taste.\n1512\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1513 ---\n\nC.

        "content": "Chapter 5). Inhaled ipratropium [IP-ra-TROE-pee-um], a short-acting quaternary derivative of atropine, is not\nrecommended for the routine treatment of acute bronchospasm in asthma, as its onset is much slower than that of\ninhaled SABAs. However, it may be useful in patients who are unable to tolerate a SABA or patients with asthma–\nCOPD overlap syndrome. Ipratropium also offers additional benefit when used with a SABA for the treatment of\nacute asthma exacerbations in the emergency department. Tiotropium [tye-oh-TROE-pee-um], a long-acting\nanticholinergic agent, can be used as an add-on treatment in adult patients with severe asthma and a history of\nexacerbations. Adverse effects such as xerostomia and bitter taste are related to local anticholinergic effects.\n1513\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1514 ---\n\nD.  Theophylline\nTheophylline [thee-OFF-i-lin] is a bronchodilator that relieves airflow obstruction in chronic asthma and decreases\nasthma symptoms. It may also possess anti-inflammatory activity, although the mechanism of action is unclear.\nPreviously, the mainstay of asthma therapy, theophylline has been largely replaced with β2 agonists and\ncorticosteroids due to its narrow therapeutic window, adverse effect profile, and potential for drug interactions.\nOverdose may cause seizures or potentially fatal arrhythmias. Theophylline is metabolized in the liver and is a\nCYP1A2 and 3A4 substrate. It is subject to numerous drug interactions. Serum concentration monitoring should be\nperformed when theophylline is used chronically.\n1514\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1515 ---\n\nE.  Monoclonal antibodies\nOmalizumab [OH-ma-LIZ-oo-mab] is a monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to human immunoglobulin E\n(IgE). This leads to decreased binding of IgE to its receptor on the surface of mast cells and basophils. Reduction in\nsurface-bound IgE limits the release of mediators of the allergic response. The monoclonal antibodies mepolizumab\n[MEP-oh-LIZ-ue-mab], benralizumab [ben-ra-LIZ-ue-mab], and reslizumab [res-LIZ-ue-mab] are interleukin-5 (IL-\n5) antagonists. IL-5 is the major cytokine involved in recruitment, activation, and survival of eosinophils in\neosinophilic asthma. These agents are indicated for the treatment of severe persistent asthma in patients who are\npoorly controlled with conventional therapy. Their use is limited by the high cost, route of administration (IV for\nreslizumab and subcutaneous for others), and adverse effect profile. Adverse effects include serious anaphylactic\nreactions (rare), arthralgias, fever, rash, and increased risk of infections. New malignancies have been reported.\n1515\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1516 ---\n\nIV.  Drugs Used to Treat Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease\nCOPD is a chronic, irreversible obstruction of airflow that is usually progressive and characterized by persistent\nsymptoms. These may include cough, excess mucus production, chest tightness, breathlessness, difficulty sleeping,\nand fatigue. Although symptoms are similar to asthma, the characteristic irreversible airflow obstruction of COPD is\none of the most significant differences between the diseases. Smoking is the greatest risk factor for COPD and is\ndirectly linked to the progressive decline of lung function, as demonstrated by forced expiratory volume in one\nsecond (FEV1). Smoking cessation should be recommended regardless of stage and severity of COPD, or the age of\npatient. Drug therapy for COPD is aimed at relief of symptoms and prevention of disease progression.\nUnfortunately, with currently available care, many patients still experience a decline in lung function over time.\n1516\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1517 ---\n\nA.  Bronchodilators\nInhaled bronchodilators, including the β2-adrenergic agonists and anticholinergic agents (muscarinic antagonists),\nare the foundation of therapy for COPD ( Figure 39.5). These drugs increase airflow, alleviate symptoms, and\ndecrease exacerbations. The long-acting bronchodilators, LABAs and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs),\nare preferred as first-line treatment of COPD for all patients except those who are at low risk with less symptoms.\nLABAs include once-daily indacaterol  [in-da-KA-ter-ol], olodaterol  [OH-loe-DAT-er-ol], and vilanterol  [vye-\nLAN-ter-ol], as well as the twice-daily inhaled formulations of arformoterol , formoterol , and salmeterol . Aclidinium\n[A-kli-DIN-ee-um], tiotropium, glycopyrrolate [GLYE-koe-PIR-oh-late], and umeclidinium [ue-ME-kli-DIN-ee-\num]) are LAMAs. The combination of an anticholinergic and a β2 agonist may be helpful in patients who have\ninadequate response to a single inhaled bronchodilator and are at risk of exacerbations.\nFigure 39.5 Guidelines for the pharmacologic therapy of stable chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease. FEV1 = forced expiratory volume in 1 second; ICS = inhaled\ncorticosteroid; LABA = long-acting β2 agonist; LAMA = long-acting muscarinic\nantagonist; SABA = short-acting β2 agonist.\n1517\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1518 ---\n\nB.  Corticosteroids\nThe addition of an ICS to a long-acting bronchodilator may improve symptoms, lung function, and quality of life in\nCOPD patients with FEV1 of less than 60% predicted or patients with symptoms of both asthma and COPD.\nHowever, ICS treatment in COPD should be restricted to these patients, since use is associated with an increased\nrisk of pneumonia. Although often used for acute exacerbations, oral corticosteroids are not recommended for long-\nterm treatment of COPD.\n1518\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1519 ---\n\nC.  Other agents\nRoflumilast  [roe-FLUE-mi-last] is an oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor used to reduce exacerbations in patients\nwith severe chronic bronchitis. Although its activity is not well defined in COPD, it is theorized to reduce\ninflammation by increasing levels of intracellular cAMP in lung cells. Roflumilast  is not a bronchodilator and is not\nindicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm. Its use is limited by common adverse effects including weight loss,\nnausea, diarrhea, and headache. In COPD, the use of theophylline has largely been replaced by the more effective\nand tolerable long-acting bronchodilators.\n1519\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1520 ---\n\nV.  Inhaler Technique\nAppropriate inhaler technique differs between metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) and dry powder inhalers (DPIs). Proper\ntechnique is critical to the success of therapy, and inhaler technique should be assessed regularly.\n1520\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1521 ---\n\nA.  Metered-dose inhalers and dry powder inhalers\nMDIs have propellants that eject the active medication from the canister. Patients should be instructed to exhale\nbefore they actuate the inhaler, and then begin to inhale slowly as they press the canister and continue inhaling\nslowly and deeply throughout actuation. This technique avoids impaction of the medication onto the laryngeal\nmucosa and facilitates the drug reaching the site of action in the bronchial smooth muscle. A large fraction (typically\n80% to 90%) of inhaled medication (for example, corticosteroids) is either deposited in the mouth and pharynx or\nswallowed (Figure 39.6). The remaining 10% to 20% of a dose of inhaled glucocorticoids that is not swallowed\nreaches the site of action in the airway. Use of appropriate technique with ICS reduces the risk of systemic\nabsorption and adverse effects. DPIs require a different inhaler technique. Patients should be instructed to inhale\nquickly and deeply to optimize drug delivery to the lungs. Patients using any type of inhaled corticosteroid device\nshould be instructed to rinse the mouth after use to prevent the development of oral candidiasis.\n1521\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1522 ---\n\nFigure 39.6 Pharmacokinetics of inhaled glucocorticoids. GI = gastrointestinal.\n1522\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1523 ---\n\n1523\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1524 ---\n\nB.  Spacers\nA spacer is a large-volume chamber attached to an MDI. The chamber reduces the velocity of the aerosol before\nentering the mouth, allowing large drug particles to be deposited in the device. The smaller, higher-velocity drug\nparticles are less likely to be deposited in the mouth and more likely to reach the target airway tissue (Figure 39.7).\nPatients should be advised to wash and/or rinse spacers to reduce the risk of bacterial or fungal growth that may\ninduce an asthma attack.\nFigure 39.7 Effect of a spacer on the delivery of an inhaled aerosol.\n1524\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1525 ---\n\nVI.  Drugs Used to Treat Allergic Rhinitis\nRhinitis is an inflammation of the mucous membranes of the nose and is characterized by sneezing, itchy nose/eyes,\nwatery rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and sometimes a nonproductive cough. An attack may be precipitated by\ninhalation of an allergen (such as dust, pollen, or animal dander). The foreign material interacts with mast cells\ncoated with IgE generated in response to a previous allergen exposure. The mast cells release mediators, such as\nhistamine, leukotrienes, and chemotactic factors that promote bronchiolar spasm and mucosal thickening from\nedema and cellular infiltration. Antihistamines and/or intranasal corticosteroids are preferred therapies for allergic\nrhinitis.\n1525\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1526 ---\n\nA.

Ophthalmic and nasal antihistamine delivery devices are\navailable for targeted, topical tissue delivery. Examples of topical intranasal antihistamines include olopatadine\n[OH-loe-PA-ta-deen] and azelastine [a-ZEL-uh-steen]. Intranasal antihistamines provide increased delivery of the\ndrug with fewer adverse effects. Combinations of antihistamines with decongestants (see below) are effective when\ncongestion is a feature of rhinitis, or when patients have no response or incomplete control of symptoms with\nintranasal corticosteroids.\n1526\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1527 ---\n\nB.  Corticosteroids\nIntranasal corticosteroids, such as beclomethasone, budesonide, fluticasone, ciclesonide, mometasone, and\ntriamcinolone, are the most effective medications for treatment of allergic rhinitis. With an onset of action that\nranges from 3 to 36 hours after first dose, intranasal corticosteroids improve sneezing, itching, rhinorrhea, and nasal\ncongestion. Systemic absorption is minimal, and adverse effects of treatment are localized. These include nasal\nirritation, nosebleed, sore throat, and, rarely, candidiasis. To minimize systemic absorption, patients should be\ninstructed to avoid deep inhalation during administration into the nose, because the target tissue is the nose, not the\nlungs or the throat. For patients with chronic rhinitis, improvement may not be seen until 1 to 2 weeks after starting\ntherapy.\n1527\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1528 ---\n\nC.  α-Adrenergic agonists\nShort-acting α-adrenergic agonists (“nasal decongestants”), such as phenylephrine, constrict dilated arterioles in the\nnasal mucosa and reduce airway resistance.

However,\nintranasal formulations of α-adrenergic agonists should be used for no longer than 3 days due to the risk of rebound\nnasal congestion (rhinitis medicamentosa). For this reason, the α-adrenergic agents are not used in the long-term\ntreatment of allergic rhinitis. Administration of oral α-adrenergic agonists results in a longer duration of action but\nalso increased systemic effects, such as increased blood pressure and heart rate (see",

Drugs Used to Treat Cough\nCoughing is an important defense mechanism of the respiratory system in response to irritants and is a common\nreason for patients to seek medical care. A troublesome cough may represent several etiologies, such as the common\ncold, sinusitis, or an underlying chronic respiratory disease. In some cases, cough may be an effective defense reflex\nagainst an underlying bacterial infection and should not be suppressed. Before treating cough, identification of its\ncause is important to ensure that antitussive treatment is appropriate. The priority should always be to treat the\nunderlying cause of cough when possible.\n1530\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1531 ---\n\nA.  Opioids\nCodeine [KOE-deen], an opioid, decreases the sensitivity of cough centers in the central nervous system to\nperipheral stimuli and decreases mucosal secretion. These therapeutic effects occur at doses lower than those\nrequired for analgesia. However, common adverse effects, such as constipation, dysphoria, and fatigue, still occur.\nIn addition, codeine has addictive potential, which limits its use, given increasing concerns with opioid addiction in\nthe United States (see",

These localized effects may be particularly problematic if the\ncapsules are broken or chewed and the drug comes in direct contact with the oral mucosa.\n1532\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1533 ---\n\n39.1\n39.2\n39.3\n39.4\n39.5Study Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nA 12-year-old girl with asthma presents to the emergency room with complaints of cough, dyspnea, and\nwheezing after visiting a riding stable. Which is the most appropriate drug to rapidly reverse her\nbronchoconstriction?\nA.  Inhaled fluticasone\nB.  Inhaled beclomethasone\nC.  Inhaled albuterol\nD.  Intravenous propranolol\nCorrect answer = C. Inhalation of a rapid-acting β2 agonist, such as albuterol, usually provides immediate\nbronchodilation. An acute asthmatic crisis often requires intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone.\nInhaled corticosteroids such as beclomethasone and fluticasone treat chronic airway inflammation but do not\nprovide any immediate effect. Propranolol is a nonselective β-blocker and would aggravate the\nbronchoconstriction.\nA 9-year-old girl has severe asthma that required three hospitalizations in the past year. She is now receiving\ntherapy that has greatly reduced the frequency of severe attacks. Which drug is most likely responsible for\nthis benefit?\nA.  Inhaled albuterol\nB.  Inhaled ipratropium\nC.  Inhaled fluticasone\nD.  Oral zafirlukast\nCorrect answer = C. Administration of an inhaled corticosteroid such as fluticasone significantly reduces the\nfrequency of severe asthma attacks. This benefit is accomplished with minimal risk of the severe systemic\nadverse effects of oral corticosteroid therapy. The β2 agonist albuterol is used to treat acute asthma symptoms.\nIpratropium has more common use in COPD and sometimes in the acute management of acute asthma\nexacerbations. Zafirlukast may reduce the severity of attacks, but not to the same degree or consistency as\nfluticasone (or other corticosteroids).\nA 68-year-old man has COPD with moderate airway obstruction. Despite using salmeterol twice daily, he\nreports continued symptoms of shortness of breath with mild exertion. Which agent is an appropriate\naddition to his current therapy?\nA.  Systemic corticosteroids\nB.  Albuterol\nC.  Tiotropium\nD.  Roflumilast\nCorrect answer = C. The addition of an anticholinergic bronchodilator to the LABA salmeterol would be\nappropriate and provide additional therapeutic benefit. Systemic corticosteroids are used to treat exacerbations in\npatients with COPD, but not recommended for chronic use. The addition of a SABA (albuterol) is less likely to\nprovide additional benefit since the patient is already using medication with the same mechanism of action.\nRoflumilast is not indicated, since the patient only has moderate airway obstruction.\nA 58-year-old woman with COPD has been hospitalized three times in the past year for COPD\nexacerbations. She reports only mild symptoms between exacerbations. Her regimen for the past year has\nincluded inhaled salmeterol twice daily and inhaled tiotropium once daily. Her current FEV1 is below 60%.\nWhich is an appropriate change in her drug therapy?\nA.  Discontinue the tiotropium.\nB.  Discontinue the salmeterol.\nC.  Change the salmeterol to a combination product that includes both a LABA and an inhaled corticosteroid (for\nexample, salmeterol/fluticasone DPI).\nD.  Add theophylline.\nCorrect answer = C. The addition of an inhaled corticosteroid may provide additional benefit since the patient has\nsignificant airway obstruction and frequent exacerbations requiring hospitalization. It is not routinely\nrecommended to discontinue a long-acting bronchodilator unless the patient experiences an adverse effect or\nexperiences no therapeutic benefit. In this case, the patient reports mild symptoms in between exacerbations,\nsuggesting she may benefit from both bronchodilators. Theophylline is an oral bronchodilator that is beneficial to\nsome patients with stable COPD. However, because of its toxic potential, its use is not routinely recommended.\nA 32-year-old man with a history of opioid addiction presents with cough due to a viral upper respiratory\nsystem infection. Which is appropriate symptomatic treatment for cough in this patient?\nA.  Guaifenesin/dextromethorphan\nB.  Guaifenesin/codeine1533\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1534 ---\n\n39.6\n39.7\n39.8\n39.9\n39.10C.  Benzonatate\nD.  Montelukast\nCorrect answer = C. Benzonatate suppresses the cough reflex through peripheral action and has no abuse\npotential. Dextromethorphan, an opioid derivative, and codeine, an opioid, both have abuse potential.\nMontelukast is not indicated for cough suppression.\nBecause of its anti-inflammatory mechanism of action, which drug requires regular administration for the\ntreatment of asthma?\nA.  Tiotropium\nB.  Salmeterol\nC.  Mometasone\nD.  Albuterol\nCorrect answer = C. Inhaled corticosteroids have direct anti-inflammatory properties on the airways and require\nregular dosing to be effective. Tiotropium is used more frequently for the treatment of COPD. It does not have\nanti-inflammatory effects like the corticosteroids. Salmeterol and albuterol are both bronchodilators, but do not\nhave anti-inflammatory properties.\nWhich agent is a preferred antihistamine for the management of allergic rhinitis?\nA.  Chlorpheniramine\nB.  Diphenhydramine\nC.  Phenylephrine\nD.  Cetirizine\nCorrect answer = D. Chlorpheniramine and diphenhydramine are first-generation antihistamines and are usually\nnot a preferred treatment due to their increased risk of adverse effects, such as sedation, performance impairment,\nand other anticholinergic effects. Phenylephrine is short-acting α-adrenergic agonist (“nasal decongestant”).\nCetirizine is a second-generation antihistamine and is generally better tolerated, making it a preferred agent for\nallergic rhinitis.\nWhich medication inhibits the action of 5-lipoxygenase and consequently the action of leukotriene B4 and\nthe cysteinyl leukotrienes?\nA.  Cromolyn\nB.  Zafirlukast\nC.  Zileuton\nD.  Montelukast\nCorrect answer = C. Zileuton is the only 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor available. While zafirlukast and montelukast\nboth inhibit the effects of leukotrienes, they do so by blocking the receptor. Cromolyn inhibits mast cell\ndegranulation and the release of histamine.\nWhich statement describes appropriate inhaler technique for a dry powder inhaler?\nA.  Inhale slowly and deeply just before and throughout actuation of the inhaler.\nB.  Use a large-volume chamber (spacer) to decrease deposition of drug in the mouth caused by improper inhaler\ntechnique.\nC.  Inhale quickly and deeply to optimize drug delivery to the lungs.\nD.  Rinse mouth in a “swish-and-spit” method with water prior to inhaler use to decrease the chance of adverse\nevents.\nCorrect answer = C. “Quick and deep” inhalation is required for effective use of a DPI. Inhaling “slowly and\ndeeply” and the use of a spacer describe techniques associated with an MDI, not DPI. Rinsing the mouth may be\nappropriate for either type of inhaler if the medication being administered is an inhaled corticosteroid; however,\nthis should always be done following inhaler use, not prior to use.\nWhich category of allergic rhinitis medications is most likely to be associated with rhinitis medicamentosa\n(rebound nasal congestion) with prolonged use?\nA.  Intranasal corticosteroid\nB.  Intranasal decongestant\nC.  Leukotriene antagonist\nD.  Oral antihistamine\nCorrect answer = B. Intranasal decongestants should be used no longer than 3 days due to the risk of rebound\nnasal congestion (rhinitis medicamentosa). For this reason, the α-adrenergic agents should not be used in the\nlong-term treatment of allergic rhinitis. The other agents may be used as chronic therapies.1534\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1535 ---\n\n1535\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1536 ---\n\n40\nGastrointestinal and Antiemetic Drugs\nCarol Motycka and Adonice Khoury\n1536\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1537 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nThis chapter describes drugs used to treat six common medical conditions involving the gastrointestinal (GI) tract:\n1) peptic ulcers and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), 2) chemotherapy-induced emesis, 3) diarrhea, 4)\nconstipation, 5) irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and 6) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Many drugs\ndescribed in other chapters also find application in the treatment of GI disorders. For example, the meperidine\nderivative diphenoxylate, which decreases peristaltic activity of the gut, is useful in the treatment of severe diarrhea.\nOther drugs are used almost exclusively to treat GI tract disorders. For example, H2 receptor antagonists and proton\npump inhibitors (PPIs) are used to heal peptic ulcers.\n1537\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1538 ---\n\nII.  Drugs Used to Treat Peptic Ulcer Disease and\nGastroesophageal Reflux Disease\nThe two main causes of peptic ulcer disease are infection with gram-negative Helicobacter pylori  and the use of\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Increased hydrochloric acid (HCl) secretion and inadequate\nmucosal defense against gastric acid also play a role. Treatment approaches include 1) eradicating the H. pylori\ninfection, 2) reducing secretion of gastric acid with the use of PPIs or H2 receptor antagonists, and/or 3) providing\nagents that protect the gastric mucosa from damage, such as misoprostol  and sucralfate. Figure 40.1 summarizes\nagents that are effective in treating peptic ulcer disease.\n1538\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1539 ---\n\n1539\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1540 ---\n\nFigure 40.1 Summary of drugs used to treat peptic ulcer disease.\n1540\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1541 ---\n\nA.  Antimicrobial agents\nPatients with peptic ulcer disease (duodenal or gastric ulcers) who are infected with H. pylori  require antimicrobial\ntreatment. Infection with H. pylori  is diagnosed via endoscopic biopsy of the gastric mucosa or various noninvasive\nmethods, including serology, fecal antigen tests, and urea breath tests (Figure 40.2). Figure 40.3 shows a biopsy\nsample in which H. pylori  is discovered on the gastric mucosa. Eradication of H. pylori  with various combinations\nof antimicrobial drugs results in rapid healing of active ulcers and low recurrence rates (less than 15%, compared\nwith 60% to 100% per year for ulcers healed with acid-reducing therapy alone). Currently, quadruple therapy of\nbismuth subsalicylate, metronidazole, and tetracycline plus a PPI is a recommended first-line option. This usually\nresults in a 90% or greater eradication rate. Triple therapy consisting of a PPI combined with amoxicillin\n(metronidazole may be used in penicillin-allergic patients) plus clarithromycin is a preferred treatment when rates of\nclarithromycin resistance are low and the patient has no prior exposure to macrolide antibiotics.\n1541\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1542 ---\n\n1542\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1543 ---\n\nFigure 40.2 Urea breath test, one of several noninvasive methods for detecting presence\nof Helicobacter pylori .\nFigure 40.3 Helicobacter pylori  in association with gastric mucosa.\n1543\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1544 ---\n\nB.  H 2 receptor antagonists\nGastric acid secretion is stimulated by acetylcholine, histamine, and gastrin (Figure 40.4). The receptor-mediated\nbinding of acetylcholine, histamine, or gastrin results in the activation of protein kinases, which in turn stimulates\nthe H+/K+-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) proton pump to secrete hydrogen ions in exchange for K+ into the\nlumen of the stomach. By competitively blocking the binding of histamine to H2 receptors, these agents reduce the\nsecretion of gastric acid. The four drugs used in the United States—cimetidine [si-MET-ih-deen], famotidine [fa-\nMOE-ti-deen], nizatidine [nye-ZA-ti-deen], and ranitidine [ra-NI-ti-deen]—inhibit basal, food-stimulated, and\nnocturnal secretion of gastric acid, reducing acid secretion by approximately 70%. Cimetidine was the first H2\nreceptor antagonist. However, its utility is limited by its adverse effect profile and drug–drug interactions.\nFigure 40.4 Effects of acetylcholine, histamine, prostaglandin E2, and gastrin on gastric\nacid secretion by the parietal cells of stomach. Gs and Gi are membrane proteins that\nmediate the stimulatory or inhibitory effect of receptor coupling to adenylyl cyclase.\n1.  Actions\nThe histamine H2 receptor antagonists act selectively on H2 receptors in the stomach, without effects on H1\nreceptors. They are competitive antagonists of histamine and are fully reversible.\n2.  Therapeutic uses\nThe use of these agents has decreased with the advent of PPIs.\na.  Peptic ulcers\nAll four agents are equally effective in promoting the healing of duodenal and gastric ulcers. However, recurrence is\ncommon if H. pylori  is present and the patient is treated with these agents alone. Patients with NSAID-induced\nulcers should be treated with PPIs, because these agents heal and prevent future ulcers more effectively than do H2\nreceptor antagonists.\nb.  Acute stress ulcers\nThese drugs are given as an intravenous infusion to prevent and manage acute stress ulcers associated with high-risk\npatients in the intensive care setting. However, because tolerance may occur with these agents, PPIs are also used for\nthis indication.\nc.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease\nH2 receptor antagonists are effective for the treatment of heartburn or GERD. H2 receptor antagonists act by\ndecreasing acid secretion; therefore, they may not relieve symptoms of heartburn for up to 45 minutes. Antacids\nmore quickly and efficiently neutralize stomach acid, but their action is short lived. For these reasons, PPIs are now\nused preferentially in the treatment of GERD, especially for patients with severe and frequent heartburn.\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\nAfter oral administration, the H2 receptor antagonists distribute widely throughout the body (including into breast\nmilk and across the placenta) and are excreted mainly in the urine. Cimetidine, ranitidine, and famotidine are also1544\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1545 ---\n\navailable in intravenous formulations. The half-life of these agents may be increased in patients with renal\ndysfunction, and dosage adjustments are needed.\n4.  Adverse effects\nIn general, the H2 receptor antagonists are well tolerated. However, cimetidine can have endocrine effects, such as\ngynecomastia and galactorrhea (continuous release/discharge of milk), because it acts as a nonsteroidal\nantiandrogen. Other central nervous system effects such as confusion and altered mentation occur primarily in\nelderly patients and after intravenous administration. H2 receptor antagonists may reduce the efficacy of drugs that\nrequire an acidic environment for absorption, such as ketoconazole. Cimetidine inhibits several cytochrome P450\nisoenzymes and can interfere with the metabolism of many drugs, such as warfarin, phenytoin, and clopidogrel\n(Figure 40.5).\nFigure 40.5 Drug interactions with cimetidine .\n1545\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1546 ---\n\nC.  Inhibitors of the H+/K+-ATPase proton pump\nThe PPIs bind to the H+/K+-ATPase enzyme system (proton pump) and suppress the secretion of hydrogen ions into\nthe gastric lumen. The membrane-bound proton pump is the final step in the secretion of gastric acid ( Figure 40.4).\nThe available PPIs include dexlansoprazole [DEX-lan-SO-pra-zole], esomeprazole [es-oh-MEH-pra-zole],\nlansoprazole [lan-SO-pra-zole], omeprazole [oh-MEH-pra-zole], pantoprazole [pan-TOE-pra-zole], and\nrabeprazole [rah-BEH-pra-zole].\n1.  Actions\nThese agents are prodrugs with an acid-resistant enteric coating to protect them from premature degradation by\ngastric acid. The coating is removed in the alkaline duodenum, and the prodrug, a weak base, is absorbed and\ntransported to the parietal cell. There, it is converted to the active drug and forms a stable covalent bond with the\nH+/K+-ATPase enzyme. It takes about 18 hours for the enzyme to be resynthesized, and acid secretion is inhibited\nduring this time. At standard doses, PPIs inhibit both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion by more than 90%.\nAn oral product containing omeprazole combined with sodium bicarbonate for faster absorption is also available.\n2.  Therapeutic uses\nThe PPIs are superior to the H2 antagonists in suppressing acid production and healing ulcers. Thus, they are the\npreferred drugs for the treatment of GERD, erosive esophagitis, active duodenal ulcer, and pathologic\nhypersecretory conditions such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. PPIs reduce the risk of bleeding from ulcers caused\nby aspirin and other NSAIDs and may be used for prevention or treatment of NSAID-induced ulcers. PPIs are also\nused for stress ulcer prophylaxis and management. Finally, PPIs are combined with antimicrobial regimens used to\neradicate H. pylori.\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\nThese agents are effective orally. For maximum effect, PPIs should be taken 30 to 60 minutes before breakfast or the\nlargest meal of the day. [Note: Dexlansoprazole has a dual delayed-release formulation and can be taken without\nregard to food.] Esomeprazole, lansoprazole, and pantoprazole are available in intravenous formulations. Although\nthe plasma half-life of these agents is only a few hours, they have a long duration of action due to covalent bonding\nwith the H+/K+-ATPase enzyme. Metabolites of these agents are excreted in urine and feces.\n4.  Adverse effects\nThe PPIs are generally well tolerated. Omeprazole and esomeprazole may decrease the effectiveness of clopidogrel\nbecause they inhibit CYP2C19 and prevent the conversion of clopidogrel  to its active metabolite. Concomitant use\nof these PPIs with clopidogrel  is not recommended. PPIs may increase the risk of fractures, particularly if the\nduration of use is 1 year or greater (Figure 40.6). Prolonged acid suppression with PPIs (and H2 receptor\nantagonists) may result in low vitamin B12 because acid is required for its absorption in a complex with intrinsic\nfactor. Elevated gastric pH may also impair the absorption of calcium carbonate. Calcium citrate is an effective\noption for calcium supplementation in patients on acid suppressive therapy, since absorption of the citrate salt is not\naffected by gastric pH. Diarrhea and Clostridium difficile  colitis may occur in patients receiving PPIs. Patients must\nbe counseled to discontinue PPI therapy and contact their physician if they have diarrhea for several days.\nAdditional adverse effects may include hypomagnesemia and an increased incidence of pneumonia.\n1546\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1547 ---\n\nFigure 40.6 Some adverse effects of proton pump therapy.\nGI = gastrointestinal.\n1547\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1548 ---\n\n1548\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1549 ---\n\nD.  Prostaglandins\nProstaglandin E, produced by the gastric mucosa, inhibits secretion of acid and stimulates secretion of mucus and\nbicarbonate (cytoprotective effect). A deficiency of prostaglandins is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of\npeptic ulcers. Misoprostol  [mye-soe-PROST-ole], an analog of prostaglandin E1, is approved for the prevention of\nNSAID-induced gastric ulcers ( Figure 40.7). Prophylactic use of misoprostol  should be considered in patients who\ntake NSAIDs and are at moderate to high risk of NSAID-induced ulcers, such as elderly patients and those with\nprevious ulcers. Misoprostol  is contraindicated in pregnancy, since it can stimulate uterine contractions and cause\nmiscarriage. Dose-related diarrhea is the most common adverse effect and limits the use of this agent. Thus, PPIs are\npreferred agents for the prevention of NSAID-induced ulcers.\nFigure 40.7 Misoprostol reduces serious gastrointestinal (GI) complications in patients\nwith rheumatoid arthritis receiving NSAIDs.\n1549\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1550 ---\n\nE.  Antacids\nAntacids are weak bases that react with gastric acid to form water and a salt to diminish gastric acidity. Because\npepsin (a proteolytic enzyme) is inactive at a pH greater than 4, antacids also reduce pepsin activity.\n1.  Chemistry\nAntacid products vary widely in their chemical composition, acid-neutralizing capacity, sodium content, and\npalatability. The efficacy of an antacid depends on its capacity to neutralize gastric HCl and on whether the stomach\nis full or empty. Food delays stomach emptying, allowing more time for the antacid to react and prolonging the\nduration of action. Commonly used antacids are combinations of salts of aluminum and magnesium, such as\naluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide [Mg(OH)2]. Calcium carbonate [CaCO3] reacts with HCl to form\nCO2 and CaCl2 and is also a commonly used preparation. Systemic absorption of sodium bicarbonate [NaHCO3]\ncan produce transient metabolic alkalosis and produce a significant sodium load. Therefore, this antacid is not\nrecommended.\n2.  Therapeutic uses\nAntacids are used for symptomatic relief of peptic ulcer disease, heartburn, and GERD. They should be administered\nafter meals for maximum effectiveness. [Note: Calcium carbonate preparations are also used as calcium\nsupplements for the prevention of osteoporosis.]\n3.  Adverse effects\nAluminum hydroxide tends to cause constipation, whereas magnesium hydroxide tends to produce diarrhea.\nPreparations that combine these agents aid in normalizing bowel function. Absorption of the cations from antacids\n(Mg2+, Al3+, Ca2+) is usually not a problem in patients with normal renal function; however, accumulation and\nadverse effects may occur in patients with renal impairment.\n1550\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1551 ---\n\nF.  Mucosal protective agents\nAlso known as cytoprotective compounds, these agents have several actions that enhance mucosal protection\nmechanisms, thereby preventing mucosal injury, reducing inflammation, and healing existing ulcers.\n1.  Sucralfate\nThis complex of aluminum hydroxide and sulfated sucrose binds to positively charged groups in proteins of both\nnormal and necrotic mucosa. By forming complex gels with epithelial cells, sucralfate [soo-KRAL-fate] creates a\nphysical barrier that protects the ulcer from pepsin and acid, allowing the ulcer to heal. Although sucralfate is\neffective for the treatment of duodenal ulcers and prevention of stress ulcers, its use is limited due to the need for\nmultiple daily dosing, drug–drug interactions, and availability of more effective agents. Because it requires an acidic\npH for activation, sucralfate should not be administered with PPIs, H2 antagonists, or antacids. Sucralfate is well\ntolerated, but it can bind to other drugs and interfere with their absorption.\n2.  Bismuth subsalicylate\nThis agent is used as a component of quadruple therapy to heal H. pylori-related peptic ulcers. In addition to its\nantimicrobial actions, it inhibits the activity of pepsin, increases secretion of mucus, and interacts with glycoproteins\nin necrotic mucosal tissue to coat and protect the ulcer.\n1551\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1552 ---\n\nIII.  Drugs Used to Control Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and\nVomiting\nAlthough nausea and vomiting occur in a variety of conditions (for example, motion sickness, pregnancy, and GI\nillnesses) and are always unpleasant for the patient, the nausea and vomiting produced by chemotherapeutic agents\ndemands especially effective management. Nearly 70% to 80% of patients who undergo chemotherapy experience\nnausea and/or vomiting. Several factors influence the incidence and severity of chemotherapy-induced nausea and\nvomiting (CINV), including the specific chemotherapeutic drug (Figure 40.8); the dose, route, and schedule of\nadministration; and patient variables. For example, young patients and women are more susceptible than older\npatients and men, and 10% to 40% of patients experience nausea and/or vomiting in anticipation of chemotherapy\n(anticipatory vomiting). CINV not only affects quality of life but can also lead to rejection of potentially curative\nchemotherapy. In addition, uncontrolled vomiting can produce dehydration, profound metabolic imbalances, and\nnutrient depletion.\n1552\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1553 ---\n\nFigure 40.8 Comparison of emetic potential of anticancer drugs.\n1553\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1554 ---\n\nA.  Mechanisms that trigger vomiting\nTwo brainstem sites have key roles in the vomiting reflex pathway. The chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) is located\nin the area postrema (a circumventricular structure at the caudal end of the fourth ventricle). It is outside the blood–\nbrain barrier. Thus, it can respond directly to chemical stimuli in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid. The second\nimportant site, the vomiting center, which is located in the lateral reticular formation of the medulla, coordinates the\nmotor mechanisms of vomiting. The vomiting center also responds to afferent input from the vestibular system, the\nperiphery (pharynx and GI tract), and higher brainstem and cortical structures. The vestibular system functions\nmainly in motion sickness.\n1554\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1555 ---\n\nB.  Emetic actions of chemotherapeutic agents\nChemotherapeutic agents can directly activate the medullary CTZ or vomiting center. Several neuroreceptors,\nincluding dopamine receptor type 2 and serotonin type 3 (5-HT3), play critical roles. Often, the color or smell of\nchemotherapeutic drugs (and even stimuli associated with chemotherapy) can activate higher brain centers and\ntrigger emesis. Chemotherapeutic drugs can also act peripherally by causing cell damage in the GI tract and by\nreleasing serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine. Serotonin activates 5-HT3 receptors on\nvagal and splanchnic afferent fibers, which then carry sensory signals to the medulla, leading to the emetic response.\n1555\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1556 ---\n\nC.  Antiemetic drugs\nConsidering the complexity of the mechanisms involved in emesis, it is not surprising that antiemetics represent a\nvariety of classes (Figure 40.9) and offer a range of efficacies (Figure 40.10). Anticholinergic drugs, especially the\nmuscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine and H1-receptor antagonists, such as dimenhydrinate, meclizine, and\ncyclizine, are very useful in motion sickness but are ineffective against substances that act directly on the CTZ. The\nmajor categories of drugs used to control CINV include the following:\nFigure 40.9 Summary of drugs used to treat CINV. *In combination with palonosetron.\n1556\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1557 ---\n\nFigure 40.10 Efficacy of antiemetic drugs.\n1.  Phenothiazines\nPhenothiazines, such as prochlorperazine [proe-klor-PER-ah-zeen], act by blocking dopamine receptors in the CTZ.\nProchlorperazine is effective against low or moderately emetogenic chemotherapeutic agents (for example,\nfluorouracil  and doxorubicin). Although increasing the dose improves antiemetic activity, adverse effects are dose\nlimiting.\n2.  5-HT 3 receptor blockers\nThe 5-HT3 receptor antagonists include dolasetron [dol-A-seh-tron], granisetron [gra-NI-seh-tron], ondansetron\n[on-DAN-seh-tron], and palonosetron [pa-low-NO-seh-tron]. These agents selectively block 5-HT3 receptors in the\nperiphery (visceral vagal afferent fibers) and in the CTZ. This class of agents is important in treating CINV, because\nof their superior efficacy and longer duration of action. These drugs can be administered as a single dose prior to\nchemotherapy (intravenously or orally) and are efficacious against all grades of emetogenic therapy. Ondansetron\nand granisetron prevent emesis in 50% to 60% of cisplatin-treated patients. These agents are also useful in the\nmanagement of postoperative nausea and vomiting. 5-HT3 antagonists are extensively metabolized by the liver;\nhowever, only ondansetron requires dosage adjustments in hepatic insufficiency. Excretion is via the urine. QT\nprolongation can occur with high doses of ondansetron and dolasetron. For this reason, the indication for CINV\nprophylaxis was withdrawn for intravenous dolasetron.\n3.  Substituted benzamides\nOne of several substituted benzamides with antiemetic activity, metoclopramide [met-oh-kloe-PRAH-mide], is\neffective at high doses against the emetogenic cisplatin, preventing emesis in 30% to 40% of patients and reducing\nemesis in the majority of patients. Metoclopramide accomplishes this through inhibition of dopamine in the CTZ.\nAntidopaminergic adverse effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms, limit long-term high-dose use.\nMetoclopramide enhances gastric motility and is useful for patients with gastroparesis.\n4.  Butyrophenones\nDroperidol  [droe-PER-i-doll] and haloperidol  [hal-oh-PER-i-doll] act by blocking dopamine receptors. The\nbutyrophenones are moderately effective antiemetics. Droperidol  had been used most often for sedation in\nendoscopy and surgery, usually in combination with opioids or benzodiazepines. However, it may prolong the QTc\ninterval and should be reserved for patients with inadequate response to other agents.\n1557\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1558 ---\n\n5.  Benzodiazepines\nThe antiemetic potency of lorazepam [lor-A-ze-pam] and alprazolam [al-PRAH-zoe-lam] is low. Their beneficial\neffects may be due to their sedative, anxiolytic, and amnestic properties (see",

Corticosteroids\nDexamethasone [dex-a-MEH-tha-sone] and methylprednisolone [meth-ill-pred-NIH-so-lone], used alone, are\neffective against mildly to moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. Most frequently, they are used in combination\nwith other agents. Their antiemetic mechanism is not known, but it may involve blockade of prostaglandins.\n7.  Substance P/neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists\nAprepitant  [ah-PRE-pih-tant], netupitant  [net-UE-pi-tant], and rolapitant  [roe-LA-pi-tant] target the neurokinin\nreceptor in the vomiting center and block the actions of substance P. [Note: Fosaprepitant  is a prodrug of aprepitant\nthat is administered intravenously.] These oral agents are indicated for highly or moderately emetogenic\nchemotherapy regimens, and they are usually administered with dexamethasone and a 5-HT3 antagonist. Unlike\nmost 5-HT3 antagonists, these agents are effective for the delayed phase of CINV, which occurs 24 hours or more\nafter chemotherapy. Aprepitant  and rolapitant  undergo hepatic metabolism, primarily by CYP3A4.\nCoadministration with strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 (for example, clarithromycin or St. John’s wort ,\nrespectively) should be avoided. Aprepitant  is an inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, and it also exhibits dose-\ndependent inhibition of CYP3A4. Therefore, it may affect the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of these\nisoenzymes and is subject to numerous drug interactions. Rolapitant  is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6. Fatigue,\ndiarrhea, abdominal pain, and hiccups are adverse effects of this class.\n8.  Combination regimens\nAntiemetic drugs are often combined to increase efficacy or decrease toxicity (Figure 40.11). Corticosteroids, most\ncommonly dexamethasone, increase antiemetic activity when given with high-dose metoclopramide, a 5-HT3\nantagonist, phenothiazine, butyrophenone, or a benzodiazepine. Antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine, are often\nadministered in combination with high-dose metoclopramide to reduce extrapyramidal reactions or with\ncorticosteroids to counter metoclopramide-induced diarrhea. Addition of a substance P/neurokinin-1 receptor\nantagonist to a 5-HT3 antagonist and dexamethasone is beneficial in highly emetogenic regimens, especially those\nwith delayed CINV.\n1558\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1559 ---\n\nFigure 40.11 Effectiveness of antiemetic activity of some drug combinations against\nemetic episodes in the first 24 hours after cisplatin chemotherapy.\n1559\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1560 ---\n\nIV.  Antidiarrheals\nIncreased motility of the GI tract and decreased absorption of fluid are major factors in diarrhea. Antidiarrheal drugs\ninclude antimotility agents, adsorbents, and drugs that modify fluid and electrolyte transport (Figure 40.12).\nFigure 40.12 Summary of drugs used to treat diarrhea.\n1560\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1561 ---\n\nA.  Antimotility agents\nTwo drugs that are widely used to control diarrhea are diphenoxylate [dye-fen-OKS-i-late] and loperamide [loe-\nPER-ah-mide]. Both are analogs of meperidine and have opioid-like actions on the gut. They activate presynaptic\nopioid receptors in the enteric nervous system to inhibit acetylcholine release and decrease peristalsis. At the usual\ndoses, they lack analgesic effects. Loperamide is used for the general treatment of acute diarrhea, including\ntraveler’s diarrhea. Because these drugs can contribute to toxic megacolon, they should not be used in young\nchildren or in patients with severe colitis.\n1561\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1562 ---\n\nB.  Adsorbents\nAdsorbent agents, such as aluminum hydroxide and methylcellulose [METH-il-SEL-yoo-los], are used to control\ndiarrhea. Presumably, these agents act by adsorbing intestinal toxins or microorganisms and/or by coating or\nprotecting the intestinal mucosa. They are much less effective than antimotility agents, and they can interfere with\nthe absorption of other drugs.\n1562\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1563 ---\n\nC.  Agents that modify fluid and electrolyte transport\nBismuth subsalicylate, used for prevention and treatment of traveler’s diarrhea, decreases fluid secretion in the\nbowel. Its action may be due to its salicylate component as well as its coating action. Adverse effects may include\nblack tongue and black stools.\n1563\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1564 ---\n\nV.  Laxatives\nLaxatives are commonly used in the treatment of constipation to accelerate the motility of the bowel, soften the\nstool, and increase the frequency of bowel movements. These drugs are classified on the basis of their mechanism of\naction (Figure 40.13). Laxatives increase the potential for loss of pharmacologic effect of poorly absorbed, delayed-\nacting, and extended-release oral preparations by accelerating their transit through the intestines. They may also\ncause electrolyte imbalances when used chronically. Many of these drugs have a risk of dependency for the user.\nFigure 40.13 Summary of drugs used to treat constipation.\n1564\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1565 ---\n\nA.  Irritants and stimulants\n1.  Senna\nThis agent is a widely used stimulant laxative. Its active ingredient is a group of sennosides, a natural complex of\nanthraquinone glycosides. Taken orally, senna causes evacuation of the bowels within 6 to 12 hours. It also causes\nwater and electrolyte secretion into the bowel. In combination products with a docusate-containing stool softener, it\nis useful in treating opioid-induced constipation.\n2.  Bisacodyl\nAvailable as suppositories and enteric-coated tablets, bisacodyl  [bis-ak-oh-dil] is a potent stimulant of the colon. It\nacts directly on nerve fibers in the mucosa of the colon.\n3.  Castor oil\nThis agent is broken down in the small intestine to ricinoleic acid, which is very irritating to the stomach and\npromptly increases peristalsis. Pregnant patients should avoid castor oil  because it may stimulate uterine\ncontractions. Use of castor oil  is generally not recommended due to poor palatability and potential for GI adverse\neffects.\n1565\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1566 ---\n\nB.  Bulk laxatives\nThe bulk laxatives include hydrophilic colloids (from indigestible parts of fruits and vegetables). They form gels in\nthe large intestine, causing water retention and intestinal distension, thereby increasing peristaltic activity. Similar\nactions are produced by methylcellulose, psyllium seeds, and bran. They should be used cautiously in patients who\nare immobile because of their potential for causing intestinal obstruction. Psyllium can reduce the absorption of\nother oral drugs, and administration of other agents should be separated from psyllium by at least two hours.\n1566\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1567 ---\n\nC.  Saline and osmotic laxatives\nSaline cathartics, such as magnesium citrate and magnesium hydroxide, are nonabsorbable salts (anions and cations)\nthat hold water in the intestine by osmosis. This distends the bowel, increasing intestinal activity and producing\ndefecation in a few hours. Electrolyte solutions containing polyethylene glycol  (PEG) are used as colonic lavage\nsolutions to prepare the gut for radiologic or endoscopic procedures. PEG powder for solution without electrolytes is\nalso used as a laxative and has been shown to cause less cramping and gas than other laxatives. Lactulose is a\nsemisynthetic disaccharide sugar that acts as an osmotic laxative. It cannot be hydrolyzed by GI enzymes. Oral\ndoses reach the colon and are degraded by colonic bacteria into lactic, formic, and acetic acids. This increases\nosmotic pressure, causing fluid accumulation, colon distension, soft stools, and defecation. Lactulose is also used for\nthe treatment of hepatic encephalopathy, due to its ability to reduce ammonia levels.\n1567\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1568 ---\n\nD.  Stool softeners (emollient laxatives or surfactants)\nSurface active agents that become emulsified with the stool produce softer feces and ease passage of stool. These\ninclude docusate sodium and docusate calcium. They may take days to become effective and are often used for\nprophylaxis rather than acute treatment. Stool softeners should not be taken concomitantly with mineral oil  because\nof the potential for absorption of the mineral oil .\n1568\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1569 ---\n\nE.  Lubricant laxatives\nMineral oil  and glycerin suppositories are lubricants and act by facilitating the passage of hard stools. Mineral oil\nshould be taken orally in an upright position to avoid its aspiration and potential for lipid or lipoid pneumonia.\n1569\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1570 ---\n\nF.  Chloride channel activators\nLubiprostone [loo-bee-PROS-tone] works by activating chloride channels to increase fluid secretion in the intestinal\nlumen. This eases the passage of stools and causes little change in electrolyte balance. Lubiprostone is used in the\ntreatment of chronic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C), particularly because\ntolerance or dependency has not been associated with this drug. Also, drug–drug interactions are minimal because\nmetabolism occurs quickly in the stomach and jejunum.\n1570\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1571 ---\n\nVI.  Irritable Bowel Syndrome\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits in the absence\nof an organic cause. IBS may be classified as constipation predominant (IBS-C), diarrhea predominant (IBS-D), or a\ncombination of both. Diet and psychosocial modifications play an important role in management of the disease, as\nwell as drug therapy (Figure 40.14). Key characteristics of medications used for the treatment of IBS-C and IBS-D\nare provided in Figure 40.15.\nFigure 40.14 Summary of drugs used to treat irritable bowel syndrome. IBS-C = irritable\nbowel syndrome with constipation; IBS-D = irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea.\nFigure 40.15 Characteristics of drugs used to treat irritable bowel syndrome. cGMP =\ncyclic guanosine monophosphate; IBS-C = irritable bowel syndrome with constipation;\nIBS-D = irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea; GI = gastrointestinal. *Also indicated\nfor the treatment of chronic constipation.\n1571\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1572 ---\n\nVII.  Drugs Used to Treat Inflammatory Bowel Disease\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of idiopathic chronic intestinal conditions characterized by immune-\nmediated GI tract inflammation in response to bacterial antigens in the intestinal lumen. The most common subtypes\nof IBD are Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). CD can affect any portion of the GI tract from the\nmouth to the anus in a noncontinuous fashion and is characterized by transmural inflammation. UC usually affects\nthe rectum. It may extend continuously to affect other parts of the colon, and is characterized by inflammation\nlimited to the mucosal layer (Figure 40.16). Severity, extent of disease, and risk of complications guide treatment of\nIBD. Remission of IBD can be induced with the use of rectal and oral 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASAs), corticosteroids\n(rectal, oral locally delivered and systemic), and biologic agents (TNF-α inhibitors, α-4 integrin inhibitors, and the\nIL-12/23 inhibitor ustekinumab). Drugs used to maintain remission are the same as those used for induction. The\nimmunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and methotrexate) are additional agents used in the\nmaintenance of remission in IBD. Figure 40.17 summarizes agents used in the treatment of IBD.\nFigure 40.16 Distribution patterns of disease with (A) skip lesions in Crohn’s disease and\n(B) continuous involvement of the colon, beginning with the rectum, in ulcerative colitis.\n1572\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1573 ---\n\n1573\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1574 ---\n\nFigure 40.17 Agents used in the treatment of IBD.\n1574\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1575 ---\n\nA.  5-Aminosalicylates\nTwo types of 5-ASA compounds exist, the azo compounds and the mesalamine compounds. The azo compounds are\nprodrugs that consist of a 5-ASA molecule bound via an azo (N=N) bond to another molecule. These include\nbalsalazide [bal-SAL-a-zide], olsalazine [ole-SAL-a-zeen], and sulfasalazine [SUL-fa-SAL-a-zeen]. The oral\nmesalamine [me-SAL-a-meen] compounds consist of single 5-ASA molecules enclosed within an enteric coat or a\nsemipermeable membrane. The first 5-ASA agent used in the treatment of IBD, sulfasalazine, is a prodrug\nconsisting of 5-ASA linked to sulfapyridine. Colonic bacteria cleave sulfasalazine to produce 5-ASA (mesalamine)\nand sulfapyridine (Figure 40.18). When it became known that 5-ASA was responsible for the efficacy of\nsulfasalazine while sulfapyridine was mainly responsible for its adverse effects, unlinked 5-ASA formulations were\nproduced. However, unlinked 5-ASA is rapidly absorbed, with only 20% reaching the site of action in the terminal\nileum and colon. Therefore, other azo bonded compounds and various formulations of mesalamine were developed\nto limit absorption of 5-ASA in the proximal GI tract and allow increased drug delivery to the colon. These\nformulations differ in their sites of topical delivery within the intestinal tract and dosing frequency (Figure 40.19).\nCompared to sulfasalazine, the mesalamine formulations and the other azo compounds have improved tolerability\nwith similar efficacy, making them the mainstay of therapy in UC.\nFigure 40.18 Sulfasalazine metabolism.\nFigure 40.19 5-Aminosalicylate formulations.\n1.  Actions\nThe 5-ASAs exhibit anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties that are the main determinants of their\nefficacy in IBD. The exact mechanism of action of 5-ASA is unknown but is thought to be due in part to 1)\ninhibition of cytokine synthesis, 2) inhibition of leukotriene and prostaglandin synthesis, 3) scavenging of free\nradicals, 4) inhibition of T-cell proliferation, activation, and differentiation, and 5) impairment of leukocyte adhesion\nand function. 5-ASA is thought to act via topical interaction with the intestinal mucosa and the mechanisms are the\nsame with both oral and rectal administration.\n2.  Therapeutic uses\nThe 5-ASA drugs are the mainstay of treatment in UC. All 5-ASA formulations and sulfasalazine are indicated in\nUC for induction and maintenance of remission. Current guidelines recommend these agents as first line for mild–\nmoderate disease. Use of 5-ASA drugs in CD is limited due to a general lack of efficacy.1575\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1576 ---\n\n3.  Pharmacokinetics\n5-ASA (mesalamine) pharmacokinetics are variable and dependent on route of administration (for example, rectal\nvs. oral), type of oral formulation (see Figure 40.19), and disease activity. Absorption of 5-ASA increases with more\nsevere disease and decreases with decreasing pH. In UC, 5-ASAs work by local effect. Therefore, the 5-ASA\npreparations deliver drug to the colon for maximal intestinal exposure. Absorption of rectally administered\nmesalamine and systemic exposure depends on rectal retention time. Due to the topical mechanism of action,\ndifferences in systemic exposure are not related to efficacy but may be important for adverse effects. Sulfasalazine is\nadministered orally, with the sulfapyridine component having significant absorption (60% to 80%).\n3.  Adverse effects\nAdverse effects of sulfasalazine occur in up to 45% of patients, with the majority due to the sulfapyridine\ncomponent. Headache, nausea, and fatigue are most common and are dose related. Serious reactions include\nhemolytic anemia, myelosuppression, hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephrotoxicity, fever, rash, and Stevens-Johnson\nsyndrome. Treatment should be discontinued at the first sign of skin rash or hypersensitivity. Sulfasalazine\nreversibly impairs male fertility. Sulfasalazine also inhibits intestinal folate absorption, and folate supplementation is\nrecommended with chronic use. The newer mesalamine formulations are well tolerated; headache and dyspepsia are\nthe most common adverse effects. Rarely, acute interstitial nephritis may occur and renal function should be\nmonitored in patients receiving mesalamine. Watery diarrhea occurs in up to 20% of patients treated with olsalazine.\nSome formulations of mesalamine depend on pH for their release (see Figure 40.19) and coadministration of drugs\nthat increase pH (for example, PPIs, H2 receptor antagonists, and antacids) may result in increased systemic\nabsorption and premature release of 5-ASA before reaching the site of action. Concomitant use should be avoided or\nanother formulation of 5-ASA that is non-pH dependent should be used (for example, olsalazine, balsalazide).\n1576\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1577 ---\n\nB.

Enteric-release preparations of oral budesonide deliver corticosteroid to a portion of inflamed\nintestine. This agent has minimal systemic adverse effects due to low bioavailability resulting from extensive first-\npass hepatic metabolism.

Certolizumab [SER-toe-LIZ-oo-mab] is indicated for moderate–severe CD, and golimumab [goe-LIM-ue-mab]\nis indicated for moderate–severe UC. The TNF-α inhibitors are generally reserved as second-line agents in patients\nwith UC who have failed 5-ASAs, are unresponsive to or dependent on corticosteroids, or who present with more\nsevere disease. In CD, the TNF-α inhibitors have a first-line role in patients with moderate–severe disease and those\nat higher risk of progression and worse outcomes. These agents are associated with the development of\nimmunogenicity and antidrug antibodies that can result in loss of response in a significant proportion of patients.\n2.  α-4 integrin inhibitors\nα-4 Integrins are adhesion molecules that promote leukocyte migration to sites of inflammation. Use of α-4 integrin\ninhibitors reduces lymphocyte migration into the intestinal mucosa and inflammation. The use of α-4 integrin\ninhibitors in IBD is reserved for disease refractory to TNF-α inhibitors. Vedolizumab [VE-doe-LIZ-ue-mab] exhibits\nspecific binding to α-4/β-7 integrin and is indicated for refractory UC and CD.

She begins using cisplatin but\nbecomes nauseous and suffers from severe vomiting. Which drug would be most effective to counteract the\nemesis in this patient without exacerbating her cardiac problem?\nA.  Droperidol\nB.  Dolasetron\nC.  Prochlorperazine\nD.  Palonosetron\nCorrect answer = D. Palonosetron is a 5-HT3 antagonist that is effective against drugs with high emetogenic\nactivity, such as cisplatin. Although dolasetron is also in this category, its propensity to affect the heart makes it a\npoor choice for this patient. Droperidol is only a moderately effective antiemetic and has the potential to prolong\nthe QTc interval, so it is not preferred in this patient. The antiemetic effect of prochlorperazine, a phenothiazine,\nis most beneficial against anticancer drugs with moderate to low emetogenic properties.\nA 45-year-old woman complains of severe persistent heartburn and an unpleasant, acid-like taste in her\nmouth. The clinician suspects that she has gastroesophageal reflux disease. Which drug is most appropriate?\nA.  An antacid such as aluminum hydroxide\nB.  Dicyclomine\nC.  Granisetron\nD.  Esomeprazole\nCorrect answer = D. It is appropriate to treat this patient with a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) to reduce acid\nproduction and promote healing. An H2 receptor antagonist might also be effective, but the PPIs are preferred. An\nantacid would decrease gastric acid, but its effects are short lived compared to those of the PPIs and H2 receptor\nantagonists. Dicyclomine is an antimuscarinic drug that is mainly used as an antispasmodic for IBS. The 5-HT3\nreceptor antagonist granisetron is an antiemetic, and not appropriate for the treatment of GERD.\nA couple celebrating their 30th wedding anniversary are given a trip to Peru to visit Machu Picchu. Because\nof past experiences while traveling, they ask their doctor to prescribe an agent in case they experience\ndiarrhea. Which drug would be effective?\nA.  Omeprazole\nB.  Loperamide\nC.  Famotidine\nD.  Lubiprostone\nCorrect answer = B. Loperamide is the only drug that has antidiarrheal activity. Omeprazole is a proton-pump\ninhibitor, famotidine antagonizes the H2 receptor to reduce acid production, and lubiprostone is indicated for\nchronic constipation or IBS-C.\nA 27-year-old woman who is 34 weeks’ pregnant is on bed rest and is experiencing mild constipation. Which\ndrug is most appropriate for her?\nA.  Castor oil\nB.  Docusate\nC.  Mineral oil\nD.  Loperamide\nCorrect answer = B. Although its effects are not immediate, docusate may be used for mild constipation and is\ngenerally considered safe in pregnancy. Castor oil should not be used in pregnancy because of its ability to cause\nuterine contractions. Mineral oil should not be used in bedridden patients due to the possibility of aspiration.\nLoperamide is used for diarrhea, not constipation.\nWhich drug has been known to cause discoloration of the tongue?\nA.  Amoxicillin\nB.  Omeprazole\nC.  Bismuth subsalicylate\nD.  Lubiprostone\nCorrect answer = C. Bismuth subsalicylate compounds may cause a harmless black discoloration of the tongue.\nThe other agents have not been associated with this effect.\nAn elderly woman with a recent history of myocardial infarction is seeking a medication to help treat her\noccasional heartburn. She is currently taking several medications, including aspirin, clopidogrel, simvastatin,\nmetoprolol, and lisinopril. Which drug should be avoided in this patient?1580\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1581 ---\n\n40.7\n40.8\n40.9\n40.10A.  Calcium citrate\nB.  Famotidine\nC.  Omeprazole\nD.  Ranitidine\nCorrect answer = C. Omeprazole may possibly decrease the efficacy of clopidogrel because it inhibits the\nconversion of clopidogrel to its active form.\nExtrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) have been associated with which drug?\nA.  Metoclopramide\nB.  Sucralfate\nC.  Aprepitant\nD.  Bisacodyl\nCorrect answer = A. Only metoclopramide has been associated with EPS. This is due to its ability to inhibit\ndopamine activity.\nWhich agent for gastrointestinal problems is contraindicated in pregnancy?\nA.  Calcium carbonate\nB.  Famotidine\nC.  Lansoprazole\nD.  Misoprostol\nCorrect answer = D. Misoprostol, a synthetic prostaglandin analog, is contraindicated in pregnancy because it\nmay stimulate uterine contractions. The other medications may be used during pregnancy for the treatment of\nheartburn (common in pregnancy) or peptic ulcer disease.\nA patient presents with a 2-month history of crampy right lower quadrant abdominal pain. Results of\nendoscopy are consistent with moderate Crohn’s disease involving the terminal ileum and proximal large\nintestine. Which drug is best to initiate in this patient at this time?\nA.  Extended-release budesonide\nB.  Delayed-release budesonide\nC.  Mesalamine enema\nD.  Ustekinumab\nCorrect answer = B. Delayed-release budesonide is indicated in Crohn’s disease because it releases in the\nterminal ileum and proximal large bowel and is effective in inducing remission. Extended-release budesonide,\nalthough effective at inducing remission, is only indicated in ulcerative colitis because it does not release in the\nsmall bowel and would not be expected to be effective in this patient’s ileal disease. Mesalamine enema is only\neffective on the distal large intestine. Ustekinumab is only indicated in patients who are refractory or intolerant to\nTNF-α inhibitors.\nA patient with a history of ulcerative colitis well controlled on mesalamine (Apriso) presents with epigastric\npain and dark tarry stools. He is found to have a duodenal ulcer and is prescribed esomeprazole for 8 weeks.\nAt follow-up 2 weeks later, his epigastric pain and dark tarry stools are resolved. However, he reports having\nincreased lower abdominal pain and increased stool frequency. Which change in drug therapy is appropriate\nat this time?\nA.  Change esomeprazole to omeprazole due to interaction with mesalamine (Apriso).\nB.  Discontinue esomeprazole.\nC.  Change mesalamine (Apriso) to mesalamine (Asacol).\nD.  Change mesalamine (Apriso) to olsalazine (Dipentum).\nCorrect Answer = D. The patient seems to be having increased symptoms of ulcerative colitis after starting the\nPPI, esomeprazole. The pH-dependent release formulations of mesalamine have a significant interaction with the\nPPIs, which may lead to early release and loss of efficacy. A is incorrect because omeprazole is expected to have\nthe same interaction. B is incorrect because this patient still requires therapy with a PPI. C is incorrect because\nAsacol is also pH-dependent release and is likely to be affected. D is correct because olsalazine is not pH\ndependent and release relies on cleavage by colonic bacteria.1581\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1582 ---\n\n41\nDrugs for Urologic Disorders\nKatherine Vogel Anderson and Kaylie Smith\n1582\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1583 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nErectile dysfunction (ED) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) are common urologic disorders in males. ED is\nthe inability to maintain penile erection for the successful performance of sexual activity. ED has many physical and\npsychological causes, including vascular disease, diabetes, medications, depression, and sequelae to prostatic\nsurgery. It is estimated to affect more than 30 million men in the United States. BPH is nonmalignant enlargement of\nthe prostate, which occurs naturally as men age. As the prostate grows in size, lower urinary tract symptoms\ndevelop, which can significantly impact a patient's quality of life. A summary of drugs for ED and BPH is provided\nin Figure 41.1.\nFigure 41.1 Summary of drugs used for the treatment of urologic disorders.\n1583\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1584 ---\n\nII.  Drugs Used to Treat Erectile Dysfunction\nTherapy for ED includes penile implants, intrapenile injections of alprostadil , intraurethral suppositories of\nalprostadil , and oral phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors. Because of the efficacy, ease of use, and safety of\nPDE-5 inhibitors, these drugs are first-line therapy for ED.\n1584\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1585 ---\n\nA.  Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors\nFour PDE-5 inhibitors sildenafil  [sil-DEN-a-fil], vardenafil  [var-DEN-na-fil], tadalafil  [ta-DAL-a-fil], and avanafil\n[a-VAN-a-fil] are approved for the treatment of ED. [Note: Sildenafil  and tadalafil  are also indicated to treat\npulmonary hypertension, although the dosage regimen differs for this indication.] All four PDE-5 inhibitors are\nequally effective in treating ED, and the adverse effect profiles of the drugs are similar. However, these agents differ\nin the duration of action and the effects of food on drug absorption.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nSexual stimulation results in smooth muscle relaxation of the corpus cavernosum, increasing the inflow of blood\n(Figure 41.2). The mediator of this response is nitric oxide (NO). NO activates guanylyl cyclase, which forms cyclic\nguanosine monophosphate (cGMP) from guanosine triphosphate. cGMP produces smooth muscle relaxation through\na reduction in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. The duration of action of cyclic nucleotides is controlled by the\naction of PDE. At least 11 isozymes of PDE have been characterized. Sildenafil , vardenafil , tadalafil , and avanafil\ninhibit PDE-5, the isozyme responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. The action of PDE-5\ninhibitors is to increase the flow of blood into the corpus cavernosum at any given level of sexual stimulation. At\nrecommended doses, PDE-5 inhibitors have no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.\nFigure 41.2 Mechanism of penile erection. cGMP = cyclic guanosine monophosphate.\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\nSildenafil  and vardenafil  have similar pharmacokinetic properties. Both drugs should be taken approximately 1 hour\nprior to anticipated sexual activity, with erectile enhancement observed for up to 4 hours after administration. Thus,\nadministration of sildenafil  and vardenafil  must be timed appropriately with regard to anticipated sexual activity.\nThe absorption of both drugs is delayed by consumption of a high-fat meal. Vardenafil  is also available in an orally\ndisintegrating tablet (ODT) formulation, which is not affected by a high-fat meal. However, the bioavailability of the\nODT formulation may be decreased by water, and therefore, the ODT should be placed under the tongue and not\nadministered with liquids. The vardenafil  ODT provides a higher systemic bioavailability than the vardenafil  film-\ncoated oral tablet, and these products are not interchangeable. Tadalafil  has a slower onset of action ( Figure 41.3)\nthan sildenafil  and vardenafil , but a significantly longer half-life of approximately 18 hours. As such, it is approved\nfor once-daily dosing (in addition to as-needed dosing). This results in enhanced erectile function for up to 36 hours.\nFurthermore, the absorption of tadalafil  is not clinically influenced by food. The timing of sexual activity is less\ncritical for tadalafil  because of its prolonged duration of effect. Of all the PDE-5 inhibitors, avanafil  has the quickest\nonset of action. It should be taken 30 minutes prior to sexual activity. All PDE-5 inhibitors are metabolized by the\ncytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) isoenzyme. Dosage adjustments for sildenafil , tadalafil , and vardenafil  are\nrecommended in patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction. PDE-5 inhibitors should be avoided in patients\nwith severe hepatic impairment. For patients with severe renal dysfunction, the dose of sildenafil  and tadalafil\nshould be reduced, and daily-dose tadalafil  and as needed avanafil  are contraindicated in these patients.\n1585\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1586 ---\n\nFigure 41.3 Some properties of phosphodiesterase inhibitors. *Delay in time to reach\npeak drug concentration when taken with high-fat foods.\n3.  Adverse effects\nThe most frequent adverse effects of the PDE-5 inhibitors are headache, flushing, dyspepsia, and nasal congestion.\nThese effects are generally mild, and men with ED rarely discontinue treatment because of side effects. Disturbances\nin color vision (loss of blue/green discrimination) may occur with PDE-5 inhibitors, likely due to inhibition of PDE-\n6 (a PDE found in the retina that is important in color vision). Tadalafil , however, does not appear to disrupt PDE-6,\nand reports of changes in color vision have been rare with this medication. The incidence of these reactions appears\nto be dose dependent. Sudden hearing loss has also been reported with the use of PDE-5 inhibitors, perhaps due to\nchanges in sinus pressure because of vasodilation. Tadalafil  has been associated with back pain and myalgias, likely\nbecause of inhibition of PDE-11, an enzyme found in skeletal muscle. There is an inherent cardiac risk associated\nwith sexual activity. Therefore, PDE-5 inhibitors should be used with caution in patients with a history of\ncardiovascular disease or those with strong risk factors for cardiovascular disease. PDE-5 inhibitors should not be\nused more than once per day for the treatment of ED. All of the PDE-5 inhibitors have the potential to cause\npriapism (a painful, prolonged erection). Although this is a rare side effect, it is a medical emergency.1586\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1587 ---\n\n4.  Drug interactions\nBecause of the ability of PDE-5 inhibitors to potentiate the hypotensive activity of NO, administration of these\nmedications in combination with organic nitrates (for example, nitroglycerin products, isosorbide dinitrate, or\nisosorbide mononitrate) is contraindicated. PDE-5 inhibitors may produce additive blood pressure–lowering effects\nwhen used in patients taking α-adrenergic antagonists for treatment of hypertension and/or alleviation of symptoms\nassociated with BPH. The combination of PDE-5 inhibitors and α-adrenergic antagonists should be used with\ncaution. Patients should be on a stable dose of the α-adrenergic antagonist prior to the initiation of the PDE-5\ninhibitor, and the PDE-5 inhibitor should be started at a low dose if this combination is used. Doses of PDE-5\ninhibitors may need to be reduced in the presence of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as clarithromycin, ritonavir,\nand other protease inhibitors. Because of QT prolongation, the combination of vardenafil  and dronedarone should\nbe avoided.\n1587\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1588 ---\n\nB.  Alprostadil\nAlprostadil  [al-PRAHST-uh-dill] is synthetic prostaglandin E1 (PGE1). In the penile tissue, PGE1 allows for\nrelaxation of the smooth muscle in the corpus cavernosum. Alprostadil  is available as an intraurethral suppository\nand an injectable formulation. Although PDE-5 inhibitors are considered first-line therapy for the treatment of ED,\nalprostadil  may be used for patients who are not candidates for oral therapies. In contrast to oral agents, alprostadil\nacts locally, which may reduce the occurrence of adverse effects.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nAlprostadil  causes smooth muscle relaxation by an unknown mechanism. It is believed that alprostadil  increases\nconcentrations of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) within cavernosal tissue. As a result, protein kinase is\nactivated, allowing trabecular smooth muscle relaxation and dilation of cavernosal arteries. Increased blood flow to\nthe erection chamber compresses venous outflow, so that blood is entrapped and erection may occur.\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\nSystemic absorption of alprostadil  is minimal. If any alprostadil  is systemically absorbed, it is quickly metabolized.\nThe onset of action of alprostadil  is 5 to 10 minutes when given as a urethral suppository and 2 to 25 minutes when\nadministered by injection. The resulting erection may last for 30 to 60 minutes, or longer, depending upon the\nparticular patient.\n3.  Adverse effects\nSince alprostadil  is not systemically absorbed, adverse systemic effects are rare. However, hypotension or headache\nis a possibility due to PGE1-induced vasodilation. Locally, adverse effects of alprostadil  include penile pain,\nurethral pain, and testicular pain. Bleeding from the insertion or injection of alprostadil  is rare. Hematoma,\necchymosis, and rash are possible from alprostadil  injection, although these adverse effects are also rare. Alprostadil\nadministration may lead to priapism.\n1588\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1589 ---\n\nIII.  Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia\nThree classes of medications are used to treat BPH: α1-adrenergic antagonists, 5-α reductase inhibitors, and PDE-5\ninhibitors.\n1589\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1590 ---\n\nA.  α1-Adrenergic antagonists\nTerazosin [ter-AY-zoe-sin], doxazosin [dox-AY-zoe-sin], tamsulosin [tam-SUE-loh-sin], alfuzosin [al-FUE-zoe-\nsin], and silodosin [sil-oh-DOE-sin] are selective competitive blockers of the α1 receptor. All five agents are\nindicated for the treatment of BPH (Figure 41.1). Prazosin is an α-blocker that is used off-label in the treatment of\nBPH. However, current guidelines do not endorse the use of prazosin for BPH. Please refer to",

        "content": "Chapter 7 for a\ndiscussion of α-blockers in the setting of hypertension.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nα1A receptors are found in the prostate, α1B receptors are found in the prostate and vasculature, and α1D receptors are\nfound in the vasculature. By blocking the α1A and α1B receptors in the prostate, the α-blockers cause prostatic\nsmooth muscle relaxation, which leads to improved urine flow. Doxazosin, terazosin, and alfuzosin block α1A and\nα1B receptors, whereas tamsulosin and silodosin are more selective for the α1A receptor. Because doxazosin,\nterazosin, and alfuzosin block α1B receptors, these agents decrease peripheral vascular resistance and lower arterial\nblood pressure by causing relaxation of both arterial and venous smooth muscle. In contrast, tamsulosin and\nsilodosin have less of an effect on blood pressure because they are more selective for the prostate-specific α1A\nreceptor.\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\nThe α-blockers are well absorbed following oral administration. When taken with food, the absorption of\ntamsulosin, alfuzosin, and silodosin is increased. Therefore, for best efficacy, these agents should be taken with food\nor after a meal, typically supper. Doxazosin, alfuzosin, tamsulosin, and silodosin are metabolized through the\ncytochrome P450 system. Silodosin is also a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Terazosin is metabolized in the\nliver, but not through the CYP system. In general, the α-blockers have a half-life of 8 to 22 hours, with peak effects\n1 to 4 hours after administration. Silodosin requires dosage adjustment in renal impairment and is contraindicated in\npatients with severe renal dysfunction.\n3.  Adverse effects\nα-Blockers may cause dizziness, a lack of energy, nasal congestion, headache, drowsiness, and orthostatic\nhypotension. Because tamsulosin and silodosin are more selective for the α1A receptors found on the smooth muscle\nof the prostate, they have relatively minimal effects on blood pressure, although dizziness and orthostasis may occur.\nBy blocking α receptors in the ejaculatory ducts and impairing smooth muscle contraction, inhibition of ejaculation\nand retrograde ejaculation have been reported. Several of these agents have a caution about “floppy iris syndrome,”\na condition in which the iris billows in response to intraoperative eye surgery (Figure 41.4).\n1590\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1591 ---\n\nFigure 41.4 Some adverse effects commonly observed with nonselective α-blockers.\n4.  Drug interactions\nDrugs that inhibit CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 (for example, verapamil , diltiazem) may increase the plasma\nconcentrations of doxazosin, alfuzosin, tamsulosin, and silodosin, whereas drugs that induce the CYP450 system (for\n1591\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1592 ---\n\nexample, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John's wort ) may decrease plasma concentrations. Alfuzosin may\nprolong the QT interval, so it should be used with caution with other drugs that cause QT prolongation (for example,\nclass III antiarrhythmics). Because silodosin is a substrate for P-gp, drugs that inhibit P-gp, such as cyclosporine,\nmay increase silodosin concentrations.\n1592\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1593 ---\n\nB.  5-α Reductase inhibitors\nFinasteride [fin-AS-ter-ide] and dutasteride [doo-TAS-ter-ride] inhibit 5-α reductase. Compared to the α-blockers,\nwhich provide patients with relief from BPH symptoms within 7 to 10 days, these agents may take up to 12 months\nto relieve symptoms.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nBoth finasteride and dutasteride inhibit the enzyme 5-α reductase, which is responsible for converting testosterone\nto the more active dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is an androgen that stimulates prostate growth. By reducing\nDHT, the prostate shrinks and urine flow improves. Compared with finasteride, dutasteride is more potent and\ncauses a greater decrease in DHT. In order for the 5-α reductase inhibitors to be effective, the prostate must be\nenlarged. Since it takes several months for 5-α reductase inhibitors to reduce the prostate size, it is appropriate to use\nthese agents in combination with an α-blocker to provide relief of symptoms. Dutasteride and tamsulosin are\navailable as a combination product for this indication. Figures 41.5 and 41.6 summarize important differences\nbetween these two classes of agents. Finasteride and dutasteride are also used for alopecia, since a reduction in\nscalp and serum DHT prevents hair loss.\nFigure 41.5 Therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).\nFigure 41.6 Comparisons of treatment for BPH. PSA = prostate-specific antigen.\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\nFood does not affect the absorption of finasteride or dutasteride. Both agents are highly protein bound and\nmetabolized by the CYP450 system. The mean plasma elimination half-life of finasteride is 6 to 16 hours, while the\nterminal elimination half-life of dutasteride is 5 weeks once steady-state concentrations are achieved (which is\ntypically after 6 months of therapy).\n3.  Adverse effects\nThe 5-α reductase inhibitors cause sexual side effects, such as decreased ejaculate, decreased libido, ED,\ngynecomastia, and oligospermia. Finasteride and dutasteride are teratogenic. Women who are pregnant or of\nchildbearing age should not handle or ingest either agent, as this may lead to serious birth defects involving the\ngenitalia in a male fetus. Although both agents are metabolized by the CYP450 system, drug interactions are rare. It\nis not ideal to use a 5-α reductase inhibitor with testosterone, since both finasteride and dutasteride inhibit the\nconversion of testosterone to its active form, DHT.1593\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1594 ---\n\n1594\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1595 ---\n\nC.  Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor\nTadalafil  is the only PDE-5 inhibitor approved for the treatment of BPH. PDE-5 is present in the prostate and\nbladder. As such, inhibition of PDE-5 by tadalafil  allows for vasodilation and relaxation of the smooth muscle of the\nprostate and bladder, which thereby improves symptoms of BPH.\n1595\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1596 ---\n\n41.1\n41.2\n41.3\n41.4\n41.5\n41.6Study Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nWhich is CORRECT regarding the mechanism of action of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors?\nA.  PDE-5 inhibitors increase prostaglandin production.\nB.  PDE-5 inhibitors enhance the effect of nitric oxide.\nC.  PDE-5 inhibitors cause vasoconstriction of the erection chamber.\nD.  PDE-5 inhibitors antagonize cyclic GMP.\nCorrect answer = B. PDE-5 inhibitors enhance the effect of nitric oxide by preventing the breakdown of cGMP.\nPDE-5 inhibitors do not affect prostaglandin production. Although blood is drawn to the erection chamber, PDE-\n5 inhibitors allow for this via vasodilation, not vasoconstriction. PDE-5 inhibitors prevent the breakdown of\ncGMP but do not antagonize its action.\nWhen selecting between the available PDE-5 inhibitors for treatment of ED, which is an important\nconsideration?\nA.  Tadalafil has the shortest half-life of the PDE-5 inhibitors.\nB.  Sildenafil should be given with food to increase absorption.\nC.  Vardenafil ODT doses are not equal to film-coated vardenafil doses.\nD.  Avanafil should be taken at least 1 hour before intercourse.\nCorrect answer = C. The ODT dosage form of vardenafil provides a high systemic concentration of vardenafil,\nwhich is higher than that provided by the film-coated tablets. As such, the doses are not interchangeable. Tadalafil\nhas the longest half-life of all PDE-5 inhibitors. Food may delay sildenafil absorption. Avanafil has the quickest\nonset of action and may be taken 30 minutes before intercourse.\nA patient who is taking a PDE-5 inhibitor for ED is diagnosed with angina. Which antianginal medication\nwould be of particular concern in this patient?\nA.  Metoprolol\nB.  Diltiazem\nC.  Amlodipine\nD.  Nitroglycerin\nCorrect answer = D. Nitrates, such as nitroglycerin, can cause life-threatening hypotension when taken with PDE-\n5 inhibitors. While metoprolol, diltiazem, and amlodipine may all lower blood pressure, the interaction with PDE-\n5 inhibitors is not relevant.\nWhich BEST describes the mechanism of action of alprostadil?\nA.  Alprostadil blocks cGMP.\nB.  Alprostadil blocks nitric oxide.\nC.  Alprostadil increases PDE-5.\nD.  Alprostadil increases cAMP.\nCorrect answer = D. Through an unknown mechanism, alprostadil (a synthetic prostaglandin) increases levels of\ncAMP, causing smooth muscle relaxation. Alprostadil does not affect cGMP, nitric oxide, or PDE-5.\nWhich is CORRECT regarding local administration of alprostadil?\nA.  Local administration of alprostadil allows for low systemic absorption.\nB.  Local administration of alprostadil increases the chance of drug interactions.\nC.  Local administration of alprostadil is accomplished by application of a cream.\nD.  Local administration of alprostadil causes changes in color vision.\nCorrect answer = A. Local administration of alprostadil allows for minimal systemic absorption. This makes\nalprostadil associated with few drug interactions. Alprostadil is administered by injection or urethral suppository,\nnot a cream. Because there is little systemic absorption, and alprostadil does not affect PDE-6, changes in color\nvision are not likely.\nWhich is the BEST description of the mechanism of action of dutasteride?\nA.  Dutasteride blocks 5-α reductase.\nB.  Dutasteride blocks α1A receptors.\nC.  Dutasteride blocks PDE-5.\nD.  Dutasteride blocks α1A and α1B receptors.\nCorrect answer = A. Dutasteride blocks 5-α reductase. Dutasteride does not affect α1A receptors, α1B receptors, or\nPDE-5.1596\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1597 ---\n\n41.7\n41.8\n41.9\n41.10A patient is worried about starting terazosin because he is very sensitive to side effects of medications.\nWhich adverse effect would be most expected in this patient?\nA.  Erectile dysfunction\nB.  Gynecomastia\nC.  Dizziness\nD.  Vomiting\nCorrect answer = C. Because of the α-blocking properties, terazosin commonly causes dizziness (this may be\nrelated to orthostatic hypotension). ED and gynecomastia would be unexpected with α-blockers. While most any\ndrug may cause nausea and vomiting, terazosin is much more likely to cause dizziness.\nWhich describes an important difference between terazosin and tamsulosin?\nA.  Terazosin blocks α1A receptors, whereas tamsulosin blocks α1A and α1B receptors.\nB.  Terazosin blocks α1A and α1B receptors, whereas tamsulosin blocks α1A receptors.\nC.  Terazosin blocks 5-α reductase, whereas tamsulosin blocks PDE-5.\nD.  Terazosin must be taken with food, whereas tamsulosin can be taken on an empty stomach.\nCorrect answer = B. Tamsulosin is more selective for the α1A receptor, found in the prostate. Terazosin blocks\nα1A; however, terazosin also blocks α1B. Neither one blocks 5-α reductase nor PDE-5. Tamsulosin should be\ntaken with food, while terazosin does not need to be taken with food.\nWhich is CORRECT regarding finasteride?\nA.  Finasteride is associated with significant hypotension.\nB.  Finasteride is associated with birth defects.\nC.  Finasteride is effective within 2 weeks of initiation.\nD.  Finasteride is renally eliminated.\nCorrect answer = B. Because finasteride inhibits the conversion of testosterone to its active form, it may cause\nsignificant developmental defects in the male genitalia of a developing fetus. As such, it is contraindicated in\npregnancy. Unlike the α-blockers, the 5-α reductase inhibitors are not associated with hypotension. Finasteride\nmay take up to 12 months before it is effective. Finasteride is metabolized via CYP450 and is not renally\neliminated.\nA 70-year-old man with BPH and an enlarged prostate continues to have urinary symptoms after an adequate\ntrial of tamsulosin. Dutasteride is added to his therapy. In addition to tamsulosin, he is also taking\nhydrochlorothiazide, testosterone, and vardenafil as needed before intercourse. Which of his medications\ncould have an interaction with dutasteride?\nA.  Hydrochlorothiazide\nB.  Tamsulosin\nC.  Testosterone\nD.  Vardenafil\nCorrect answer = C. Because dutasteride prevents the conversion of testosterone to the more active form, DHT,\nthese medications have an interaction. Essentially, dutasteride prevents testosterone from “working.”\nHydrochlorothiazide does not interfere with the metabolism of dutasteride, and dutasteride does not have any\neffect on the blood pressure–lowering effects of hydrochlorothiazide. Tamsulosin is appropriate in combination\nwith a 5-α reductase inhibitor when the prostate is enlarged. Vardenafil is only prescribed as needed, and the two\ndrugs do not have a pharmacokinetic interaction.1597\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1598 ---\n\n42\nDrugs for Anemia\nLori Dupree\n1598\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1599 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nAnemia is defined as a below-normal plasma hemoglobin concentration resulting from a decreased number of\ncirculating red blood cells or an abnormally low total hemoglobin content per unit of blood volume. General signs\nand symptoms of anemia include fatigue, palpitations, shortness of breath, pallor, dizziness, and insomnia. Anemia\ncan be caused by chronic blood loss, bone marrow abnormalities, hemolysis, infections, malignancy, endocrine\ndeficiencies, renal failure, and a number of other disease states. A large number of drugs cause toxic effects on\nblood cells, hemoglobin production, or erythropoietic organs, which, in turn, may cause anemia. Nutritional anemias\nare caused by dietary deficiencies of substances such as iron, folic acid, and vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) that are\nnecessary for normal erythropoiesis. Individuals with a genetic predisposition to anemia, such as sickle cell disease,\ncan benefit from pharmacologic treatment with actions beyond nutritional supplementation, such as hydroxyurea.\nAnemia can be temporarily corrected by transfusion of whole blood. A summary of agents used for the treatment of\nanemias is provided in Figure 42.1.\nFigure 42.1 Summary of drugs for the treatment of anemia.\n1599\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1600 ---\n\nII.  Agents Used to Treat Anemias\n1600\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1601 ---\n\nA.  Iron\nIron is stored in the intestinal mucosal cells, liver, spleen, and bone marrow as ferritin (an iron–protein complex) and\ndelivered to the marrow for hemoglobin production by transferrin, a transport protein. Iron deficiency, the most\ncommon nutritional deficiency, results from a negative iron balance due to depletion of iron stores and/or inadequate\nintake, such as acute or chronic blood loss, menstruating or pregnant women, or periods of accelerated growth in\nchildren. In addition to general signs and symptoms of anemia, iron deficiency anemia may cause pica (hunger for\nice, dirt, paper, etc.), koilonychias (upward curvature of the finger and toe nails), and soreness and cracking at the\ncorners of the mouth.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nSupplementation with elemental iron corrects the iron deficiency. The CDC recommends 150 to 180 mg/day of oral\nelemental iron administered in divided doses two to three times daily for patients with iron deficiency anemia.\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\nIron is absorbed after oral administration. Acidic conditions in the stomach keep iron in the reduced ferrous form,\nwhich is the more soluble form. Iron is then absorbed in the duodenum. [Note: The amount absorbed depends on the\ncurrent body stores of iron. If iron stores are adequate, less iron is absorbed. If stores are low, more iron is\nabsorbed.] The relative percentage of iron absorbed decreases with increasing doses. Oral preparations include\nferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, ferrous gluconate, polysaccharide–iron complex, and carbonyl iron formulations.\nThe percentage of elemental iron varies in each oral iron preparation (Figure 42.2). Parenteral formulations of iron,\nsuch as iron dextran, sodium ferric gluconate, ferumoxytol , ferric carboxymaltose, and iron sucrose, are also\navailable. While parenteral administration treats iron deficiency rapidly, oral administration may take several weeks.\nFigure 42.2 Characteristics of various iron formulations.\n3.  Adverse effects\nGastrointestinal (GI) disturbances caused by local irritation (abdominal pain, constipation, nausea, diarrhea) and\ndark stools are the most common adverse effects of oral iron supplements. Parenteral iron formulations may be used\nin those who cannot tolerate or inadequately absorb oral iron, as well as those receiving erythropoietin with\nhemodialysis or chemotherapy. Fatal hypersensitivity and anaphylactoid reactions can occur in patients receiving\nparenteral iron (mainly iron dextran formulations). A test dose should be administered prior to iron dextran. In\naddition, intravenous iron should be used cautiously in the presence of active infections. [Note: Iron is essential for\nbacterial growth.]\n1601\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1602 ---\n\nB.  Folic acid (folate)\nThe primary use of folic acid is in treating deficiency states that arise from inadequate levels of the vitamin. Folate\ndeficiency may be caused by 1) increased demand (for example, pregnancy and lactation), 2) poor absorption caused\nby pathology of the small intestine, 3) alcoholism, or 4) treatment with drugs that are dihydrofolate reductase\ninhibitors (for example, methotrexate and trimethoprim), drugs that directly inhibit DNA synthesis (for example,\nazathioprine and zidovudine), or drugs that reduce folate absorption (for example, phenytoin and phenobarbital ). A\nprimary result of folic acid deficiency is megaloblastic anemia (large-sized red blood cells), which is caused by\ndiminished synthesis of purines and pyrimidines. This leads to an inability of erythropoietic tissue to make DNA\nand, thereby, proliferate ( Figure 42.3). [Note: To avoid neurological complications of vitamin B12 deficiency, it is\nimportant to evaluate the basis of the megaloblastic anemia prior to instituting therapy. Both vitamin B12 and folate\ndeficiency can cause similar symptoms.]\n1602\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1603 ---\n\n1603\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1604 ---\n\nFigure 42.3 Causes and consequences of folic acid depletion.\nFolic acid is rapidly absorbed in the jejunum unless abnormal pathology is present. Oral folic acid administration is\nnontoxic and at high doses, excess vitamin is excreted in the urine. Rare hypersensitivity reactions to parenteral\ninjections have been reported.\n1604\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1605 ---\n\nC.  Cyanocobalamin and hydroxocobalamin (vitamin B 12)\nDeficiencies of vitamin B12 can result from either low dietary levels or, more commonly, poor absorption of the\nvitamin due to the failure of gastric parietal cells to produce intrinsic factor (as in pernicious anemia), or a loss of\nactivity of the receptor needed for intestinal uptake of the vitamin. Nonspecific malabsorption syndromes or gastric\nresection can also cause vitamin B12 deficiency. In addition to general signs and symptoms of anemia, vitamin B12\ndeficiency anemia may cause tingling (pins and needles) in the hands and feet, difficulty walking, dementia, and, in\nextreme cases, hallucinations, paranoia, or schizophrenia. [Note: Folic acid administration alone reverses the\nhematologic abnormality and, thus, masks the vitamin B12 deficiency, which can then proceed to severe neurologic\ndysfunction and disease. The cause of megaloblastic anemia needs to be determined in order to be specific in terms\nof treatment. Therefore, megaloblastic anemia should not be treated with folic acid alone but, rather, with a\ncombination of folic acid and vitamin B12.]\nThe vitamin may be administered orally (for dietary deficiencies), intramuscularly, or deep subcutaneously (for\npernicious anemia). Intramuscular hydroxocobalamin [hye-drox-oh-koe-BAL-a-min] is preferred since it has a rapid\nresponse, is highly protein bound, and maintains longer plasma levels. In patients with malabsorption, such as in\nbariatric surgery (surgical treatment for obesity), vitamin B12 supplementation as cyanocobalamin [sye-an-oh-koe-\nBAL-a-min] is required daily in high oral doses or monthly by the parenteral route. This vitamin is nontoxic even in\nlarge doses. In pernicious anemia, therapy must be continued for life.\n1605\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1606 ---\n\nD.  Erythropoietin and darbepoetin\nPeritubular cells in the kidneys respond to hypoxia and synthesize and release erythropoietin [ee-rith-ro-POI-eh-tin;\nEPO], a glycoprotein. EPO stimulates stem cells to differentiate into proerythroblasts and promotes the release of\nreticulocytes from the marrow and initiation of hemoglobin formation. Thus, EPO regulates red blood cell\nproliferation and differentiation in bone marrow. Human erythropoietin (epoetin alfa), produced by recombinant\nDNA technology, is effective in the treatment of anemia caused by end-stage renal disease, human\nimmunodeficiency virus infection, bone marrow disorders, prematurity, and malignancy. A long-acting form of\nerythropoietin, darbepoetin [dar-be-POE-e-tin], has a half-life about three times that of epoetin alfa due to the\naddition of two carbohydrate chains. These agents are well tolerated and are administered intravenously in renal\ndialysis patients or subcutaneously for other indications. Side effects such as blood pressure elevation and arthralgia\nmay occur in some cases. [Note: The former may be due to increases in peripheral vascular resistance and/or blood\nviscosity.] In addition, iron supplementation may be required to ensure an adequate response.\nWhen epoetin alfa is used to target hemoglobin concentrations over 11 g/dL, serious cardiovascular events (such\nas thrombosis and severe hypertension), increased risk of death, shortened time to tumor progression, and decreased\nsurvival have been observed. The recommendations for all patients receiving epoetin alfa or darbepoetin include a\nminimum effective dose that does not exceed a hemoglobin level of 12 g/dL, and a hemoglobin level that does not\nrise by more than 1 g/dL over a 2-week period. Additionally, if the hemoglobin level exceeds 10 g/dL, doses of\nepoetin alfa or darbepoetin should be reduced or treatment should be discontinued. Neither agent has any value in\nthe acute treatment of anemia due to their delayed onset of action.\n1606\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1607 ---\n\nIII.  Agents Used to Treat Neutropenia\nMyeloid growth factors or granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF), such as filgrastim [fil-GRAS-tim], tbo-\nfilgrastim, and pegfilgrastim [peg-fil-GRAS-tim], and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors (GM-\nCSF), such as sargramostim [sar-GRA-moe-stim], stimulate granulocyte production in the marrow to increase\nneutrophil counts and reduce the duration of severe neutropenia. These agents are typically used prophylactically to\nreduce the risk of neutropenia following chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation. Filgrastim and\nsargramostim can be dosed either subcutaneously or intravenously, whereas tbo-filgrastim and pegfilgrastim are\ndosed subcutaneously only. The main difference between the available agents is in the frequency of dosing.\nFilgrastim, tbo-filgrastim, and sargramostim are dosed once a day beginning 24 to 72 hours after chemotherapy,\nuntil the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) reaches 5000 to 10,000/μL. Pegfilgrastim is a pegylated form of G-CSF,\nresulting in a longer half-life when compared to the other agents, and is administered 24 hours after chemotherapy,\nas a single dose, rather than once daily. Monitoring of ANC is typically not necessary with pegfilgrastim. There is\nno evidence to show superiority of one agent over another in terms of efficacy, safety, or tolerability. Bone pain is a\ncommon adverse effect with these agents.\n1607\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1608 ---\n\nIV.  Agents Used to Treat Sickle Cell Disease\n1608\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1609 ---\n\nA.  Hydroxyurea\nHydroxyurea [hye-DROX-ee-yoo-ree-ah] is an oral ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor that can reduce the frequency\nof painful sickle cell crises ( Figure 42.4). In sickle cell disease, hydroxyurea increases fetal hemoglobin (HbF)\nlevels, thus diluting the abnormal hemoglobin S (HbS). Polymerization of HbS is delayed and reduced in treated\npatients, so that painful crises are not caused by sickled cells blocking capillaries and causing tissue anoxia. A\nclinical response may take three to six months. Important side effects of hydroxyurea include bone marrow\nsuppression and cutaneous vasculitis. It is important that hydroxyurea is administered under the supervision of a\nprovider experienced in the treatment of sickle cell disease. Hydroxyurea is also used off-label to treat acute\nmyelogenous leukemia, psoriasis, and polycythemia vera.\nFigure 42.4 Effect of treatment with hydroxyurea on the percentage of sickle cell patients\nexperiencing first painful episode.\nFigure 42.5 provides a summary of medications used in the management of anemia.\n1609\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1610 ---\n\nFigure 42.5 Medications for the management of anemia.

Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin)\nB.  Folic acid\nC.  Vitamin D\nD.  Iron\nCorrect answer = D. Vitamin B12, folic acid, and iron deficiencies all contribute to anemia, but iron deficiency is\nassociated with pica (hunger for ice or dirt) and koilonychias (upward curvature of toenails/fingernails). Vitamin\nD deficiency does exist but does not cause anemia.\nWhich iron supplement contains the highest percentage of elemental iron?\nA.  Ferrous sulfate\nB.  Carbonyl iron\nC.  Ferrous gluconate\nD.  Ferric ammonium citrate\nCorrect answer = B. Ferrous sulfate contains 20% (or 30% in the anhydrous formulation), ferrous gluconate\ncontains 12%, and ferric ammonium citrate contains 18% of elemental iron. These are all well below the percent\nof elemental iron in carbonyl iron, which contains 100% elemental iron.\nA 56-year-old woman is discovered to have megaloblastic anemia. Her past medical history is significant for\nalcoholism. Which would be the best treatment option for this patient?\nA.  Oral vitamin B12\nB.  Parenteral vitamin B12\nC.  Oral folic acid\nD.  Oral vitamin B12 with oral folic acid\nCorrect answer = D. The patient has a history of alcoholism, which would suggest folic acid deficiency anemia.\nHowever, folic acid administration alone reverses the hematologic abnormality and masks possible vitamin B12\ndeficiency, which can then proceed to severe neurologic dysfunction and disease. The cause of megaloblastic\nanemia needs to be determined in order to be specific in terms of treatment. Therefore, megaloblastic anemia\nshould not be treated with folic acid alone but, rather, with a combination of folic acid and vitamin B12.\nA 60-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician complaining of dizziness and fatigue.\nFollowing laboratory testing, the patient is diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia, and oral iron\nsupplementation is needed. Which would be the most appropriate dosing regimen for the patient?\nA.  Ferrous fumarate 325 mg once daily\nB.  Ferrous gluconate 256 mg once daily\nC.  Polysaccharide–iron complex 150 mg two to three times daily\nD.  Ferrous sulfate 325 mg two to three times daily\nCorrect answer = D. The recommended dose of iron supplementation in iron deficiency anemia is typically about\n150 mg of elemental iron in two to three divided doses. Extended-release formulations (such as polysaccharide–\niron complex) may be dosed once daily. Ferrous sulfate 325 mg contains approximately 65 mg of elemental iron,\nferrous fumarate 325 mg contains about 107 mg elemental iron, ferrous gluconate 256 mg contains approximately\n30 mg elemental iron, and polysaccharide–iron complex 150 mg contains 150 mg elemental iron.\nA 63-year-old female patient with anemia secondary to chronic kidney disease and a hemoglobin level of 8.6\ng/dL is treated with epoetin alfa. Eight days after the initial dose of epoetin alfa, the patient’s hemoglobin is\n10.5 g/dL. Which would be the next step in the management of this patient’s anemia?\nA.  Discontinue epoetin alfa\nB.  Discontinue epoetin alfa and initiate darbepoetin\nC.  Continue epoetin alfa\nD.  Increase the dose of epoetin alfa\nCorrect answer = A. Hemoglobin has increased to more than 10 g/dL and more than 1 g/dL in 2 weeks, so epoetin\nalfa should be discontinued or the dose reduced. Switching to darbepoetin, continuing epoetin alfa, or increasing\nthe dose of epoetin alfa would continue to increase hemoglobin and lead to increased risk of cardiovascular\nevents.\nWhich drug would be beneficial to reduce the frequency of painful crises in a patient with sickle cell\ndisease?1611\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1612 ---\n\n42.7\n42.8\n42.9\n42.10A.  Epoetin alfa\nB.  Filgrastim\nC.  Hydroxyurea\nD.  Sargramostim\nCorrect answer = C. Clinical evidence supports the use of hydroxyurea for reducing the frequency and severity of\npainful sickle cell crises during the course of sickle cell disease. Epoetin alfa helps increase hemoglobin and red\nblood cell production in anemias secondary to chronic kidney disease, HIV, bone marrow disorders, and other\ndisorders. Filgrastim and sargramostim stimulate granulocyte production in the marrow to increase the neutrophil\ncounts and reduce the duration of severe neutropenia.\nAfter completing his last cycle of chemotherapy, a 68-year-old man received a dose of pegfilgrastim\nprophylactically to reduce his risk of neutropenia. Twenty-four hours later, he returned to clinic to receive an\nadditional dose of pegfilgrastim and was told he did not need another dose. Which would explain the\nrationale behind this recommendation?\nA.  Absolute neutrophil count is above 1000/μL\nB.  Pegfilgrastim is given as single dose\nC.  Next dose of pegfilgrastim is due 72 hours after the first dose\nD.  Next dose of pegfilgrastim is due 48 hours after the first dose\nCorrect answer = B. Pegfilgrastim is a pegylated form of G-CSF and has a longer half-life; therefore, it is\nadministered as a single dose with no additional doses needed. Monitoring of the ANC is not necessary with\npegfilgrastim due to the pharmacokinetics of the drug.\nA patient has been taking ferrous sulfate 325 mg twice daily for two weeks and is complaining of a bad taste\nafter each dose. Which once-daily, oral iron formulations would improve tolerability and provide a similar\ntotal daily dose of elemental iron as twice-daily ferrous sulfate?\nA.  Ferric ammonium citrate 25 mg\nB.  Ferrous gluconate 100 mg\nC.  Ferrous sulfate, anhydrous 142 mg\nD.  Polysaccharide–iron complex 150 mg\nCorrect answer = D. Once-daily polysaccharide–iron complex (150 mg = 150 mg elemental iron) is tasteless and\nodorless, with a similar total daily dose of elemental iron as ferrous sulfate 325 mg twice daily (130 mg elemental\niron/day). Once-daily ferric ammonium citrate 25 mg (4.5 mg elemental iron) is less bioavailable than twice-daily\nferrous sulfate. Ferrous sulfate and ferrous gluconate have similar tolerability, but once-daily ferrous gluconate\nhas less elemental iron (12 mg elemental iron). Ferrous sulfate, anhydrous has better tolerability with the\nextended-release formulation, but has less elemental iron (43 mg elemental iron) administered once daily\ncompared to twice daily ferrous sulfate.\nWhich patient with iron deficiency anemia would need the parenteral form of iron replacement?\nA.  22-year-old woman with heavy menstrual periods\nB.  58-year-old man with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis\nC.  32-year-old woman in the first trimester of pregnancy\nD.  40-year-old man with a diabetic foot infection\nCorrect answer = B. Clinical evidence supports the use of parenteral iron over oral iron in hemodialysis patients\ndue to a significantly greater increase in hemoglobin levels and lower incidence of treatment-related adverse\nevents. Parenteral iron is also preferred in patients who cannot tolerate oral iron or who have iron malabsorption.\nPatients with heavy menstrual periods, who are pregnant, or who have chronic disease states, such as diabetes,\nand infections, should be administered an initial trial of oral iron.\nAn 81-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with progressive weakness, fatigue, confusion,\nand reports of seeing people in her house who were trying to hurt her but who were not physically present.\nHer physical exam was positive for pallor but negative for koilonychias or cracking at the corners of the\nmouth. Which deficiency would be the highest priority in this patient’s workup?\nA.  Vitamin B12\nB.  Iron\nC.  Folate\nD.  Calcium\nCorrect answer = A. Based on the presentation of confusion and hallucinations, vitamin B12 deficiency should be\nconsidered the highest priority. Second priority would be to assess folate deficiency, since symptoms are similar\nto vitamin B12 deficiency. Iron would be the third priority due to the patient’s age, even without the presence of\nkoilonychias or cracking of the mouth. Last priority would be to assess age-related deficiencies in calcium, which\ncould lead to fatigue as well as muscle cramps, poor appetite, and abnormal heart rhythms.1612\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1613 ---\n\n1613\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1614 ---\n\n43\nDrugs for Dermatologic Disorders\nStacey Curtis and Cary Mobley\n1614\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1615 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nThe skin is a complex and dynamic organ comprised of cells, tissues, and biomolecules that coordinate to provide\nmany interdependent functions, including protection from environmental insults from noxious chemicals, infectious\npathogens, and ultraviolet radiation, as well as serving vital functions in wound repair, sensation, thermoregulation,\nand vitamin D synthesis. This chapter focuses on drugs that are used for some of the more common skin conditions\nincluding psoriasis, acne, rosacea, infections, pigmentation disorders, and alopecia. Drugs for acne, superficial\nbacterial infections, and rosacea are summarized in Figure 43.1. [Note: Agents for fungal infections of the skin are\ncovered in the chapter on antifungals (see",

Topical Preparations\nThe skin is composed of two main layers, the epidermis and the dermis (Figure 43.2). The epidermis is composed of\nseveral layers of keratinocytes, with the outermost layer, the stratum corneum, serving as the primary barrier to\nexternal insults. The dermis, located between the epidermis and the subcutaneous tissue, is composed of connective\ntissue and contains many specialized structures, such as sweat glands, sebaceous glands, hair follicles, and blood\nvessels. Defects in skin structure and function induced by genetics and by environmental insults can lead to\nnumerous dermatological conditions, many of which can be controlled or cured with the use of drug therapy.\nFigure 43.2 Cross section of the skin.\nUse of topical agents for treatment of dermatologic disorders is not only convenient but also can minimize systemic\nadverse effects. Common topical dosage forms include sprays, powders, lotions, creams, pastes, gels, ointments, and\nfoams. The choice of which dosage form to use for a particular condition involves factors such as occlusiveness,\nease of application, patient acceptance, and drug potency. The choice also includes consideration of stratum\ncorneum thickness and integrity, as well as the type, location, and extent of the lesions being treated.\n1617\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1618 ---\n\nIII.  Agents for Acne\nAcne vulgaris (common acne) is a common skin disorder that occurs in about 85% of individuals 12 to 24 years of\nage, coinciding with an increase in androgen production.

Normal sebaceous gland and hair follicle. B. Comedone\nformation. C. Pustule formation.\nThe sebum serves as a nutrient for the proliferation of Propionibacterium acnes , which along with other factors,\ntriggers an inflammatory response that causes the formation of a pustule or papule—the pimple. If this progresses,\nthe follicular wall can rupture, leading to the formation of an inflamed nodule. Different medications can be used\nalone or in combination to affect one or more of these pathological components to clear the acne lesions.\n1618\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1619 ---\n\nA.  Antibiotics\nTopical and oral antibiotics are commonly used in acne, with oral antibiotics reserved for moderate-to-severe acne.\nThe use of antibiotics in acne is based not only on their antibacterial effects but also on anti-inflammatory\nproperties, which can be significant for some antibiotics, such as the tetracyclines. The most common topical\nantibiotics used are clindamycin [klin-da-MYE-sin] (solution or gel) and erythromycin [er-ITH-roe-MYE-sin]\n(cream, gel, or lotion). The most common oral antibiotics used for acne are the tetracyclines, doxycycline [DOX-i-\nSYE-kleen] and minocycline [mi-no-SYE-kleen], and the macrolides, erythromycin and azithromycin [a-ZITH-roe-\nMYE-sin]. Topical forms tend to be well tolerated. For oral tetracyclines, common adverse effects are\ngastrointestinal disturbances and photosensitivity, and for the macrolides, gastrointestinal disturbances are common.\nThe most significant concern in the use of both topical and oral antibiotics is the development of bacterial resistance.\nSome measures that can be taken to limit the development of resistance include using antibiotics only in\ncombination with other acne agents, using oral antibiotics for the shortest time possible, and using low-dose oral\nantibiotics (subantimicrobial dosing) when possible. Also, once acne lesions are clear, patients should follow with\ntopical maintenance therapy with effective nonantibiotic topical agents, such as benzoyl peroxide and the retinoids.\nAntibiotics are covered in more detail in the chapters on anti-infective therapy (see",

Azelaic acid\nAzelaic [aze-eh-LAY-ik] acid is a naturally occurring dicarboxylic acid that has antibacterial activity against P.\nacnes  through its ability to inhibit protein synthesis. It also exhibits anti-inflammatory activity, inhibits the division\nand differentiation of keratinocytes, and shows comedolytic activity. Azelaic acid exhibits a lightening effect on\nhyperpigmented skin, which makes it useful in patients who experience dyspigmentation as a consequence of\ninflammatory acne. It is available as a cream and a gel, and the major adverse effects are mild and transient pruritus,\nburning, stinging and tingling.\n1620\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1621 ---\n\nC.  Benzoyl peroxide\nBenzoyl peroxide [BEN-zoyl per-OX-ide] is a commonly used topical medication that improves acne primarily\nthrough its bactericidal action, where its oxidizing activity is lethal for P. acnes . It shows no bacterial resistance. The\nagent also reduces inflammation and has comedolytic activity. It is available in topical washes, foams, creams, and\ngels. The major adverse effects are dry skin, irritation, and bleaching of bedding and clothing. It may also cause\ncontact dermatitis in some patients.\n1621\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1622 ---\n\nD.  Dapsone\nDapsone [DAP-sone] is a sulfone that exhibits both anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activity and is effective at\nreducing inflammatory acne lesion counts, with some reduction in noninflammatory lesions as well. The anti-\ninflammatory activity derives partly from its ability to interfere with neutrophilic function and to reduce the\nproduction of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) by mononuclear cells. Dapsone is available as a topical gel with the\nmost common adverse effects being transient oiliness, dryness, and erythema, which may be at least in part due to\nthe nondrug part of the formulation.\n1622\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1623 ---\n\nE.  Retinoids\nRetinoids are vitamin A derivatives that interact with retinoid receptors to regulate gene expression in a manner that\nnormalizes keratinocyte differentiation and reduces hyperproliferation (giving them comedolytic activity). They also\nreduce sebum production and inflammation. These diverse effects make retinoids useful for acne, as well as a\nvariety of other conditions, including psoriasis and severe rosacea. For acne vulgaris, the topical retinoids tretinoin\n[TRET-i-no-in], adapalene [a-DAP-a-leen], and tazarotene [ta-ZAR-oh-teen] are used for mild and moderate forms,\nwhereas the oral retinoid isotretinoin [eye-so-TRET-i-no-in] is reserved for severe nodular forms of acne.\nAdverse effects of the topical retinoids include erythema, desquamation, burning, and stinging. These effects\noften decrease with time. Other potential adverse effects include dry mucous membranes and photosensitivity.\nPatients should be cautioned to wear sunscreen. Though their systemic absorption is generally limited, use should be\navoided during pregnancy, particularly topical tazarotene, which is the most teratogenic of the three topical retinoids\nfor acne. Oral isotretinoin, used in severe acne, has potentially serious adverse effects including psychiatric effects\nand birth defects. It is contraindicated in women who are pregnant or intend to become pregnant.\n1623\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1624 ---\n\nF.  Salicylic acid\nTopical salicylic [sal-i-SIL-ik] acid, a β-hydroxy acid, penetrates the pilosebaceous unit and works as an exfoliant to\nclear comedones. Its comedolytic effects are not as pronounced as those of the retinoids. The drug has mild anti-\ninflammatory activity and is keratolytic at higher concentrations. Salicylic acid is used as a treatment for mild acne\nand is available in many over-the-counter facial washes and medicated treatment pads. Mild skin peeling, dryness,\nand local irritation are adverse effects.\n1624\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1625 ---\n\nG.  Sulfacetamide sodium\nSulfacetamide sodium [SUL-fa-SET-a-mide SOE-dee-um] interferes with bacterial growth and is often combined\nwith sulfur, a keratolytic agent. The combination is used to treat inflammatory acne lesions when present. It is also\nused to treat rosacea (see below). The product is available as cleanser, cream, foam, gel, lotion, pads, suspension,\nand a wash. The most common adverse effects include contact dermatitis, erythema, pruritus, Stevens-Johnson\nsyndrome, and xeroderma.\n1625\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1626 ---\n\nIV.  Agents for Superficial Bacterial Infections\nSeveral gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria can cause various superficial skin infections, such as folliculitis\nand impetigo, as well as deeper infections, such as erysipelas and cellulitis. In more severe cases, these infections\ncan lead to ulceration and systemic infections. This section covers topical antibacterial agents that can be used for\nthe treatment and prevention of certain superficial skin infections.\n1626\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1627 ---\n\nA.  Bacitracin\nBacitracin [bas-i-TRAY-sin] is a peptide antibiotic active against many gram-positive organisms. It is used mainly\nin topical formulations; if used systemically, it is toxic. Bacitracin is mostly used for the prevention of skin\ninfections after burns or minor scrapes. It is frequently found in combination products with neomycin and/or\npolymyxin (see below).

It\nis available as a cream and an ointment. [Note: Intranasal mupirocin may be used to eradicate colonization with\nmethicillin-resistant S . aureus  and reduce the risk of infection in hospitalized patients.] The most common adverse\neffects are pruritus, skin rash, and burning.\nFigure 43.4 Impetigo on the face.\n1629\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1630 ---\n\nD.  Neomycin\nNeomycin [nee-oh-MY-sin] interferes with bacterial protein synthesis and is active primarily against gram-negative\norganisms, with some activity against gram-positive organisms. This agent is often formulated with other topical\nanti-infectives, such as bacitracin and polymyxin to treat skin infections. The combination is available as an\nointment. Common adverse effects associated with the combination agents include contact dermatitis, erythema,\nrash, and urticaria.\n1630\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1631 ---\n\nE.  Polymyxin\nPolymyxin [paw-lee-MIX-in] B is a cyclic hydrophobic peptide that disrupts the bacterial cell membrane of gram-\nnegative organisms. As noted above, it is commonly combined with bacitracin (“double antibiotic”) and neomycin\nwith bacitracin (“triple antibiotic”) in topical products used for the prevention of skin infections after minor skin\ntrauma. These combinations are available as ointments.\n1631\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1632 ---\n\nF.  Retapamulin\nRetapamulin [RE-te-PAM-ue-lin] is a protein synthesis inhibitor active against gram-positive organisms. It is\nindicated for the treatment of impetigo. The only available dosage form is an ointment, and the most common\nadverse effects are pruritus and skin irritation.\n1632\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1633 ---\n\nV.  Agents Used for Rosacea\nRosacea is a common inflammatory disorder affecting the central portion of facial skin. Common clinical features\ninclude facial erythema (flushing) and inflammatory lesions that are similar to acne lesions. The signs, symptoms,\nand severity determine the treatment for this disorder. Azelaic acid is one potential treatment for rosacea. Other\ntopical and oral products for rosacea are described below.\n1633\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1634 ---\n\nA.  Brimonidine\nBrimonidine [bri-MOE-ni-deen] is an alpha2 adrenoceptor agonist that reduces erythema through vasoconstriction. It\nis available as a gel and its major adverse effects are burning, localized warm feeling, and flushing. [Note:\nBrimonidine ophthalmic solution is used for the treatment of glaucoma.]\n1634\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1635 ---\n\nB.  Doxycycline\nDoxycycline [DOX-i-SYE-kleen] is an antibacterial agent used orally at low doses, where it exerts its effects on\nrosacea, not by killing bacteria, but rather through its anti-inflammatory effects. It is available as a capsule and\ntablet, and its major adverse effects include diarrhea, nausea, dyspepsia, and nasopharyngitis.\n1635\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1636 ---\n\nC.  Metronidazole\nMetronidazole [me-troe-NI-da-zole] is an antibacterial agent used topically for rosacea. It is believed to work in\nrosacea through anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive effects, rather than through its antibacterial effects. It is\navailable as a cream, gel, and lotion, and its major adverse effects are burning, erythema, skin irritation, xeroderma,\nand acne vulgaris.\n1636\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1637 ---\n\nD.  Oxymetazoline\nOxymetazoline [ox-e-meh-TAZ-oh-leen] is an α1 adrenoceptor agonist that reduces erythema through\nvasoconstriction.

Pimecrolimus\nPimecrolimus [pim-e-KROE-li-mus] is a topical calcineurin inhibitor/immunosuppressant agent that decreases\ninflammation. It is available as a cream, and its major adverse effects are burning, irritation, pruritus, and erythema.\n1638\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1639 ---\n\nVI.  Agents for Pigmentation Disorders\nThe color of skin is derived from melanin produced by melanocytes in the basal layer of the epidermis. When the\nmelanocytes are damaged, the melanin levels are affected, which ultimately leads to pigmentation disorders. If the\nbody does not make enough melanin, the skin gets lighter (hypopigmentation). If the body makes too much melanin,\nthe skin gets darker (hyperpigmentation). Pigmentation disorders can be widespread and affect many areas of the\nskin or they can be localized. Agents used for pigmentation disorders are discussed below and summarized in Figure\n43.5.\nFigure 43.5 Summary of drugs for pigmentation disorders, psoriasis, and alopecia.\n1639\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1640 ---\n\n1640\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1641 ---\n\nA.  Hydroquinone\nHydroquinone [HYE-droe-KWIN-one] is a topical skin-whitening agent that reduces hyperpigmentation associated\nwith freckles and melasma (brown to gray-brown patches on the skin; Figure 43.6). It is often used in combination\nwith topical retinoids to treat the signs of photoaging. The mechanism of action of hydroquinone is through\ninhibition of the tyrosinase, an enzyme required for melanin synthesis. Hydroquinone lightens the skin temporarily\nand is commonly used as a 4% preparation. It should not be used in higher concentrations, or in excessive quantities\nfor an extended duration, as it is associated with possible carcinogenicity. The most common adverse effect is local\nskin irritation.\nFigure 43.6 Melasma on the face.\n1641\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1642 ---\n\nB.  Methoxsalen\nMethoxsalen [meth-OX-a-len] is a psoralen photoactive agent that stimulates melanocytes and is used as a\nrepigmentation agent for patients with vitiligo (Figure 43.7). It must be photoactivated by UV radiation to form a\nDNA adduct inhibiting DNA replication by a method called PUVA (psoralen plus UVA radiation). Methoxsalen\ninhibits cell proliferation and promotes cell differentiation of epithelial cells. Topical methoxsalen may be used for\nsmall patches of vitiligo, and oral therapy is used for more widespread disease. Because of the possibilities for aging\nof the skin and carcinogenicity, it is used with caution.\nFigure 43.7 The palm is frequently affected by vitiligo.\n1642\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1643 ---\n\nC.  Tazarotene\nTazarotene is a topical retinoid, which decreases hyperpigmentation, and is sometimes used to treat the signs of\nphotoaging. It is available as a cream, foam, and gel. The most common adverse effects include itching, burning,\nerythema, rash, and dryness.\n1643\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1644 ---\n\nVII.  Agents for Psoriasis\nPsoriasis is a chronic autoimmune skin disease that manifests as epidermal hyperplasia and dermal inflammation,\nwhich can range from mild to disabling. It is a condition that has significant genetic associations and it tends to wax\nand wane, with flare-ups that can be triggered by a number of environmental factors including stress and skin\ntrauma. There are several forms of psoriasis, with the most common form being plaque psoriasis. Plaque psoriasis is\ncharacterized by the presence of sharply demarcated, thick, erythematous plaques that are usually covered by dry\nsilvery-white scales (Figure 43.8). The plaques range in size from 1 square centimeter to several square centimeters.\nIn mild-to-moderate cases, these plaques cover less than 5% of the body surface area, but in more severe cases, they\ncan cover more than 20% of the body. Therapies may target inflammation and the abnormal immune response, as\nwell as epidermal hyperproliferation.\nFigure 43.8 Psoriasis. A large, scaly, erythematous plaque.\n1644\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1645 ---\n\nA.  Apremilast\nApremilast  [a-PRE-mi-last] is an oral agent approved for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. It works by inhibiting\nphosphodiesterase-4, which ultimately leads to reduced production of several inflammatory mediators in psoriasis.\nThe most common adverse effects are diarrhea, nausea, and headache. Depression may also occur. Strong CYP450\ninducers (for example, carbamazepine, phenytoin) may reduce the efficacy of apremilast , and coadministration is\nnot recommended.\n1645\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1646 ---\n\nB.  Biologic agents\nBiologics are agents isolated from natural sources, including humans, animals, and microorganisms. They can be\ncomposed of sugars, proteins, or nucleic acids or complex combinations of these substances. The biologics approved\nfor psoriasis are all injectable, antibody-based proteins produced by recombinant DNA technology. They are used\nfor moderate-to-severe psoriasis and their mechanism of action results from their interaction with specific cytokines\nthat induce or mediate T-cell effector function, which is important in autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis. For\nexample, several biologics target TNF-α, which plays multiple roles in psoriasis pathogenesis, including the\nstimulation of keratinocyte proliferation, neutrophils, and the release of proinflammatory cytokines. The TNF-α\nblockers include etanercept  [ee-TAN-er-sept], infliximab [in-FLIKS-e-mab], adalimumab [a-da-LIM-yoo-mab],\ncertolizumab pegol  [ser-toe-LIZ-oo-mab PEG-ol], and golimumab [goe-LIM-ue-mab]. Biologics that target other\ncytokines important in psoriasis pathogenesis include the anti-IL-12/IL-23 medication, ustekinumab [YOO-sti-KIN-\nue-mab]; the anti-IL-23 medication, guselkumab [gue-sel-KOO-mab]; and the anti-IL-17A medications,\nsecukinumab [SEK-ue-KIN-ue-mab], ixekizumab [IX-ee-KIZ-ue-mab], and brodalumab [broe-DAL-ue-mab].\nThough each agent has specific potential risks and adverse effects, among the adverse effects that they share include\ninjection or infusion reactions and increased risk of infections due to their suppression of the immune system. In\naddition, because they are foreign proteins, there is a risk for the development of antidrug antibodies, which may\naffect efficacy over the course of therapy.\n1646\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1647 ---\n\nC.  Keratolytic agents\nKeratolytic agents such as coal tar and salicylic acid are effective in localized psoriasis, especially on the scalp.\nThey improve corticosteroid penetration. Coal tar inhibits excessive skin cell proliferation and may also have anti-\ninflammatory effects. Because it is cosmetically unappealing, coal tar may have a low acceptance rate among\npatients and, consequently, its use has been largely supplanted by the newer topical agents.\n1647\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1648 ---\n\nD.  Methotrexate\nMethotrexate [meth-oh-TREX-ate] is the most commonly used systemic therapy for psoriasis. The drug is used in\nmore severe forms of psoriasis and the primary mechanism of action is due to immunosuppressive activity, resulting\nfrom its ability to reduce DNA synthesis in cells of the immune system, particularly T lymphocytes. Methotrexate is\navailable in oral and injectable dosage forms. Among the common potential adverse effects are nausea, diarrhea,\nmouth ulcers, hair loss, and skin rashes. The primary long-term risk is the potential for liver damage, and therefore,\nperiodic liver function tests are required for patients using methotrexate.\n1648\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1649 ---\n\nE.  Retinoids\nRetinoids normalize keratinocyte differentiation and reduce hyperproliferation and inflammation. Tazarotene is a\ntopical retinoid used for the treatment of plaque psoriasis. Adverse effects are similar to other topical retinoids\ndescribed for acne. Acitretin [a-si-TRE-tin] is a second-generation retinoid used orally in the treatment of pustular\nforms of psoriasis. Similar to oral isotretinoin used in acne, acitretin is teratogenic and women must avoid\npregnancy for at least 3 years after the use of this drug (due to its long duration of teratogenic potential). Ethanol is\ncontraindicated with this agent. Cheilitis, pruritus, peeling skin, and hyperlipidemia are common adverse effects.\n1649\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1650 ---\n\nF.  Topical corticosteroids\nTopical corticosteroids have been a mainstay of psoriasis therapy for over 50 years, and are used in many other skin\nconditions as well. The available agents differ in potencies and are formulated in a variety of dosage forms,\nincluding solutions, lotions, creams, ointments, gels, and shampoo (Figure 43.9). Upon binding to intracellular\ncorticosteroid receptors, these agents produce numerous effects that can be beneficial for psoriasis, including anti-\ninflammatory, antiproliferative, immunosuppressive, and vasoconstrictive effects. Potential adverse effects,\nespecially with the long-term use of potent corticosteroids, include skin atrophy, striae, acneiform eruptions,\ndermatitis, local infections, and hypopigmentation. In children, excessive use of potent agents applied to a large\nsurface area can cause systemic toxicity, including possible depression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis\nand growth retardation.\nFigure 43.9 Potency of various topical corticosteroids. c = cream; g = gel; o = ointment;\ns = solution.\n1650\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1651 ---\n\nG.  Vitamin D analogues\nCalcipotriene [kal-sih-poh-TRY-een] and calcitriol  [kal-si-TRYE-ol] are synthetic vitamin D3 derivatives used\ntopically to treat plaque psoriasis. They inhibit keratinocyte proliferation, enhance keratinocyte differentiation, and\ninhibit inflammation. Calcipotriene is available in cream, ointment, solution, and foam formulations, and calcitriol\nis available as an ointment. Potential adverse effects include itching, dryness, burning, irritation, and erythema.\n1651\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1652 ---\n\nVIII.  Agents for Alopecia\nAlopecia (baldness) is the partial or complete loss of hair from areas where hair normally grows. The most common\ntype of hair loss is androgenic alopecia (also known as male pattern baldness), which can occur in men or women.\nTrichogenic agents are used to stimulate hair growth and slow the progression of hair loss.\n1652\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1653 ---\n\nA.  Finasteride\nFinasteride [fih-NAH-steh-ride] is an oral 5-α reductase inhibitor that blocks conversion of testosterone to the potent\nandrogen 5-α dihydrotestosterone (DHT). High levels of DHT can cause the hair follicle to miniaturize and atrophy.\nFinasteride decreases scalp and serum DHT concentrations, thus inhibiting a key factor in the etiology of\nandrogenic alopecia. [Note: Finasteride is used in higher doses for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (see",

Minoxidil\nMinoxidil  [min-OX-i-dil], originally used as a systemic antihypertensive, was noted to have the adverse effect of\nincreased hair growth. This adverse effect was turned into a therapeutic application in the treatment of alopecia. For\nhair loss, the drug is available as a nonprescription topical foam or solution, without systemic hypotensive effects.\nMinoxidil  is effective at halting hair loss in both men and women and may produce hair growth in some patients.\nAlthough the mechanism of action is not fully known, it is believed to act, at least in part, by shortening the rest\nphase of the hair cycle. The drug must be used continuously to maintain effects on hair growth. The main adverse\neffects include erythema and pruritus.\n1654\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1655 ---\n\n43.1\n43.2\n43.3\n43.4\n43.5\n43.6Study Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nWhich is correct regarding the use of isotretinoin in the treatment of acne?\nA.

Overview\nFor thousands of years, poisons and the study of them (toxicology) have been woven into the rich fabric of the\nhuman experience. Homer and Aristotle described the poison arrow; Socrates was executed with poison hemlock;\nlead poisoning may have helped bring down the Roman Empire; Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, and Michael\nJackson all fatally overdosed on prescription medications. Toxins can be inhaled, insufflated (snorted), orally\ningested, injected, and absorbed dermally (Figure 44.1). An understanding of the varied mechanisms of toxicity\nhelps to develop an approach to treatment. This chapter provides an overview of the emergent management of the\npoisoned patient, as well as a brief review of some of the more common and interesting toxins, their mechanisms,\nclinical presentations, and clinical management.\nFigure 44.1 Routes of exposure for toxins.\n1658\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1659 ---\n\nII.  Emergency Treatment of the Poisoned Patient\nThe first principle in the management of the poisoned patient is to treat the patient, not the poison. Airway,\nbreathing, and circulation are assessed and addressed initially, along with any other immediately life-threatening\ntoxic effect (for example, profound increases or decreases in blood pressure, heart rate, respirations, or body\ntemperature, or any dangerous dysrhythmias). Acid/base and electrolyte disturbances, acetaminophen and salicylate\nblood levels, and results of other appropriate drug screens can be further assessed as laboratory results are obtained.\nAfter administering oxygen, obtaining intravenous access, and placing the patient on a cardiac monitor, the poisoned\npatient with altered mental status should be considered for administration of the “coma cocktail.” The coma cocktail\nconsists of intravenous dextrose to treat hypoglycemia, a possible toxicological cause of altered mental status,\nnaloxone to treat possible opioid or clonidine toxicity, and thiamine for ethanol-induced Wernicke encephalopathy.\n1659\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1660 ---\n\nA.  Decontamination\nOnce the patient is stabilized, decontamination can occur. This may include flushing the eyes with saline or tepid\nwater to a neutral pH for ocular exposures, rinsing the skin for dermal exposures, and/or gastrointestinal (GI)\ndecontamination with gastric lavage, activated charcoal, or whole bowel irrigation (utilizing a polyethylene glycol\nelectrolyte balanced solution) for ingestions. Therapy should be administered preferably within 1 hour of ingestion.\nSeveral substances do not adsorb to activated charcoal (for example, lead and other heavy metals, iron, lithium,\npotassium, and alcohols), limiting the use of activated charcoal unless there are coingested products.\n1660\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1661 ---\n\nB.  Elimination enhancement\n1.  Hemodialysis\nThe elimination of some medications/toxins may be enhanced by hemodialysis if certain properties are met, such as\nlow protein binding, small volume of distribution, small molecular weight, and water solubility of the toxin.\nExamples of medications or substances that can be removed with hemodialysis include methanol, ethylene glycol,\nsalicylates, theophylline, phenobarbital , and lithium.\n2.  Urinary alkalinization\nAlkalinization of the urine enhances the elimination of salicylates or phenobarbital . Increasing the urine pH with\nintravenous sodium bicarbonate transforms the drug into an ionized form that prevents reabsorption, thereby\ntrapping it in the urine to be excreted by the kidney. The goal urine pH is 7.5 to 8, while ensuring the serum pH does\nnot exceed 7.55.\n3.  Multiple-dose activated charcoal\nMultiple-dose activated charcoal enhances the elimination of certain drugs (for example, theophylline,\nphenobarbital , digoxin, carbamazepine). Activated charcoal is extremely porous and has a high surface area, which\ncreates a gradient across the lumen of the gut. Medications traverse from areas of high concentration to low\nconcentration, promoting absorbed medication to cross back into the gut to be adsorbed by the activated charcoal. In\naddition, activated charcoal blocks the reabsorption of medications that undergo enterohepatic recirculation (such as\nphenytoin), by adsorbing the substance to the activated charcoal (Figure 44.2). Bowel sounds must be present prior\nto each activated charcoal dose to prevent obstruction.\n1661\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1662 ---\n\nFigure 44.2 Mechanism of multiple-dose activated charcoal.\n1662\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1663 ---\n\nIII.  Select Pharmaceutical and Occupational Toxicities\n1663\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1664 ---\n\nA.  Acetaminophen\nAcetaminophen produces toxicity when normal metabolic pathways become saturated, leading to the production of a\nhepatotoxic metabolite (N -acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, NAPQI) (Figure 44.3). After therapeutic doses of\nacetaminophen, the liver generates glutathione, which detoxifies NAPQI. However, in overdose, glutathione is\ndepleted, leaving the metabolite to produce toxicity. There are four phases typically describing acetaminophen\ntoxicity (Figure 44.4). The antidote for acetaminophen toxicity, N-acetylcysteine (NAC ), works as a glutathione\nprecursor and glutathione substitute, and assists with sulfation. NAC  may also function as an antioxidant to aid in\nrecovery. NAC  is most effective when initiated within 8 to 10 hours of ingestion. The Rumack-Matthew nomogram\n(Figure 44.5), which is based on the time of ingestion and the serum acetaminophen level, is utilized after an acute\ningestion to determine if NAC  therapy is needed. The nomogram is helpful to predict acetaminophen toxicity when\nlevels can be obtained between 4 and 24 hours postingestion.\n1664\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1665 ---\n\n1665\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1666 ---\n\nFigure 44.3 Metabolism of acetaminophen.\nFigure 44.4 Phases of acetaminophen toxicity.\n1666\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1667 ---\n\nFigure 44.5 Rumack-Matthew nomogram for acetaminophen poisoning.

Clin. North Am.  33: 691 (1986), with\npermission.\n1667\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1668 ---\n\nB.  Alcohols\n1.  Methanol (wood alcohol) and ethylene glycol\nMethanol is found in products like windshield washer fluid and model airplane fuel. Ethylene glycol is most\ncommonly found in radiator antifreeze. These primary alcohols are relatively nontoxic and mainly cause central\nnervous system (CNS) depression. However, methanol and ethylene glycol are oxidized to toxic products: formic\nacid in the case of methanol, and glycolic, glyoxylic, and oxalic acids in the case of ethylene glycol. Fomepizole\n[foe-MEP-i-zole] inhibits this oxidative pathway by blocking alcohol dehydrogenase. [Note: Ethanol is an\nalternative if fomepizole is not available.] It prevents the formation of toxic metabolites and allows the parent\nalcohols to be excreted by the kidney (Figure 44.6). Hemodialysis is often utilized to remove the toxic acids that are\nalready produced. In addition, cofactors are administered to encourage metabolism to nontoxic metabolites ( folate\nfor methanol, thiamine and pyridoxine for ethylene glycol). If untreated, methanol ingestion may produce blindness,\nmetabolic acidosis, seizures, and coma. Ethylene glycol ingestion may lead to renal failure, hypocalcemia, metabolic\nacidosis, and heart failure.\n1668\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1669 ---\n\n1669\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1670 ---\n\nFigure 44.6 Metabolism of methanol and ethylene glycol.\n2.  Isopropanol (rubbing alcohol, isopropyl alcohol)\nThis secondary alcohol is metabolized to acetone via alcohol dehydrogenase. Acetone cannot be further oxidized to\ncarboxylic acids, and therefore, acidemia does not occur. Because isopropyl alcohol is not metabolized to a toxic\nmetabolite, no antidote is necessary to treat an isopropyl alcohol ingestion. Isopropanol is a known CNS depressant\n(approximately twice as intoxicating as ethanol) and GI irritant. Treatment centers on supportive care.\n1670\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1671 ---\n\nC.  Carbon monoxide\nCarbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas. It is a natural by-product of the combustion of\ncarbonaceous materials, and common sources of this gas include automobiles, poorly vented furnaces, fireplaces,\nwood-burning stoves, kerosene space heaters, house fires, charcoal grills, and generators. Following inhalation,\ncarbon monoxide rapidly binds to hemoglobin to produce carboxyhemoglobin. The binding affinity of carbon\nmonoxide to hemoglobin is 230 to 270 times greater than that of oxygen. Consequently, even low concentrations of\ncarbon monoxide in the air can produce significant levels of carboxyhemoglobin. In addition, bound carbon\nmonoxide increases hemoglobin affinity for oxygen at the other oxygen-binding sites. This high-affinity binding of\noxygen prevents the unloading of oxygen at the tissues, further reducing oxygen delivery ( Figure 44.7). The\npresence of this highly oxygenated blood may produce “cherry red” skin. Carbon monoxide toxicity can also occur\nfollowing inhalation or ingestion of methylene chloride found in paint strippers. Once absorbed, methylene chloride\nis metabolized to carbon monoxide through the hepatic cytochrome P450 pathway. The symptoms of carbon\nmonoxide intoxication are consistent with hypoxia, including headache, dyspnea, lethargy, confusion, and\ndrowsiness. Higher exposure levels can lead to seizures, coma, and death. The management of a carbon monoxide–\npoisoned patient includes prompt removal from the source of carbon monoxide, and institution of 100% oxygen by\nnonrebreathing face mask or endotracheal tube. In patients with severe intoxication, oxygenation in a hyperbaric\nchamber is recommended.\nFigure 44.7 Effect of carbon monoxide on the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin. CO-Hb =\ncarbon monoxyhemoglobin.\n1671\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1672 ---\n\nD.  Cyanide\nCyanide is one of the toxic products of combustion produced during house fires. Its principal toxicity occurs as a\nresult of the inactivation of the enzyme cytochrome oxidase (cytochrome a3), leading to the inhibition of cellular\nrespiration. Therefore, even in the presence of oxygen, tissues with a high oxygen demand such as the brain and\nheart are adversely affected. Death can occur quickly due to arrest of oxidative phosphorylation and production of\nadenosine triphosphate. The antidote, hydroxocobalamin (vitamin B12a), is administered intravenously to bind the\ncyanide and produce cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12) without the adverse effects of hypotension or methemoglobin\nproduction seen with older antidotes. The older cyanide antidote kit consists of sodium nitrite to form\ncyanomethemoglobin and sodium thiosulfate to accelerate the production of thiocyanate, which is much less toxic\nthan cyanide and is quickly excreted in urine. To avoid the oxygen carrying capacity becoming too low in patients\nwith smoke inhalation and cyanide toxicity, the induction of methemoglobin with sodium nitrite should be avoided\nunless the carboxyhemoglobin concentration is less than 10%.\n1672\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1673 ---\n\nE.  Iron\nThe incidence of pediatric iron toxicity has greatly diminished during the past two decades due to education and\nchanges in packaging and labeling of iron products. Iron is radiopaque and may show up on an abdominal\nradiograph if the product contains a sufficient concentration of elemental iron. Toxic effects can be expected with\ningestions as little as 20 mg/kg of elemental iron, and doses of 60 mg/kg may be lethal. Each iron salt contains a\ndifferent concentration of elemental iron (Figure 44.8). A serum iron level should be obtained, since levels between\n500 and 1000 μg/dL have been associated with shock and levels higher than 1000 μg/dL with death. Patients with\niron toxicity usually present with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Depending on the amount of elemental iron\ningested, the patient may experience a latent period or may progress quickly to hypovolemia, metabolic acidosis,\nhypotension, and coagulopathy. Ultimately, hepatic failure and multisystem failure, coma, and death may occur.\nDeferoxamine [de-fer-OKS-a-meen], an iron-specific chelator, binds free iron, creating ferrioxamine, which is\nexcreted in the urine. Hypotension may occur if rapid intravenous boluses of deferoxamine are administered instead\nof a continuous infusion.\nFigure 44.8 Elemental iron contained in various iron preparations.\n1673\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1674 ---\n\nF.  Lead\nLead is ubiquitous in the environment, with sources of exposure including old paint, drinking water, industrial\npollution, food, and contaminated dust. Most chronic exposure to lead occurs with inorganic lead salts, such as those\nin paint used in housing constructed prior to 1978. Adults absorb about 10% of ingested lead, whereas children\nabsorb about 40%. Inorganic forms of lead are initially distributed to the soft tissues and more slowly redistribute to\nbone, teeth, and hair. Lead impairs bone formation and causes increased calcium deposition in long bones visible on\nx-ray. Ingested lead is radiopaque and may appear on an abdominal radiograph if present in the GI tract. Lead has an\napparent blood half-life of about 1 to 2 months, whereas its half-life in the bone is 20 to 30 years. Chronic exposure\nto lead can have serious effects on several tissues (Figure 44.9). Early symptoms of lead toxicity can include\ndiscomfort and constipation (and, occasionally, diarrhea), whereas higher exposures can produce painful intestinal\nspasms. CNS effects from lead include headaches, confusion, clumsiness, insomnia, fatigue, and impaired\nconcentration. As the disease progresses, clonic convulsions and coma can occur. Death is rare, given the ability to\ntreat lead intoxication with chelation therapy. Blood levels of 5 to 20 μg/dL in children have been shown to lower IQ\nin the absence of other symptoms. Finally, lead can cause hypochromic, microcytic anemia as a result of a shortened\nerythrocyte life span and disruption of heme synthesis.\nFigure 44.9 Comparison of effects of lead on children and adults. From the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention. http://wonder.cdc.gov/.\nMultiple chelators can be utilized in the treatment of lead toxicity. When levels are greater than 45 μg/dL, but less\nthan 70 μg/dL in children, succimer (dimercaptosuccinic acid [DMSA]), an oral chelator, is the treatment of choice.\nWith lead levels greater than 70 μg/dL or if encephalopathy is present, dual parenteral therapy is required with\ndimercaprol  given intramuscularly and calcium disodium edetate given intravenously. Dimercaprol  is suspended in\npeanut oil and should not be given to those with a peanut allergy.\n1674\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1675 ---\n\n1675\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1676 ---\n\nG.  Organophosphate and carbamate insecticides\nThese insecticides exert their toxicity through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, with subsequent accumulation of\nexcess acetylcholine producing nicotinic (mydriasis, fasciculations, muscle weakness, tachycardia, hypertension)\nand muscarinic (diarrhea, urination, miosis, bradycardia, bronchorrhea, emesis, lacrimation, salivation) effects.\nCarbamates reversibly bind to acetylcholinesterase, whereas organophosphates undergo an aging process to\nultimately irreversibly inactivate the enzyme. Organophosphate nerve agents, such as sarin, soman, and tabun, have\nthe same mechanism of action, but the aging process is much more rapid compared to insecticides. Atropine, a\nmuscarinic receptor antagonist, and pralidoxime, an oxime to reactivate cholinesterase, should be administered\nintravenously or intramuscularly to treat the muscarinic and nicotinic effects, respectively (see",

This is not an all-inclusive list.\n1677\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1678 ---\n\n1678\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1679 ---\n\nFigure 44.10 Common antidotes.\n1679\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1680 ---\n\n44.1\n44.2\n44.3\n44.4Study Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nA 3-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother, who reports that he has been crying\ncontinuously and “does not want to play or eat” for the past few days. She also states that he has not had\nregular bowel movements, with mostly constipation and occasional diarrhea, and frequently complains of\nabdominal pain. The child now has an altered level of consciousness, is difficult to arouse, and begins to\nseize. The clinician rules out infection and other medical causes. Upon questioning, the mother states that the\nhouse is in an older neighborhood, that her house has not been remodeled or repainted since the 1940s, and\nthat the paint is chipping around the windows and doors. The child is otherwise breathing on his own and\nurinating normally. Which toxin would you expect to be producing such severe effects in this child?\nA.  Iron\nB.  Lead\nC.  Carbon monoxide\nD.  Cyanide\nCorrect answer = B. Lead poisoning is common among children in older homes painted before lead was removed\nfrom paint. Paint chips with lead are easily ingested by toddlers, and excessively high lead levels can lead to the\nsigns and symptoms described plus clumsiness, confusion, headaches, coma, constipation, intestinal spasms, and\nanemia. Death is rare when chelation therapy is instituted. Iron can produce abdominal pain, but more often\nwould cause diarrhea, vomiting, and volume loss. Carbon monoxide would affect the entire household, depending\non the source. Clinical effects from carbon monoxide would include headache, nausea, and CNS depression. If he\nhad cyanide poisoning, death would have occurred quickly following respiratory arrest of oxidative\nphosphorylation and production of adenosine triphosphate, but this child has been exhibiting symptoms over\nseveral days.\nA 41-year-old male jeweler presents to the emergency department after he was found unconscious on the\nfloor of the shop by a coworker. The coworker states that the patient complained of being cold this morning\naround 8 AM (the central heat was broken, and the outdoor temperature was 34°F) and that since noon, he had\nbeen complaining of headache, drowsiness, confusion, and nausea. The clinician notices that he has cherry\nred skin. What is the most likely toxin causing his signs and symptoms?\nA.  Ethylene glycol\nB.  Cyanide\nC.  Acetaminophen\nD.  Carbon monoxide\nCorrect answer = D. Although watch makers and other professionals who use electroplating may be at higher risk\nfor cyanide exposure because many plating baths use cyanide-containing ingredients (for example, potassium\ncyanide), this patient shows signs of carbon monoxide poisoning, such as cherry red skin, headache, confusion,\nnausea, and drowsiness leading to unconsciousness. The history also leads us to believe that this person may have\nbeen using a space heater to stay warm, which would be consistent with the description. A carboxyhemoglobin\nlevel should be obtained to confirm the exposure. Cyanide in low doses from such an occupational exposure can\npresent with loss of consciousness, flushing, headache, and confusion. Chronically, workers may develop a rash\nafter handling cyanide solutions. Also, an odor of bitter almonds may be present. An arterial blood gas and a\nvenous blood gas could be obtained and compared to determine if cyanide is present (a lack of oxygen extraction\nwould be present on the venous side). Ethylene glycol toxicity may cause alterations in mental status, but the\nhistory did not include anything suggesting a toxic alcohol ingestion. Acetaminophen toxicity is not consistent\nwith this presentation.\nA 50-year-old migrant field worker comes to the emergency department and complains of diarrhea, tearing,\nnausea and vomiting, and sweating. The clinician notices that he looks generally anxious and has fine\nfasciculations in the muscles of the upper chest as well as pinpoint pupils. Which antidote should he receive\nfirst?\nA.  N -acetylcysteine\nB.  Sodium nitrite\nC.  Deferoxamine\nD.  Atropine\nCorrect answer = D. Atropine is appropriate for this patient, who has symptoms consistent with organophosphate\n(insecticide) poisoning. The mnemonic DUMBBELS (diarrhea, urination, miosis, bronchorrhea/bradycardia,\nemesis, lacrimation, salivation) can be used to remember the signs and symptoms of cholinergic toxicity. An\nanticholinergic antidote, atropine, controls these muscarinic symptoms, whereas the antidote pralidoxime treats\nthe nicotinic symptoms like fasciculations (involuntary muscle quivering or twitching). N-acetylcysteine is the\nantidote for acetaminophen overdose and acts as a sulfhydryl donor. Sodium nitrite is one of the antidotes\nincluded in the old cyanide antidote kit (sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate). Deferoxamine is the chelating\nagent for iron.\nA 45-year-old man presented to the emergency department 18 hours after ingesting an unknown product. On\npresentation, he is tachycardic, hypertensive, tachypneic, and complaining of flank pain. A metabolic panel1680\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1681 ---\n\n44.5\n44.6\n44.7\n44.8is obtained, and the patient has a large anion gap acidosis, an increased creatinine, and hypocalcemia. Which\nsubstance was most likely ingested?\nA.  Methanol\nB.  Acetaminophen\nC.  Ethylene glycol\nD.  Iron\nCorrect answer = C. Ethylene glycol produces a metabolic acidosis from the toxic metabolites. The formation of\ncalcium oxalate crystals, which can be found on urinalysis, leads to hypocalcemia and renal failure. The treatment\nregimen for this patient would include intravenous fomepizole, if some of the parent compound was still present,\nand hemodialysis. Methanol may produce a metabolic acidosis as well, but its target organ of toxicity is the eyes\ninstead of the kidneys as with ethylene glycol. Acetaminophen toxicity may produce upper quadrant pain within\nthe first 24 hours, but vital sign abnormalities are not usually found during this time frame. Iron toxicity may also\nproduce a metabolic acidosis and tachycardia. However, hypocalcemia does not occur.\nA 27-year-old woman presents to the emergency department 6 hours after reportedly ingesting 20 tablets of\nacetaminophen 500 mg. An acetaminophen level is drawn, but it has to be sent out to another lab and will not\nreturn for another 6 hours. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient?\nA.  Administer a dose of activated charcoal.\nB.  Start empirical N -acetylcysteine therapy.\nC.  Wait for the level to return and then decide what to do.\nD.  Draw a NAPQI level.\nCorrect answer = B. N-acetylcysteine should be started empirically on the basis of the history, and then, once the\nlevel returns and is plotted on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram, a final decision on whether to continue therapy\ncan be made. Activated charcoal would not be of any benefit 6 hours post-acetaminophen ingestion. The optimal\ntime frame to give N-acetylcysteine is within 8 to 10 hours postingestion. So, waiting on the level to return would\nput the patient more than 12 hours postingestion. Therefore, initiation of N-acetylcysteine therapy should happen,\nif possible during the optimal time frame. Clinicians are unable to draw a NAPQI level and therefore cannot\nutilize this to guide therapy.\nA 15-year-old girl presents to the emergency department with CNS depression. She is slightly bradycardic\nand slightly hypotensive. Upon further questioning, the mother admits that the patient was found with an\nopen bottle of clonidine. Which antidote might be beneficial for this patient?\nA.  Flumazenil\nB.  Atropine\nC.  Deferoxamine\nD.  Naloxone\nCorrect answer = D. Naloxone has a reversal rate of the CNS effects of approximately 50% in clonidine\ningestions. Flumazenil reverses benzodiazepines and has no effect on clonidine. Atropine is an anticholinergic\nagent and would not improve the CNS depression. Deferoxamine is the chelator for iron.\nA 45-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a complaint of persistent vomiting. The\npatient appears intoxicated, but an ethanol level returns as negative and her basic metabolic panel is\nunremarkable. Which substance did she probably ingest?\nA.  Isopropyl alcohol\nB.  Methanol\nC.  Ethylene glycol\nD.  Ethanol\nCorrect answer = A. Isopropyl alcohol produces twice as much CNS depression as ethanol and is known to cause\nGI distress. Isopropyl alcohol is metabolized to acetone, so a metabolic acidosis does not result (which is in\ncontrast to the acidosis generated by methanol and ethylene glycol). The ethanol level was negative, eliminating\nethanol as an ingestion.\nA 5-year-old boy is brought in to the healthcare facility for being irritable and failure to thrive. He is drowsy,\nand his vital signs are normal. The doctor diagnoses him with lead toxicity when the blood lead level returns\nas 75 μg/dL. Which chelator regimen should be started?\nA.  Dimercaprol\nB.  Calcium disodium edetate\nC.  Both dimercaprol and calcium disodium edetate\nD.  Succimer\nCorrect answer = C. Dual parenteral therapy with dimercaprol and calcium disodium edetate is indicated if\nencephalopathy is present, or if the lead level is greater than 70 μg/dL in a child. Dimercaprol intramuscular\ntherapy is initiated 4 hours prior to the intravenous administration of calcium disodium edetate when both\nmedications are required. Succimer (dimercaptosuccinic acid, DMSA) is utilized when the lead level is greater\nthan 45 μg/dL but less than 70 μg/dL, without encephalopathy.1681\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1682 ---\n\n44.9\n44.10A healthy 2-year-old boy ingested one of his mother’s 2 mg clonazepam tablets 1 hour ago. The child\npresented to the emergency department with CNS depression but a normal heart rate and blood pressure. His\nbedside glucose check is also normal. Which antidote might be helpful?\nA.  Flumazenil\nB.  Naloxone\nC.  Physostigmine\nD.  Fomepizole\nCorrect answer = A. Flumazenil is a competitive benzodiazepine antagonist that reverses the CNS depression\nfrom benzodiazepines such as clonazepam. After flumazenil administration, resedation usually occurs, since the\nduration of the benzodiazepine is longer than that of the flumazenil. Naloxone reverses the effects from opioids\nand clonidine, not benzodiazepines. Physostigmine is the antidote for anticholinergic toxicity. Fomepizole is the\nantidote for methanol or ethylene glycol toxicity.\nA 47-year-old man with a history of a seizure disorder, maintained on phenytoin, presented to the emergency\ndepartment with salicylate toxicity. The salicylate level was 50 mg/dL (15 to 35 mg/dL therapeutic range)\nand the phenytoin level was 15 mg/L (10 to 20 mg/L therapeutic range). What therapy can be considered to\nenhance the elimination of salicylate without impacting the phenytoin?\nA.  Multiple doses of activated charcoal\nB.  Urinary alkalinization\nC.  Whole bowel irrigation\nD.  Urinary acidification\nCorrect answer = B. Urinary alkalinization enhances the elimination of the salicylate but does not affect the\ntherapeutic phenytoin level. Multiple doses of activated charcoal would lower the concentration of both\nmedications, rendering the phenytoin subtherapeutic. Whole bowel irrigation is another GI decontamination\nmodality involving administration of large quantities (up to 2 L/h in adults) of a polyethylene glycol–balanced\nelectrolyte solution via a nasogastric tube until the patient generates clear rectal effluent.\n1682\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1683 ---\n\nIndex\nA\nAbacavir (ABC)\nAbacavir + lamivudine\nAbacavir + zidovudine + lamivudine\nAbacavir + lamivudine + dolutegravir\nAbaloparatide\nAbatacept\nAbciximab\nadverse effects of\nmechanism of action\npharmacokinetics of\ntherapeutic uses of\nABILIFY.

Overview\nA boy inhales paint fumes to momentarily escape his surroundings of poverty; a new gang member smokes crack\nwith his friends to feel like he belongs; a curious girl swallows a “Molly” to see what it is like; a prescription drug\nabuser injects fentanyl -laced heroin to substitute for the pain pills that are more difficult to obtain; and a lonely\nwidower drinks another shot of bourbon to help remember the past and forget the present. In each of these cases,\nchemicals are being used for nontherapeutic effects on the body or mind. Excessive use or misuse of drugs or\nethanol  (commonly known as alcohol) for intoxicating or mind-altering effects is considered substance misuse, and\nthose who misuse substances are considered to have a substance use disorder. Figure 45.1 provides a list of\ncommonly abused substances.\nFigure 45.1 Summary of commonly abused substances.\nSubstance use disorders occur in many forms and their effects have been witnessed throughout the history of the\nworld. The lure of addictive substances continues to impact people today. In 2015, approximately 10.1% of the\npopulation in the United States were current users of some form of illicit substance (Figure 45.2), while 6.2% were\nconsidered to have an alcohol use disorder, and 4.7% misused prescription medications. Abused substances have\nbecome progressively more potent, and their routes of administration have become increasingly effective, resulting\nin greater risks of addiction (Figure 45.3) and toxicity. Some examples of the methods, mechanisms, and clinical\nmanifestations of toxicity of commonly abused substances are discussed in this chapter.\n1760\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1761 ---\n\nFigure 45.2 Past-month illicit drug use among persons aged 12 or older. Illicit drugs\ninclude marijuana/hashish, cocaine  (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or\nprescription type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically.\n1761\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1762 ---\n\nFigure 45.3 Relative potential for physical dependence of commonly abused substances.\n1762\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1763 ---\n\nII.  Sympathomimetics\nSympathomimetics are stimulants that mimic the sympathetic nervous system, producing “fight-or-flight” responses.\nSympathomimetics usually produce a relative increase of adrenergic neurotransmitters at the site of action (Figure\n45.4), thereby causing effects such as tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, and tachypnea. These agents come\nfrom natural sources, such as plants, or are synthesized in legitimate or clandestine laboratories. Aside from the\nstimulant effect, many of these agents have a remarkable ability to produce pleasure. Consequently, their addictive\npotential and monetary value on the illicit market offer a huge profit motive.\nFigure 45.4 Mechanism of action of cocaine.\n1763\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1764 ---\n\nA.  Cocaine\nCocaine is derived from the coca shrub (Erythroxylum coca ) that grows in the foothills of the Andes Mountains in\nSouth America. It causes central nervous system (CNS) stimulation by inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine into\nthe adrenergic neuron, thus increasing the availability of catecholamines at the synapse. The profound ability of\ncocaine to stimulate the pleasure center of the human brain is thought to result from inhibition of reuptake of\ndopamine and serotonin. Cocaine has minimal bioavailability when taken by the oral route. Instead, the cocaine\nhydrochloride powder is snorted, or solubilized and injected. The cocaine powder cannot be effectively smoked, as\nit is destroyed upon heating. However, crack cocaine, an alkaloidal form, can be smoked. Smoking is an extremely\neffective route of administration, as the lungs are richly perfused with blood and carry the drug within seconds to its\nsite of action, the brain. This causes an intense euphoria or “rush” that is followed rapidly by an intense dysphoria or\n“crash.” It is this immediate positive reinforcement, followed rapidly by the negative reinforcement that makes the\ndrug, particularly in this form, so addictive. Like most drugs of abuse, street cocaine powder and crack are usually\nadulterated to increase the bulk, mimic the action, and thereby increase the profitability.\nThe clinical manifestations of cocaine toxicity are a function of its stimulant effects. Common reasons for\ncocaine users to present to the emergency department include psychiatric complaints (depression precipitated by\ncocaine dysphoria, agitation/paranoia), convulsions, hyperthermia, and chest pain. Hyperthermia is caused by\ncocaine-induced CNS stimulation that increases heat production and vasoconstrictive effects of cocaine that\nminimize the ability to dissipate heat. Cocaine-related chest pain can be chest muscle pain or cardiac in nature, as\ncocaine causes vasoconstriction of coronary arteries and accelerates the atherosclerotic process. Commonly, cocaine\nis consumed with ethanol , which creates a secondary metabolite cocaethylene. The metabolite is cardiotoxic and\nfurther contributes to cardiac issues related to cocaine consumption. Cocaine chest pain can also be related to\npulmonary damage caused by inhalation of this heated impure substance. Cocaine convulsions are a natural\nextension of the CNS stimulant effect (Figure 45.5). Cocaine toxicity is treated by calming and cooling the patient.\nBenzodiazepines, such as lorazepam, help to calm the agitated patient and can both treat and prevent convulsions. In\naddition, the calming effect helps cool the patient and manage hyperthermia. This is an important therapeutic effect,\nas hyperthermia is one of the major causes of cocaine fatalities. The remainder of cocaine toxicity is treated with\nshort-acting antihypertensives, anticonvulsants, and symptomatic supportive care.\n1764\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1765 ---\n\n1765\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1766 ---\n\nFigure 45.5 Major effects of cocaine  use.\n1766\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1767 ---\n\nB.  Amphetamines\nAmphetamines such as methamphetamine are sympathomimetics with clinical effects very similar to those of\ncocaine. Amphetamines act by enhancing the release of biogenic amines from the storage sites in the nerve\nterminals. In many cases, these effects may last longer and are associated with more stimulation and less euphoria\nwhen compared to cocaine. Treatment of amphetamine toxicity is similar to that of cocaine toxicity. Therapeutic\nuses of amphetamines are presented in",

        "content": "Chapter 15.\n1767\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1768 ---\n\nC.  Methylenedioxymethamphetamine\nMethylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA ), commonly known as ecstasy or molly, is a hallucinogenic\namphetamine with profound serotonin-releasing effects (Figure 45.6). However, like most illicit substances, MDMA\nis often substituted or adulterated with other drugs such as methylone. The chemical structure of methylone differs\nfrom MDMA  by one carbonyl group (Figure 45.7), but the drug is more profitable to dealers and does not produce\nthe same euphoric effect. Because of its unique serotonin properties, MDMA  is sometimes referred to as an\n“empathogen,” and tactile stimulation is particularly pleasurable to users. Many users describe a sense of well-being\nand social interactivity, and sexual offenders have also taken advantage of this property of the drug. Like many\namphetamines, MDMA  can cause bruxism (teeth grinding) and trismus (jaw clenching), which explain the baby\npacifiers and lollipops that have been popularized among “ravers.” Among the most disturbing properties of MDMA\nabuse is its propensity to cause profound hyperthermia, altered mental status, and serotonin syndrome.\nBenzodiazepines help to calm and cool the patient, and life-threatening hyperthermia has been treated with\nneuromuscular blockers and endotracheal intubation to control excessive movement and heat generation.\nCyproheptadine is a serotonin antagonist that has been used to treat serotonin syndrome; however, one of its\npractical limitations is that it is only available in an oral formulation.\n1768\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1769 ---\n\n1769\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1770 ---\n\nFigure 45.6 Proposed mechanism of action of methylenedioxymethamphetamine\n(MDMA).\nFigure 45.7 Comparison of the structures of methylenedioxymethamphetamine and\nmethylone.\n1770\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1771 ---\n\nD.  Synthetic cathinones\nCathinone is the psychoactive component in the evergreen shrub Khat (Catha edulis ) native to East Africa and the\nArabian Peninsula. Synthetic cathinones, also known as “bath salts,” have become increasingly popular. These\nproducts are packaged and labeled as “bath salts” or “pond water cleaner” to circumvent detection, prosecution, and\nenforcement. Many of these packages read “not for human consumption,” although they are sold with an unstated\nunderstanding by the seller and buyer that they produce intoxication. Synthetic cathinones are not easily detected in\nurine toxicology screens.\nMethcathinone, butylone, methylenedioxypyrovalerone, and naphyrone are just a few examples of synthetic\ncathinones. These drugs increase the release and inhibit the reuptake of catecholamines (norepinephrine,\nepinephrine, and dopamine) in a manner very similar to cocaine and amphetamines. A rapid onset of amphetamine-\nlike stimulation with psychotomimetic effects of variable duration is common with synthetic cathinones. Bath salts\nare generally snorted or ingested, but they may also be injected. Treatment is similar to the emergent treatment of\namphetamines and cocaine.\n1771\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1772 ---\n\nIII.  Hallucinogens\nLysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), marijuana, and synthetic cannabinoids are substances that fall into this category.\n1772\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1773 ---\n\nA.  Lysergic acid diethylamide\nLSD, lysergic acid diethylamide, is perhaps the most commonly recognized drug in the hallucinogen class. LSD was\nfirst created from ergot in 1938 by Dr. Albert Hoffman. LSD produces its psychedelic effects through serving as a\npotent partial agonist at 5-HT2A receptors. Aside from the very colorful hallucinations, the drug is also responsible\nfor mood alterations, sleep disturbances, and anxiety. Repeated use rapidly produces tolerance through down-\nregulation of serotonin receptors.\nAlthough physical adverse effects are typically minimal, LSD may cause mydriasis, tachycardia, increased blood\npressure and body temperature, dizziness, decreased appetite, and sweating. Perhaps, the most troubling side effects\nare the loss of judgment and impaired reasoning associated with use of LSD. This can sometimes be an exaggerated\neffect with extreme panic, which is known by individuals as a “bad trip,” and may lead to trauma. Recently, a group\nof synthetic serotonin agonists collectively known as “N-Bomb” have been substituted for LSD. Like LSD, these\nagents are used in liquid form or with blotter paper and have resulted in hypertension, convulsions, and accidental\ntraumatic injury and death.\n1773\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1774 ---\n\nB.  Marijuana\nCannabis is a plant that has been used by humans for over 10,000 years. Centuries-old Chinese documents describe\nthe use of cannabis for clothing production, food, and as an agent to communicate with spirits. Today, marijuana is\nthe most frequently used illicit drug, and the illicit drug that new users are most likely to try ( Figure 45.8). Those\nnumbers are expected to grow as liberalization of marijuana laws continue throughout the United States. Certain\ncannabis plants can be used for making rope or clothing; however, the species Cannabis sativa is the plant most\noften used for its psychoactive properties. The main psychoactive alkaloid contained in marijuana is Δ9-\ntetrahydrocannabinol  [tet-ra-HY-dro-can-NAB-i-nol] (THC ). Growing techniques have evolved over the past 50\nyears, and THC  concentrations found in the plant have increased as much as 20-fold during that time period.\nFigure 45.8 First specific drug associated with initiation of illicit drug use among past-\nyear illicit drug initiates aged 12 or older.\nSpecific receptors in the brain, cannabinoid or CB1 receptors, were discovered in the late 1980s and found to be\nreactive to THC . When CB1 receptors are activated by marijuana, effects include physical relaxation, hyperphagia\n(increased appetite), increased heart rate, decreased muscle coordination, conjunctivitis, and minor pain control\n(Figure 45.9). Depending on the social situation, THC  can produce euphoria, followed by drowsiness and relaxation.\nAlthough hallucinations are typically not as robust as those observed with use of LSD, marijuana is often used for\nthe mild hallucinogenic effects that it produces. Marijuana stimulates the amygdala, causing the user to have a sense\nof novelty to anything the user encounters through an enhancement of sensory activity. For this same reason, heavy\nusers have a down-regulation in their CB1 receptors, leaving them with a feeling of boredom when not taking the\ndrug. The effects of marijuana on γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the hippocampus diminish the capacity for short-\nterm memory in users, and this effect seems to be more pronounced in adolescents. In addition to adversely affecting\n1774\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1775 ---\n\nshort-term memory and mental activity, THC  decreases muscle strength and impairs highly skilled motor activity,\nsuch as that required to drive a car. The effects of THC  appear immediately after smoking marijuana, but maximum\neffects take about 20 minutes. By 3 hours, the effects largely disappear.\n1775\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1776 ---\n\n1776\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1777 ---\n\nFigure 45.9 Effects of tetrahydrocannabinol.\nIn chronic marijuana users, tolerance develops rapidly, 9% of all users and 17% of adolescent users will develop\ndependence, and withdrawal has been observed. Marijuana may be found in the body up to 3 months after last usage\nin heavy chronic users. For this reason, withdrawal occurs much later in individuals who previously used marijuana\nheavily. Withdrawal may include cravings, insomnia, depression, pain, and irritability.\nAlthough not well studied for medicinal use, marijuana has been used as an adjuvant in the treatment of\nchemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), cachexia secondary to cancer and AIDS, epilepsy, chronic\npain, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, and anxiety. Synthetic THC  medications are available as prescription products\nand include dronabinol  [droe-NAB-i-nol] and nabilone [NA-bi-lone]. These medications are used for the prevention\nof CINV. Nabiximols, a medication created from the extract of the Cannabis sativa plant, is an oromucosal spray\navailable in several countries throughout the world for the treatment of spasticity in multiple sclerosis.\n1777\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1778 ---\n\nC.  Synthetic cannabinoids\nSynthetic cannabinoids are sprayed onto plant material in a process known as dusting. These first-generation\nproducts such as “Spice” and “K2” are then smoked to produce intoxication. Since the molecular structure of\nsynthetic cannabinoids is much different from the cannabinoids found in marijuana plants, users do not test positive\nfor THC  with traditional drug tests. Sympathomimetic effects may also be seen in users, including tachycardia and\nhypertension. The greatest danger with use of these agents includes extreme hallucinations and psychotic reactions.\nMore recent formulations of synthetic cannabinoids and their contaminants have caused convulsions, acute kidney\ninjury, and deaths.\n1778\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1779 ---\n\nIV.  Ethanol\nEthanol  (or alcohol) is a clear colorless hydroxylated hydrocarbon that is the product of fermentation of fruits,\ngrains, or vegetables. Ethanol  consumption is a major cause of deadly automobile accidents, drownings, and fatal\nfalls, and is a related factor in many hospital admissions. Ethanol  is the most commonly abused substance in modern\nsociety, with the prevalence of alcohol use disorder as high as 12.6% of the population in some regions of the world.\nAlcoholism decreases life expectancy by 10 to 15 years and impacts one in three families. It is thought that ethanol\nexerts its desired and toxic effects through several mechanisms, including enhanced effects of the inhibitory\nneurotransmitter GABA, increased release of endogenous opioids, and altered levels of serotonin and dopamine.\nEthanol  is a selective CNS depressant at low doses, resulting in decreased inhibitions and the characteristic\nloquaciousness or drunken behavior. At high doses, it is a general CNS depressant, which can result in coma and\nrespiratory depression.\nDrinking ethanol  traditionally has been the most common route of administration, although recently the\ninhalation of aerosolized ethanol  has gained popularity. Ethanol  is absorbed from the stomach and duodenum, and\nfood slows and decreases absorption. Peak ethanol  levels are generally achieved in 20 minutes to 1 hour of\ningestion. There is a greater subjective feeling of intoxication while levels are ascending (absorption), as compared\nto when levels are descending. Ethanol  is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to acetaldehyde and then by\naldehyde dehydrogenase to acetate in the liver (Figure 45.10). It is metabolized by zero-order elimination at\napproximately 15 to 40 mg/dL/h. Because there is a constant blood-to-breath ratio of 2100:1, a breath sample can be\nused to determine blood alcohol levels. Medical management of acute ethanol  toxicity includes symptomatic\nsupportive care and thiamine and folate administration. Patients with extremely high alcohol levels can be dialyzed,\nalthough that is rarely necessary, and could precipitate withdrawal in an alcoholic.\nFigure 45.10 The pathway of ethanol metabolism. ADH = alcohol dehydrogenase;\nALDH = acetaldehyde dehydrogenase.\nChronic ethanol  abuse can cause profound hepatic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, endocrine, metabolic,\nand CNS damage (Figure 45.11). Sudden cessation of ethanol  ingestion in a heavy drinker can precipitate\nwithdrawal manifested by tachycardia, sweating, tremor, anxiety, agitation, hallucinations, and convulsions. Alcohol\nwithdrawal is a life-threatening situation that should be medically managed with symptomatic/supportive care,\n1779\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1780 ---\n\nbenzodiazepines, and long-term addiction treatment. The following are drugs used in the treatment of alcohol\ndependence:\nFigure 45.11 The effects of chronic alcohol abuse.\n1780\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1781 ---\n\nA.  Disulfiram\nDisulfiram [dye-SUL-fi-ram] blocks the oxidation of acetaldehyde to acetic acid by inhibiting aldehyde\ndehydrogenase (Figure 45.12). This results in the accumulation of acetaldehyde in the blood, causing flushing,\ntachycardia, hyperventilation, and nausea. Disulfiram has found some use in patients seriously desiring to stop\nalcohol ingestion. A conditioned avoidance response is induced so that the patient abstains from alcohol to prevent\nthe unpleasant effects of disulfiram-induced acetaldehyde accumulation.\nFigure 45.12 The effect of disulfiram on the metabolism of ethanol.\n1781\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1782 ---\n\nB.  Naltrexone\nNaltrexone [nal-TREX-own] is a competitive and relatively long-acting opioid antagonist that helps decrease\ncravings for alcohol. It should be used in conjunction with supportive psychotherapy. Naltrexone is better tolerated\nthan disulfiram and does not produce the aversive reaction that disulfiram does.\n1782\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1783 ---\n\nC.  Acamprosate\nAcamprosate [a-kam-PROE-sate] is an agent used in alcohol dependence treatment programs and is thought to\ndecrease cravings through its regulatory effects on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-mediated glutamatergic\nexcitation. This agent should also be used in conjunction with supportive psychotherapy.\n1783\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1784 ---\n\nV.  Prescription Drug Abuse\nThis chapter has discussed many of the illicit substances that are abused by individuals. It is important to also\nmention that parts of the world, including the United States and portions of Europe, are currently experiencing an\nepidemic of prescription drug abuse. Some commonly abused prescription drugs include opioids and\nbenzodiazepines. In the United States, between 1997 and 2007, there was a 600% increase in the prescribing of\nopioids, and by 2010, enough opioid prescription pain relievers were sold in the United States to medicate every\nAmerican adult with 5 mg of hydrocodone every 4 hours for 1 month. An increased emphasis on treating pain as the\n“fifth vital sign,” coupled with an exaggerated belief in the beneficial capacity of these medications and a\nminimization of their inherent toxicity among the lay public and health professionals, was among the many possible\nexplanations for the epidemic. Recent efforts have been made to decrease the misuse of prescription opioids, which\nhas resulted in an increased use of heroin, often adulterated with fentanyl  and extremely potent fentanyl  derivatives\nsuch as carfentanil . Reversal of fentanyl  and its derivatives is much more difficult than reversal of opioids such as\nmorphine. This has contributed to a dramatic increase in death rates, with over 33,000 overdose deaths in the United\nStates alone in 2015 (Figure 45.13). Medications for the treatment of opioid toxicity and dependence are reviewed in",

Which adverse effect has\nbeen associated with marijuana and may be a reason for this patient to avoid use of marijuana?\nA.  Short-term memory loss\nB.  Hyperthermia\nC.  Hepatitis\nD.  Hyponatremia\nCorrect answer = A. Short-term memory loss is observed with marijuana use and is more pronounced in\nadolescents. Hyperthermia, hepatitis, and hyponatremia have not been associated with marijuana use.\nA 21-year-old college student is curious about the effects of LSD. She asks what type of risks may be\ninvolved with using the drug for the first time. Which is a correct response to her question?\nA.  Exaggerated hallucinations\nB.  Cardiomyopathy\nC.  Hyperphagia\nD.  Bronchitis\nCorrect answer = A. Exaggerated hallucinations, sometimes known as “bad trips,” may occur, even in first-time\nusers. These hallucinations can lead to extreme panic, which has caused individuals to react in a manner very\nuncharacteristic of their typical behavior.\nA 58-year-old man is brought into the emergency department following an automobile accident. His blood\nalcohol level on admission is 280 mg/dL. He has been treated in the past for seizures related to alcohol\nabuse, and he confirms that he has been drinking heavily over the past month since losing his job. What\ntreatment should be given to this patient if he begins to go into withdrawal while hospitalized?\nA.  Acamprosate\nB.  Lorazepam\nC.  Naltrexone\nD.  Disulfiram\nCorrect answer = B. Should this patient go into alcohol withdrawal, he will likely also have seizures associated\nwith it, given his past history. Benzodiazepines are used to treat seizures associated with alcohol withdrawal.\nAcamprosate, naltrexone, and disulfiram may be considered at a later time to treat the dependence, but would not\nbe useful in the acute withdrawal setting.\nA 35-year-old man has been abusing cocaine and is agitated, tachycardic, hypertensive, and hyperthermic.\nWhich statement is correct regarding treatment in this situation?\nA.  This patient should undergo gastric lavage; that is, he should have his stomach pumped immediately.\nB.  Atropine should be administered to reverse the CNS depression that can occur with cocaine toxicity.\nC.  Benzodiazepines should be administered to calm the patient and decrease heart rate, blood pressure, and body\ntemperature.\nD.  Phenobarbital should be the first choice as an anticonvulsant.\nCorrect answer = C. Benzodiazepines such as lorazepam have anxiolytic properties and can calm a cocaine-toxic\npatient, thereby decreasing heart rate and blood pressure. As the patient becomes less agitated, he/she decreases\nmovement and the body temperature drops. In addition, the use of benzodiazepines decreases the chance of the\npatient experiencing a convulsion and would be the first choice to treat cocaine-induced convulsions.\nA 22-year-old man with a history of substance abuse arrives in the emergency department hypertensive,\nhyperthermic, and tachycardic. He also presents with an altered mental status and hyperreflexia. Which\nsubstance is most likely causing these symptoms?\nA.  LSD\nB.  Bath salts\nC.  Heroin\nD.  Marijuana\nCorrect answer = B: “Bath salts” often contain synthetic cathinones and are labeled, marketed, and sold as\nsomething “not for human consumption” to avoid law enforcement and prosecution. In addition, they are usually\nnot detected on urine toxicology screening so often evaluation of symptoms are used to distinguish the substance\ntaken. These products can cause an amphetamine-like sympathomimetic toxidrome, as well as serotonin\nsyndrome, which would be treated with symptomatic/supportive care and possibly a serotonin antagonist such as\ncyproheptadine. LSD and marijuana would produce mostly psychological symptoms such as hallucinations and\nparanoia, and opioids would produce depressive symptoms such as respiratory depression, hyperthermia, and\nstupor.1785\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1786 ---\n\n45.6\n45.7\n45.8\n45.9\n45.10THC is a psychoactive alkaloid found in:\nA.  N-bomb\nB.  K2\nC.  LSD\nD.  Marijuana\nCorrect answer = D. THC is the main psychoactive alkaloid contained in marijuana. N-bomb is a synthetic\nhallucinogen derived from mescaline. K2, also known as Spice or synthetic cannabis, is dried plant material,\nwhich has been sprayed with synthetic chemicals that cause psychoactive effects. K2 does not contain THC. LSD\nis also a psychoactive drug but contains lysergic acid diethylamine.\nWhich drug has clinical effects similar to those of cocaine?\nA.  LSD\nB.  Marijuana\nC.  Methamphetamine\nD.  Ethanol\nCorrect answer = C. Cocaine and methamphetamine have similar stimulant effects such as alertness, anxiety,\ntachycardia, hypertension, and hyperthermia. This can lead to arrhythmias, stroke, or myocardial infarction. LSD\nand marijuana cause primarily psychoactive effects such as hallucinations and paranoia, but have negligible to\nminimal stimulant effects. Ethanol is a depressant, which often will produce the opposite effects of stimulants\nincluding relaxation, drowsiness, and in high doses hypothermia.\nWhich drug leads to the formation of a cardiotoxic metabolite when administered with cocaine?\nA.  Lorazepam\nB.  Marijuana\nC.  Ethanol\nD.  Khat\nCorrect answer = C. Cocaine combined with ethanol forms cocaethylene, which may lead to aggressive and\nimpulsive behaviors as well as the potential for sudden myocardial infarction.\nWhich agent is often found as an adulterant in heroin and has led to an increase in overdose deaths?\nA.  Spice\nB.  Fentanyl\nC.  Marijuana\nD.  Cathinones\nCorrect answer = B. Fentanyl and its multitude of derivatives are often found in samples of heroin. Fentanyl\nderivatives are often many times more potent than heroin or fentanyl, which has led to an alarming number of\noverdoses in recent years.\nDeath secondary to MDMA use has occurred secondary to which adverse effect?\nA.  Respiratory depression\nB.  Acute kidney injury\nC.  CNS depression\nD.  Hyperthermia\nCorrect answer = D. MDMA, or Ecstasy, is a stimulant with similar properties to cocaine. The stimulant effects\nmay include hyperthermia, hypertension, and tachycardia.1786\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1787 ---\n\n46\nAntiprotozoal Drugs\nMarylee V. Worley and Jonathan C. Cho\n1787\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1788 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nProtozoan parasites that cause human diseases are prevalent in underdeveloped tropical and subtropical countries,\nwhere sanitary conditions, hygienic practices, and control of the vectors of transmission are inadequate. However,\nwith increased world travel, protozoal diseases are no longer confined to specific geographic locales. Because they\nare unicellular eukaryotes, the protozoal cells have metabolic processes closer to those of the human host than to\nprokaryotic bacterial pathogens. Therefore, protozoal diseases are less easily treated than bacterial infections, and\nmany of the antiprotozoal drugs cause serious toxic effects in the host, particularly on cells showing high metabolic\nactivity. Most antiprotozoal agents have not proven to be safe for pregnant patients. Drugs used to treat protozoal\ninfections are listed in Figure 46.1. [Note: Some of the drugs discussed below are not available in the United States;\nhowever, most can be obtained by contacting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.]\n1788\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1789 ---\n\n1789\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1790 ---\n\nFigure 46.1 Summary of antiprotozoal agents.\n1790\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1791 ---\n\nII.  Chemotherapy for Amebiasis\nAmebiasis (amebic dysentery) is an infection of the intestinal tract caused by Entamoeba histolytica . E. histolytica  is\nendemic in developing countries and is mainly transmitted via the fecal–oral route or through ingestion of\ncontaminated food or water. Most infected individuals are asymptomatic but can exhibit varying degrees of illness\ndepending on host factors and formation of trophozoites. The diagnosis is established by isolating E. histolytica\nfrom feces. Due to the risk of developing invasive disease and acting as a potential source of infection for others,\ntherapy is indicated for acutely ill patients and asymptomatic carriers of E. histolytica.  A summary of the life cycle\nof E. histolytica  is presented in Figure 46.2. Therapeutic agents for amebiasis are classified as luminal, systemic, or\nmixed amebicides according to the site of action (Figure 46.2). For example, luminal amebicides act on the parasite\nin the lumen of the bowel, whereas systemic amebicides are effective against amebas in the intestinal wall and liver.\nMixed amebicides are effective against both the luminal and systemic forms of the disease, although luminal\nconcentrations are too low for single-drug treatment.\nFigure 46.2 Life cycle of E. histolytica , showing the sites of action of amebicidal drugs.\n1791\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1792 ---\n\nA.  Mixed amebicides\n1.  Metronidazole\nMetronidazole [me-troe-NYE-da-zole], a nitroimidazole, is the mixed amebicide of choice for treating amebic\ninfections. [Note: Metronidazole is also used in the treatment of infections caused by Giardia lamblia , Trichomonas\nvaginalis , anaerobic cocci, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (for example, Bacteroides  species), and anaerobic, gram-\npositive bacilli (for example, Clostridium difficile) .]\na.  Mechanism of action\nAmebas possess ferredoxin-like, low-redox-potential, electron transport proteins that participate in metabolic\nelectron removal reactions. The nitro group of metronidazole is able to serve as an electron acceptor, forming\nreduced cytotoxic compounds that bind to proteins and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), resulting in death of the E .\nhistolytica  trophozoites.\nb.  Pharmacokinetics\nMetronidazole is completely and rapidly absorbed after oral administration. [Note: For the treatment of amebiasis, it\nis usually administered with a luminal amebicide, such as iodoquinol  or paromomycin. This combination provides\ncure rates of greater than 90%.] Metronidazole distributes well throughout body tissues and fluids. Therapeutic\nlevels can be found in vaginal and seminal fluids, saliva, breast milk, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Metabolism of\nthe drug depends on hepatic oxidation of the metronidazole side chain by mixed-function oxidase, followed by\nglucuronidation. Therefore, concomitant treatment with inducers of the cytochrome P450, such as phenobarbital ,\nenhances the rate of metabolism, and inhibitors, such as cimetidine, prolong the plasma half-life of metronidazole.\nThe drug accumulates in patients with severe hepatic disease. The parent drug and its metabolites are excreted in the\nurine.\nc.  Adverse effects\nThe most common adverse effects are nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress, and abdominal cramps ( Figure 46.3). An\nunpleasant, metallic taste is commonly experienced. Other effects include oral moniliasis (yeast infection of the\nmouth) and, rarely, neurotoxicity (dizziness, vertigo, and numbness or paresthesia), which may necessitate\ndiscontinuation of the drug. If taken with alcohol, a disulfiram-like reaction may occur (see",

Tinidazole\nTinidazole [tye-NI-da-zole] is a second-generation nitroimidazole that is similar to metronidazole in spectrum of\nactivity, absorption, adverse effects, and drug interactions. It is used for treatment of amebiasis, amebic liver\nabscess, giardiasis, and trichomoniasis. Tinidazole is as effective as metronidazole, but it is more expensive. Alcohol\nconsumption should be avoided during therapy.\n1793\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1794 ---\n\nB.  Luminal amebicides\nAfter treatment of invasive intestinal or extraintestinal amebic disease is complete, a luminal agent, such as\niodoquinol , diloxanide furoate, or paromomycin, should be administered for treatment of the asymptomatic\ncolonization state.\n1.  Iodoquinol\nIodoquinol  [eye-oh-doe-QUIN-ole], a halogenated 8-hydroxyquinolone, is amebicidal against E . histolytica  and is\neffective against the luminal trophozoite and cyst forms. Adverse effects of iodoquinol  include rash, diarrhea, and\ndose-related peripheral neuropathy, including a rare optic neuritis. Long-term use of this drug should be avoided.\n2.  Paromomycin\nParomomycin [par-oh-moe-MYE-sin], an aminoglycoside antibiotic, is only effective against the luminal forms of\nE. histolytica , because it is not significantly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Paromomycin is directly\namebicidal and also exerts its antiamebic actions by reducing the population of intestinal flora. Gastrointestinal\ndistress and diarrhea are the principal adverse effects.\n1794\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1795 ---\n\nC.  Systemic amebicides\nThese drugs are useful for treating extraintestinal amebiasis, such as liver abscesses, and intestinal wall infections\ncaused by amebas.\n1.  Chloroquine\nChloroquine [KLOR-oh-kwin] is used in combination with metronidazole (or as a substitute for one of the\nnitroimidazoles in the case of intolerance) to treat amebic liver abscesses. It eliminates trophozoites in liver\nabscesses, but it is not useful in treating luminal amebiasis. Therapy should be followed with a luminal amebicide.\nChloroquine is also effective in the treatment of malaria.\n2.  Dehydroemetine\nDehydroemetine [de-hye-dro-EM-e-teen] is an alternative agent for the treatment of amebiasis. The drug inhibits\nprotein synthesis by blocking chain elongation. Intramuscular (IM) injection is the preferred route, since it is an\nirritant when taken orally. The use of this ipecac alkaloid is limited by its toxicity, and it has largely been replaced\nby metronidazole. Adverse effects include pain at the site of injection, nausea, cardiotoxicity (arrhythmias and\ncongestive heart failure), neuromuscular weakness, dizziness, and rash. A summary of the treatment of amebiasis is\nshown in Figure 46.4.\nFigure 46.4 Some commonly used therapeutic options for the treatment of amebiasis.\n1795\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1796 ---\n\nIII.  Chemotherapy for Malaria\nMalaria is an acute infectious disease caused by five species of the protozoal genus Plasmodium . It is transmitted to\nhumans through the bite of a female Anopheles  mosquito. The classic presentation of malaria begins with headache\nand fatigue, followed by fever, chills, and sweats. Plasmodium falciparum  is the most dangerous species and the\nprimary cause of severe malaria, causing an acute, rapidly fulminating disease characterized by persistent high fever,\nhyperparasitemia, and organ system dysfunction. Plasmodium falciparum  infection can lead to capillary obstruction,\ncerebral malaria, and death within days without prompt treatment. Plasmodium vivax , malariae,  and ovale  cause a\nmilder form of the disease; however, the P . vivax  and P . ovale  species can also remain dormant in the liver\n(hypnozoite stage), which can cause relapses months or years later. Plasmodium knowlesi  is an uncommon form of\nmalaria, previously thought to infect only nonhuman primates, which causes human infections, sometimes severe, in\nSoutheast Asia. Resistance acquired by Plasmodium to antiprotozoal drugs has led to new therapeutic challenges,\nparticularly in the treatment of P . falciparum . A summary of the life cycle of the parasite and the sites of action of\nthe antimalarial drugs are presented in Figure 46.5.\nFigure 46.5 Life cycle of the malarial parasite, showing the sites of action of antimalarial\ndrugs.\n1796\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1797 ---\n\nA.  Primaquine\nPrimaquine [PRIM-a-kwin], an 8-aminoquinoline, is an oral antimalarial drug that eradicates primary\nexoerythrocytic (liver) forms of plasmodia and the hypnozoites of recurring malarias (P . vivax  and P . ovale ). [Note:\nPrimaquine is the only agent that prevents relapses of the P . vivax  and P . ovale  malarias, which may remain in the\nliver in the hypnozoite form after the erythrocytic form of the disease is eliminated.] The sexual (gametocytic) forms\nof all plasmodia are destroyed in the plasma or are prevented from maturing later in the mosquito, thereby\ninterrupting transmission of the disease. [Note: Primaquine is not effective against the erythrocytic stage of malaria\nand, therefore, it cannot be used as monotherapy for treatment.]\n1.  Mechanism of action\nWhile not completely understood, metabolites of primaquine are believed to act as oxidants that severely disrupt the\nmetabolic processes of plasmodial mitochondria. The metabolites are responsible for the schizonticidal action, as\nwell as for the hemolysis and methemoglobinemia encountered as toxicities.\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\nPrimaquine is well absorbed after oral administration and is not concentrated in tissues. It is rapidly oxidized to\nmany compounds, primarily the deaminated drug. Which compound possesses the schizonticidal activity has not\nbeen established. The drug is minimally excreted in the urine.\n3.  Adverse effects\nPrimaquine is associated with drug-induced hemolytic anemia in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase\ndeficiency (Figure 46.6). Large doses of the drug may cause abdominal discomfort (especially when administered in\ncombination with chloroquine) and occasional methemoglobinemia. Primaquine should not be used during\npregnancy. All Plasmodium species may develop resistance to primaquine.\n1797\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1798 ---\n\nFigure 46.6 Mechanism of primaquine-induced hemolytic anemia. GSH = reduced\nglutathione; GSSG = oxidized glutathione; NADP+ = nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide\nphosphate; NADPH = reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate.\n1798\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1799 ---\n\nB.  Chloroquine\nChloroquine is a synthetic 4-aminoquinoline that had been the mainstay of antimalarial therapy for many years;\nhowever, the use is now limited due to P . falciparum  resistance, which is seen in almost all malaria-endemic areas,\nexcept some parts of Central America. Chloroquine is less effective against P . vivax  malaria. Chloroquine is used in\nthe prophylaxis of malaria for travel to areas with known chloroquine-sensitive malaria. It is also effective in the\ntreatment of extraintestinal amebiasis.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nAlthough the mechanism of action is not fully understood, the processes essential for the antimalarial action of\nchloroquine are outlined in Figure 46.7. After traversing the erythrocytic and plasmodial membranes, chloroquine (a\ndiprotic weak base) is concentrated in the acidic food vacuole of the malarial parasite, primarily by ion trapping. In\nthe food vacuole, the parasite digests the host cell’s hemoglobin to obtain essential amino acids. However, this\nprocess also releases large amounts of soluble heme, which is toxic to the parasite. To protect itself, the parasite\npolymerizes the heme to hemozoin (a pigment), which is sequestered in the food vacuole. Chloroquine specifically\nbinds to heme, preventing its polymerization to hemozoin. The increased pH and the accumulation of heme result in\noxidative damage to the phospholipid membranes, leading to lysis of both the parasite and the red blood cell.\nFigure 46.7 Action of chloroquine on the formation of hemozoin by Plasmodium\nspecies.\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\nChloroquine is rapidly and completely absorbed following oral administration. The drug has a very large volume of\ndistribution and concentrates in erythrocytes, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, melanin-containing tissues, and leukocytes.\nIt persists in erythrocytes. The drug also penetrates the central nervous system (CNS) and traverses the placenta.\nChloroquine is dealkylated by the hepatic mixed-function oxidase system, and some metabolic products retain\nantimalarial activity. Both parent drug and metabolites are excreted predominantly in urine.\n3.  Adverse effects\nAdverse effects are minimal at low prophylactic doses. At higher doses, gastrointestinal upset, pruritus, headaches,\nand blurred vision may occur ( Figure 46.8). An ophthalmologic examination should be routinely performed during\nextended use due to potential retinal toxicity. Discoloration of the nail beds and mucous membranes may be seen on\nchronic administration. Chloroquine should be used cautiously in patients with hepatic dysfunction, severe\ngastrointestinal problems, or neurologic disorders. Patients with psoriasis or porphyria should not be treated with\nchloroquine, because an acute attack may be provoked. Chloroquine can prolong the QT interval, and use of other\ndrugs that also cause QT prolongation should be avoided if possible.\n1799\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1800 ---\n\nFigure 46.8 Some adverse effects commonly associated with chloroquine. GI =\ngastrointestinal.\n1800\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1801 ---\n\nC.  Atovaquone–proguanil\nThe combination of atovaquone–proguanil  [a-TOE-va-kwone pro-GWA-nil] is effective for chloroquine-resistant\nstrains of P . falciparum , and it is used in the prevention and treatment of malaria for travelers from outside malaria-\nendemic areas. Atovaquone–proguanil  is not routinely used in endemic areas due to propensity for emergence of\nhigh-level resistance. Atovaquone is a hydroxynaphthoquinone which inhibits mitochondrial processes including\nelectron transport, as well as ATP and pyrimidine biosynthesis. Cycloguanil, the active triazine metabolite of\nproguanil , inhibits plasmodial dihydrofolate reductase, thereby preventing DNA synthesis. Atovaquone also may be\nused to treat Babesia  sp. and Pneumocystis jirovecii . Proguanil  is metabolized via CYP2C19, an isoenzyme that is\nknown to exhibit a genetic polymorphism resulting in poor metabolism of the drug in some patients. The\ncombination should be taken with food or milk to enhance absorption. Common adverse effects include nausea,\nvomiting, abdominal pain, headache, diarrhea, anorexia, and dizziness.\n1801\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1802 ---\n\nD.  Mefloquine\nMefloquine [MEF-lo-kwin] is a 4-methanolquinoline, structurally related to quinine, which is an effective agent for\nprophylaxis from all plasmodia, and for treatment when used in combination with an artemisinin derivative for\ninfections caused by multidrug-resistant forms of P . falciparum . Its exact mechanism of action remains\nundetermined. Resistant strains have been identified, particularly in Southeast Asia. Mefloquine is well absorbed\nafter oral administration and is widely distributed to tissues. It has a long half-life (20 days) because of enterohepatic\nrecirculation and its concentration in various tissues. The drug undergoes extensive metabolism and is primarily\nexcreted via the bile into the feces. Adverse reactions at high doses range from nausea, vomiting, and dizziness to\ndisorientation, hallucinations, and depression. Because of the potential for neuropsychiatric reactions, mefloquine is\nusually reserved for treatment of malaria when other agents cannot be used. Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities\nand cardiac arrest are possible if mefloquine is taken concurrently with quinine or quinidine.\n1802\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1803 ---\n\nE.  Quinine\nQuinine [KWYE-nine], an alkaloid originally isolated from the bark of the cinchona tree, interferes with heme\npolymerization, resulting in death of the erythrocytic form of the plasmodial parasite. It is reserved for severe\ninfections and for chloroquine-resistant malarial strains. Quinine is usually administered in combination with\ndoxycycline, tetracycline, or clindamycin. Taken orally, quinine is well distributed throughout the body. The major\nadverse effect of quinine is cinchonism, a syndrome causing nausea, vomiting, tinnitus, and vertigo. These effects\nare reversible and are not reasons for suspending therapy. However, quinine treatment should be suspended if\nhemolytic anemia occurs.\n1803\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1804 ---\n\nF.  Artemisinin\nArtemisinin [ar-te-MIS-in-in] is derived from the sweet wormwood plant, which has been used in traditional Chinese\nmedicine for many centuries. Artemisinin and its derivatives are recommended first-line agents for the treatment of\nmultidrug-resistant P . falciparum  malaria. Addition of another antimalarial agent, or artemisinin-based combination\ntherapy (ACT), is recommended to prevent the development of resistance. One orally available ACT includes a\ntablet with artemether coformulated with lumefantrine [AR-te-meth-er/loo-me-FAN-treen] and is used for the\ntreatment of uncomplicated malaria. [Note: Lumefantrine is an antimalarial drug similar in action to quinine or\nmefloquine.] Artesunate [ar-TEZ-oo-nate] may be combined with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine, mefloquine,\nclindamycin, or others. The antimalarial action of artemisinin derivatives involves the production of free radicals\nresulting from cleavage of the drug’s endoperoxide bridge by heme iron in the parasite food vacuole. Oral, rectal,\nIM and intravenous (IV) preparations are available, but the short half-lives preclude the use of these drugs for\nprophylaxis. Adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. High doses may cause prolongation of the QT\ninterval. Hypersensitivity reactions and rash have occurred.\n1804\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1805 ---\n\nG.  Pyrimethamine\nPyrimethamine [peer-i-METH-a-meen] inhibits plasmodial dihydrofolate reductase required for the synthesis of\ntetrahydrofolate (a cofactor needed for synthesis of nucleic acids). It acts as a blood schizonticide and a strong\nsporonticide when the mosquito ingests it with the blood of the human host. Pyrimethamine is not used alone for\nmalaria; it is available as a fixed-dose combination with sulfadoxine, a sulfonamide antimicrobial. Resistance to this\ncombination has developed, so it is usually administered with other agents, such as artemisinin derivatives.\nPyrimethamine in combination with sulfadiazine is also used against Toxoplasma gondii. If megaloblastic anemia\noccurs with pyrimethamine treatment, it may be reversed with leucovorin. Figure 46.9 shows some therapeutic\noptions in the treatment of malaria.\nFigure 46.9 Treatment and prevention of malaria.*Only for use in travelers outside\nmalaria-endemic areas or added to combination regimen for alternative treatment\nregimens.†Artemisinin-based combination therapy is preferred according to World Health\nOrganization.\n1805\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1806 ---\n\n1806\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1807 ---\n\nIV.  Chemotherapy for Trypanosomiasis\nAfrican trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) and American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease) are two chronic and,\neventually, fatal diseases caused by species of Trypanosoma  (Figure 46.10). In African sleeping sickness, T . brucei\ngambiense  and T . brucei rhodesiense  initially live and grow in the blood. The parasite later invades the CNS,\ncausing inflammation of the brain and spinal cord that produces the characteristic lethargy and, eventually,\ncontinuous sleep. Chagas disease is caused by T. cruzi  and is endemic in Central and South America.\nAntitrypanosomal drugs are outlined below.\n1807\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1808 ---\n\nFigure 46.10 Summary of trypanosomiasis. CNS = central nervous system.\n1808\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1809 ---\n\n1809\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1810 ---\n\nA.  Pentamidine\nPentamidine [pen-TAM-i-deen] is active against a variety of protozoal infections, including African trypanosomiasis\ndue to T . brucei gambiense , for which it is used to treat the early stages of disease (hemolymphatic stage without\nCNS involvement). Pentamidine is also an alternative for prophylaxis or treatment of infections caused by\nPneumocystis jirovecii . [Note: P. jirovecii  is an atypical fungus that causes pneumonia in immunocompromised\npatients, such as those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is\npreferred in the treatment of P . jirovecii  infections; however, pentamidine is an alternative in individuals who are\nallergic to sulfonamides.] Pentamidine is also an alternative drug for the treatment of leishmaniasis.\n1.  Mechanism of action\nT. brucei  concentrates pentamidine by an energy-dependent, high-affinity uptake system. [Note: Resistance is\nassociated with inability to concentrate the drug.] Although its mechanism of action has not been defined, evidence\nexists that the drug interferes with parasite synthesis of ribonucleic acid (RNA), DNA, phospholipids, and proteins.\n2.  Pharmacokinetics\nPentamidine is administered intramuscularly or intravenously for the treatment of trypanosomiasis and pneumonia\ncaused by P . jirovecii . [Note: For prophylaxis of P . jirovecii  pneumonia, pentamidine is administered via nebulizer.]\nThe drug distributes widely and is concentrated in the liver, kidney, adrenals, spleen, and lungs. Because it does not\nenter the CSF, it is ineffective against the late stages (CNS involvement) of trypanosomiasis. The drug is not\nmetabolized, and it is excreted very slowly in the urine.\n3.  Adverse effects\nSerious renal dysfunction may occur, which is reversible on discontinuation. Other adverse reactions include\nhyperkalemia, hypotension, pancreatitis, ventricular arrhythmias, and hyperglycemia. Plasma glucose should be\nmonitored, as life threatening hypoglycemia can occur.\n1810\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1811 ---\n\nB.  Suramin\nSuramin [SOO-ra-min] is used primarily in the early stage (without CNS involvement) of African trypanosomiasis\ndue to T . brucei rhodesiense . It is very reactive and inhibits many enzymes, especially those involved in energy\nmetabolism, which appears to be the mechanism correlated with trypanocidal activity. Suramin must be injected\nintravenously. It binds to plasma proteins and does not penetrate the blood–brain barrier well. It has a long\nelimination half-life (greater than 40 days) and is mainly excreted unchanged in the urine. Although infrequent,\nadverse reactions include nausea and vomiting, shock and loss of consciousness, acute urticaria, blepharitis, and\nneurologic problems, such as paresthesia, photophobia, and hyperesthesia of the hands and feet. Renal insufficiency\nmay occur but tends to resolve with discontinuation of treatment. Acute hypersensitivity reactions may occur, and a\ntest dose should be given prior to drug administration.\n1811\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1812 ---\n\nC.  Melarsoprol\nMelarsoprol  [mel-AR-so-prol], a trivalent arsenical compound, is the only medication available for treatment of late\nstages of African trypanosome infections (CNS involvement) due to T . brucei rhodesiense . The drug reacts with\nsulfhydryl groups of various substances, including enzymes in both the organism and host. Some resistance has been\nnoted, and it may be due to decreased transporter uptake of the drug. Melarsoprol  is administered by slow IV\ninjection and can be very irritating to the surrounding tissue. Adequate trypanocidal concentrations appear in the\nCSF, making melarsoprol  the agent of choice in the treatment of T. brucei rhodesiense, which rapidly invades the\nCNS. The host readily oxidizes melarsoprol  to a relatively nontoxic, pentavalent arsenic compound. The drug has a\nvery short half-life and is rapidly excreted in urine. The use of melarsoprol  is limited by CNS toxicity, including\nreactive encephalopathy, which can be fatal in 10% of cases. Other adverse effects include peripheral neuropathy,\nhypertension, hepatotoxicity, and albuminuria. Hypersensitivity reactions may also occur, and febrile reactions may\nfollow injection. Hemolytic anemia has been seen in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.\n1812\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1813 ---\n\nD.  Eflornithine\nEflornithine [ee-FLOOR-nih-theen] is an irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase. Inhibition of this enzyme\nhalts the production of polyamines in the parasite, thereby leading to cessation of cell division. The IV formulation\nof eflornithine is a first-line treatment for late-stage African trypanosomiasis caused by T. brucei gambiense . [Note:\nTopical eflornithine is used as a treatment for unwanted facial hair in women.] The short half-life of eflornithine\nnecessitates frequent IV administration, making the treatment regimen difficult to follow. Eflornithine is less toxic\nthan melarsoprol , although the drug is associated with anemia, seizures, and temporary hearing loss.\n1813\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1814 ---\n\nE.  Nifurtimox\nNifurtimox [nye-FER-tim-oks] is used in the treatment of T . cruzi  infections (Chagas disease), although treatment of\nthe chronic stage of such infections has led to variable results. It may also be useful for the treatment of late-stage T .\nbrucei gambiense  in combination with eflornithine. Being a nitroaromatic compound, nifurtimox undergoes\nreduction and eventually generates intracellular oxygen radicals, such as superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide\n(Figure 46.11). These highly reactive radicals are toxic to T . cruzi . Nifurtimox is administered orally. It is\nextensively metabolized, and the metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine. Adverse effects are common\nfollowing chronic administration, particularly among the elderly. Major toxicities include hypersensitivity reactions\n(anaphylaxis, dermatitis) and gastrointestinal problems that may be severe enough to cause weight loss. Peripheral\nneuropathy is relatively common, and headache and dizziness may also occur.\n1814\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1815 ---\n\n1815\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1816 ---\n\nFigure 46.11 Generation of toxic intermediates by nifurtimox .\n1816\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1817 ---\n\nF.  Benznidazole\nBenznidazole [benz-NI-da-zole] is a nitroimidazole derivative with a mechanism of action similar to nifurtimox. It\ntends to be better tolerated than nifurtimox for the treatment of Chagas disease. Adverse effects include dermatitis,\nperipheral neuropathy, insomnia, and anorexia.\n1817\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1818 ---\n\nV.  Chemotherapy for Leishmaniasis\nLeishmaniasis is a protozoal infection caused by various species of the genus Leishmania . There are three\nmanifestations of leishmaniasis: cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and visceral. [Note: In the visceral type (liver and\nspleen), the parasite is in the bloodstream and if untreated is fatal.] Leishmaniasis is transmitted by the bite of\ninfected sandflies. For visceral leishmaniasis, parenteral treatments may include amphotericin B  (see",

Sodium stibogluconate\nThe pentavalent antimonial sodium stibogluconate [stib-o-GLOO-koe-nate] is a prodrug which is reduced to the\nactive trivalent antimonial compound. The exact mechanism of action has not been determined. Because it is not\nabsorbed after oral administration, sodium stibogluconate must be administered parenterally, and it is distributed in\nthe extravascular compartment. Metabolism is minimal, and the drug is excreted in urine. Adverse effects include\ninjection site pain, pancreatitis, elevated liver enzymes, arthralgias, myalgias, gastrointestinal upset, and cardiac\narrhythmias. Resistance to the pentavalent antimonials has developed.\n1819\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1820 ---\n\nB.  Miltefosine\nMiltefosine [mil-te-FOE-zeen] is the first orally active drug for visceral leishmaniasis and can also treat cutaneous\nand mucocutaneous forms of the disease. The precise mechanism of action is not known, but miltefosine appears to\ninterfere with phospholipids and sterols in the parasitic cell membrane to induce apoptosis. Nausea and vomiting are\ncommon adverse reactions. The drug is teratogenic and should be avoided in pregnancy.\n1820\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1821 ---\n\nVI.  Chemotherapy for Toxoplasmosis\nOne of the most common infections in humans is caused by the protozoan T . gondii , which is transmitted to humans\nwhen they consume raw, inadequately cooked infected meat, or accidentally ingest oocysts from cat feces. An\ninfected pregnant woman can transmit T . gondii  to her fetus. The treatment of choice for this condition is a\ncombination of sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine. Leucovorin is commonly administered to protect against folate\ndeficiency. [Note: At the first appearance of a rash, pyrimethamine should be discontinued, because hypersensitivity\nto this drug can be severe.] Pyrimethamine with clindamycin or the combination of trimethoprim and\nsulfamethoxazole are alternative treatments. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is used for prophylaxis against\ntoxoplasmosis (as well as P . jirovecii ) in immunocompromised patients.\n1821\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1822 ---\n\nVII.  Chemotherapy for Giardiasis\nGiardia lamblia  is the most commonly diagnosed intestinal parasite in the United States. It has two life cycle stages:\nthe binucleate trophozoite with four flagella, and the drug-resistant, four-nucleate cyst (Figure 46.12). Ingestion\nusually occurs from fecally contaminated drinking water or food, leading to infection. The trophozoites exist in the\nsmall intestine and divide by binary fission. Occasionally, cysts are formed that pass out in stools. Although some\ninfections are asymptomatic, severe diarrhea can occur, which can be very serious in immunocompromised patients.\nThe treatment of choice is oral metronidazole for 5 days. An alternative is a single dose of tinidazole, which is as\neffective as metronidazole in the treatment of giardiasis. Nitazoxanide [nye-ta-ZOX-a-nide], a nitrothiazole\nderivative, is also approved for the treatment of giardiasis. [Note: Nitazoxanide may also be used for\ncryptosporidiosis (a diarrheal illness most commonly seen in immunocompromised patients) caused by the parasite\nCryptosporidium parvum.] For giardiasis, nitazoxanide is administered as a 3-day course of oral therapy. The\nanthelmintic drug albendazole may also be efficacious for giardiasis, and paromomycin is sometimes used for\ntreatment of giardiasis in pregnant patients.\n1822\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1823 ---\n\nFigure 46.12 Life cycle of Giardia lamblia .\n1823\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1824 ---\n\n46.1\n46.2\n46.3\n46.4\n46.5\n46.6Study Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nAfter the acute infection, which medication is given to treat the asymptomatic colonization state of E .\nhistolytica ?\nA.  Chloroquine\nB.  Iodoquinol\nC.  Metronidazole\nD.  Primaquine\nCorrect answer = B. Iodoquinol, diloxanide furoate, and paromomycin are luminal amebicides that are usually\nadministered with mixed or systemic amebicides to treat the asymptomatic colonization state. Chloroquine is a\nsystemic amebicide and an antimalarial. Metronidazole is a mixed amebicide. Primaquine is an antimalarial.\nA group of college students are traveling to a chloroquine-resistant malaria area for a mission trip. Which\nmedication can be used to both prevent and treat malaria in these students?\nA.  Pyrimethamine\nB.  Artemisinin\nC.  Atovaquone–proguanil\nD.  Hydroxychloroquine\nCorrect answer = C. The combination of atovaquone–proguanil has been used for both prevention and treatment\nof malaria in chloroquine-resistant areas. Pyrimethamine is not recommended for prophylaxis of malaria.\nArtemisinin and its derivatives are not used for prophylaxis, only treatment of malaria. Hydroxychloroquine is\nonly an alternative treatment or prophylaxis option in chloroquine-sensitive regions.\nWhich agent is available as an oral therapy for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis?\nA.  Artemether/lumefantrine\nB.  Miltefosine\nC.  Nitazoxanide\nD.  Tinidazole\nCorrect answer = B. Miltefosine is the only oral agent available for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis. All the\nother drugs are orally administered, but artemether/lumefantrine is used for the treatment of malaria, nitazoxanide\nis used for the treatment of giardiasis or cryptosporidiosis, and tinidazole is effective for amebiasis or giardiasis.\nA 27-year-old woman is diagnosed with African trypanosomal infection due to T. brucei rhodesiense. Which\nmedication would be the best for this patient?\nA.  Eflornithine\nB.  Suramin\nC.  Sodium stibogluconate\nD.  Metronidazole\nCorrect answer = B. Eflornithine is indicated for the treatment of African trypanosomiasis caused by T. bruceigambiense . Suramin is used for the treatment of first-stage African trypanosomiasis due to T. brucei rhodesiense .\nSodium stibogluconate is used for the treatment of leishmaniasis. Metronidazole is used for the treatment of\namebiasis and giardiasis.\nWhich agent is the only medication to treat late stages of trypanosomal infections due to T. bruceirhodesiense ?\nA.  Artemether/lumefantrine\nB.  Melarsoprol\nC.  Nitazoxanide\nD.  Tinidazole\nCorrect answer = B. Melarsoprol is the only agent available for the treatment of late stage trypanosomal\ninfections due to T. brucei rhodesiense. All the other drugs are used for other indications; artemether/lumefantrine\nis used for the treatment of malaria, nitazoxanide is used for the treatment of giardiasis or cryptosporidiosis, and\ntinidazole is effective for amebiasis or giardiasis.\nA 42-year-old man returned from a camping trip and is diagnosed with Giardia lamblia. Which medication\nwould be considered the treatment of choice?\nA.  Chloroquine\nB.  Nifurtimox\nC.  Paromomycin\nD.  Metronidazole 1824\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1825 ---\n\n46.7\n46.8\n46.9\n46.10Correct answer = D. Metronidazole is used for the treatment of amebiasis and giardiasis. Chloroquine is used for\nthe treatment of malaria and extra intestinal amebiasis. Nifurtimox is indicated for the treatment of American\ntrypanosomiasis (Chagas disease) caused by T. cruzi. Paromomycin is used for the treatment of luminal forms of\nE. histolytica .\nWhich statement regarding paromomycin is correct?\nA.  Paromomycin is only effective against the luminal forms of E. histolytica .\nB.  The principle adverse effects are optic neuritis and peripheral neuropathy.\nC.  Paromomycin is considered a nitroimidazole.\nD.  If taken with alcohol, a disulfiram-like reaction may occur.\nCorrect answer = A. Paromomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic, known as a luminal amebicide. It is only\nactive effective against the luminal forms of E. histolytica because it is not significantly absorbed from the\ngastrointestinal tract. The principle adverse effects are gastrointestinal distress and diarrhea. The nitroimidazoles\nshould be avoided with alcohol consumption due to the risk of a disulfiram-like reaction.\nWhich treatment option is most appropriate for a patient diagnosed with uncomplicated malaria due to P.\novale ?\nA.  Artesunate plus mefloquine\nB.  Doxycycline\nC.  Chloroquine\nD.  Chloroquine plus primaquine\nCorrect answer = D. Chloroquine plus primaquine is the most appropriate treatment option due to the species of\nmalaria, P. ovale , which causes relapses from the dormant hypnozoite form unless primaquine is added.\nChloroquine by itself would treat the acute infection; however, it would not prevent relapse of the disease.\nDoxycycline is only used for prophylaxis or as a combination with other antimalarial medications for treatment.\nArtesunate plus mefloquine would be more appropriate to treat severe malaria; however, neither agent would\nprevent the relapsing form of the disease caused by P. ovale .\nWhich antiprotozoal agent is active against Toxoplasma gondii ?\nA.  Metronidazole\nB.  Pyrimethamine\nC.  Leucovorin\nD.  Miltefosine\nCorrect answer= B. Pyrimethamine is active against T. gondii and in combination with sulfadiazine is the\ntreatment of choice for toxoplasmosis. Metronidazole is active against amebiasis and giardiasis. Leucovorin can\nbe used during the treatment of toxoplasmosis; however, its actions are to protect against folate deficiency caused\nby the treatment, and the drug itself does not have antiprotozoal activity. Miltefosine is used for leishmaniasis.\nA 32-year-old pregnant woman is traveling abroad to a malaria-endemic country with known chloroquine\nresistance. Which prophylactic regimen is most  appropriate?\nA.  Doxycycline\nB.  Mefloquine\nC.  Primaquine\nD.  Artemether–lumefantrine\nCorrect answer = B. Mefloquine is one of the preferred regimens for malaria prophylaxis in a pregnant woman.\nDoxycycline and primaquine are not recommended for use in pregnancy. Artemether–lumefantrine is only\nrecommended for the treatment, not prophylaxis, of malaria.\n1825\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1826 ---\n\n47\nAnthelmintic Drugs\nJonathan C. Cho and Marylee V. Worley\n1826\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1827 ---\n\nI.  Overview\nNematodes, trematodes, and cestodes are three major groups of helminths (worms) that infect humans. Anthelmintic\ndrugs (Figure 47.1) are aimed at metabolic targets that are present in the parasite but either are absent from or have\ndifferent characteristics than those of the host. Figure 47.2 illustrates the high incidence of helmintic infections\nworldwide. Most anthelmintics target eliminating the organisms from the host, as well as controlling spread of\ninfections.\nFigure 47.1 Summary of anthelmintic agents.\n1827\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1828 ---\n\nFigure 47.2 Relative incidence of helminth infections worldwide.\n1828\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1829 ---\n\nII.  Drugs for the Treatment of Nematodes\nNematodes are elongated roundworms that possess a complete digestive system. They cause infections of the\nintestine as well as the blood and tissues.\n1829\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1830 ---\n\nA.  Mebendazole\nMebendazole [me-BEN-da-zole], a synthetic benzimidazole compound, is a first-line agent for the treatment of\ninfections caused by whipworms (Trichuris trichiura ), pinworms (Enterobius vermicularis ), hookworms (Necator\namericanus  and Ancylostoma duodenale ), and roundworms (Ascaris lumbricoides ). Mebendazole, and\nbenzimidazoles as a class, act by binding to parasite β-tubulin and inhibiting microtubule polymerization in the\nparasite. Affected parasites are expelled in the feces. Adverse effects include abdominal pain and diarrhea.\nMebendazole should not be used in pregnant women. [Note: Many anthelmintics should be avoided in pregnancy\n(Figure 47.3); however, in mass prevention or treatment programs, certain agents (for example, mebendazole or\nalbendazole) may be used in the second or third trimester.]\nFigure 47.3 Albendazole, ivermectin, mebendazole, and thiabendazole should be avoided\nin pregnancy.\n1830\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1831 ---\n\nB.  Pyrantel pamoate\nPyrantel pamoate [pi-RAN-tel PAM-oh-ate] is also effective in the treatment of infections caused by roundworms,\npinworms, and hookworms (Figure 47.4). Pyrantel pamoate is poorly absorbed after oral administration and is only\neffective against intestinal infections. It acts as a depolarizing, neuromuscular-blocking agent, causing release of\nacetylcholine and inhibition of cholinesterase, leading to paralysis of the worm and subsequent expulsion. Adverse\neffects are mild and include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\nFigure 47.4 Characteristics of and therapy for commonly encountered nematode\ninfections.\n1831\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1832 ---\n\nC.  Thiabendazole\nThiabendazole [thye-a-BEN-da-zole], a synthetic benzimidazole, is a potent broad-spectrum anthelmintic agent.\nCurrent use of thiabendazole is limited to the topical treatment of cutaneous larva migrans (creeping eruption).\nBecause of its toxic effects and removal from the market in many countries, it has been largely replaced by other\nagents.\n1832\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1833 ---\n\nD.  Ivermectin\nIvermectin [eye-ver-MEK-tin] is the drug of choice for the treatment of cutaneous larva migrans, strongyloidiasis,\nand onchocerciasis (river blindness, although not curative due to lack of activity in adult worms). [Note: Ivermectin\nis also useful in the treatment of pediculosis (lice) and scabies.] Ivermectin targets the glutamate-gated chloride\nchannel receptors. Chloride influx is enhanced, and hyperpolarization occurs, resulting in paralysis and death of the\nworm. The drug is given orally and does not readily cross the blood–brain barrier. Ivermectin should not be used in\npregnancy (see Figure 47.3). The killing of the microfilaria in onchocerciasis can result in a dangerous Mazzotti\nreaction (fever, headache, dizziness, somnolence, and hypotension). The severity of this reaction is related to\nparasite load. Antihistamines or steroids may be given to ameliorate the symptoms.\n1833\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1834 ---\n\nE.  Diethylcarbamazine\nDiethylcarbamazine [dye-eth-il-kar-BAM-a-zeen] is the drug of choice for filariasis caused by infection with\nWuchereria bancrofti , Brugia malayi,  or Brugia timori . It kills the microfilariae and has activity against adult worms.\n[Note: In countries where filariasis is endemic, a combination of antifilarial drugs (either diethylcarbamazine and\nalbendazole or ivermectin and albendazole) may be used annually as preventive chemotherapy.]\nDiethylcarbamazine is rapidly absorbed following oral administration with meals and is excreted mainly in the\nurine. Adverse effects may include fever, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, and headache. [Note: Patients suspected of\nhaving onchocerciasis should be given ivermectin and albendazole because diethylcarbamazine can accelerate\nblindness and cause severe Mazzotti reactions.]\n1834\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1835 ---\n\nIII.  Drugs for the Treatment of Trematodes\nThe trematodes (flukes) are leaf-shaped flatworms that are generally characterized by the tissues they infect (for\nexample, liver, lung, intestinal, or blood; Figure 47.5).\nFigure 47.5 Characteristics of and therapy for commonly encountered trematode\ninfections. GI = gastrointestinal.\n1835\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1836 ---\n\nA.  Praziquantel\nPraziquantel  [pray-zi-KWON-tel] is an agent of choice for the treatment of all forms of schistosomiasis, other\ntrematode infections, and cestode infections such as taeniasis. Praziquantel  causes contracture and paralysis of\nparasites by increasing the permeability of the cell membrane to calcium. It is rapidly absorbed after oral\nadministration and should be taken with food. The drug is extensively metabolized, and the inactive metabolites are\nexcreted primarily in the urine. Common adverse effects include dizziness, malaise, and headache as well as\ngastrointestinal upset. Dexamethasone, phenytoin, rifampin, and carbamazepine may increase the metabolism of\npraziquantel . Cimetidine causes increased praziquantel  levels. Praziquantel  is contraindicated for the treatment of\nocular cysticercosis, because destruction of the organism in the eye may cause irreversible damage.\n1836\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1837 ---\n\nIV.  Drugs for the Treatment of Cestodes\nThe cestodes, or “true tapeworms,” typically have a flat, segmented body and attach to the host’s intestine ( Figure\n47.6). Like the trematodes, the tapeworms lack a mouth and a digestive tract throughout their life cycle.\nFigure 47.6 Characteristics of and therapy for commonly encountered cestode infections.\nCT = computed tomography.\n1837\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1838 ---\n\nA.  Niclosamide\nNiclosamide [ni-KLOE-sa-mide] (no longer available in the United States) is an alternative to praziquantel  for the\ntreatment of taeniasis, diphyllobothriasis, and other cestode infections. It inhibits the mitochondrial phosphorylation\nof adenosine diphosphate (ADP) in the parasite, making it lethal for the cestode’s scolex and segments but not for\nthe ova. A laxative is administered prior to oral administration to purge the bowel of all dead segments and to\nenhance digestion and liberation of the ova. Alcohol should be avoided within 1 day of niclosamide use.\n1838\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1839 ---\n\nB.  Albendazole\nAlbendazole [al-BEN-da-zole], another benzimidazole, inhibits microtubule synthesis and glucose uptake in\nnematodes and is effective against most nematodes known. Its primary therapeutic application, however, is in the\ntreatment of cestodal infestations, such as cysticercosis and hydatid disease (caused by larval stage of Echinococcusgranulosus ). [Note: Albendazole is also very effective in treating microsporidiosis, a fungal infection.] Albendazole\nis erratically absorbed after oral administration, but absorption is enhanced by a high-fat meal. It undergoes\nextensive first-pass metabolism in the liver, including formation of an active sulfoxide, and its metabolites are\nprimarily excreted in the bile. When used in short-course therapy (1 to 3 days) for nematodal infestations, adverse\neffects are mild and transient and include headache and nausea. Treatment of hydatid disease (3 months) has a risk\nof hepatotoxicity and, rarely, agranulocytosis or pancytopenia. Medical treatment of neurocysticercosis is associated\nwith inflammatory responses to dying parasites in the central nervous system (CNS), including headache, vomiting,\nfever, and seizures.\n1839\nwww.webofpharma.com\n\n--- PAGE 1840 ---\n\n47.1\n47.2\n47.3\n47.4\n47.5\n47.6\n47.7Study Questions\nChoose the ONE best answer.\nA 32-year-old man is diagnosed with whipworm disease after he spent the summer working outside without\nshoes. Which would be the best treatment option?\nA.  Pyrantel pamoate\nB.  Mebendazole\nC.  Thiabendazole\nD.  Diethylcarbamazine\nCorrect answer = B.
