 INTRODUCTION 	
First Aid is just that – the immediate attention and treatment given when someone suffers an injury or 
sudden illness. In some cases the injury or illness will be min or and common sense and basic treat-
ment will be all that are needed. Never forget that staying cal m and being sympathetic and reassuring 
form part of the treatment, even  for minor childhood cuts and g razes. 
 
There are, however, accidents and illnesses that are serious, e ven life-threatening. In these cases you 
have only a few minutes in which  to act to prevent permanent di sability, brain damage or even death. 
Life-saving techniques such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (C PR) are explained at the beginning of 
t h i s  b o o k ,  b u t  i t  i s  v i t a l  t h a t  y o u  s t u d y  t h e s e  p r o c e d u r e s  u n d e r a qualified instructor, using an ap-
proved resuscitation training manikin. Resuscitation techniques  can be mastered by everyone, but 
they are skills for which practice is essential. If you’ve prac ticed with an expert instructor you will be 
able to act instantly, confidently and effectively in an emerge ncy, and this may well mean the differ-
ence between life and death for the casualty. 
 Accidents can be prevented. Because so many accidents occur in the home, we have included a chap-
ter on family safety so that you can make your home safer. And because of the frequency of road acci-
d ents , we have also in clu ded  inform atio n on  wh at to  d o at th e s cene of a traffic accident. But, once 
again, prevent accidents by, for example, obeying the speed and  alcohol limitations and driving safely. 
You could save your own life, as well as someone else’s.

 HOW	TO	USE	THIS	First	Aid	BOOK	
Vital First Aid is designed to be as simple and accessible as p ossible. You will find the step-by-step in-
structions throughout and the A to Z listing of accidents and s udden illnesses in the second section 
make it easy to follow, even in an emergency. 
 
The first section of the book (Emergency, First Aid  and Safety Procedures) provides essential infor-
mation on treating medical emergencies, such as unconsciousness , absence of breathing and blood 
circulation failure. A chapter on ROAD	TRAFFIC 	ACCIDENTS  is included in this section. The first part 
of the book also offers information on FAMILY	SAFETY  and on the articles you should have at hand in 
case of accidents or sudden illnesses and how to apply these. Y ou should read the first section now so 
that you know where to find essential information in an emergen cy and to familiarise yourself with 
first aid procedures. 
The second section of the book (A to Z of Injuries and Illnesse s) provides chapters, organised alpha-
betically for easy reference, on the most common major and mino r sudden medical occurrences that 
you may have to deal with.

 EMERGENCY, 	FIRST	AID	&	SAFETY	
PROCEDURES 	
WHAT	TO	DO	BEFORE	AN	EMERGENCY 	
● Read carefully all the information on first aid techniques giv en in this book, now, before an ac-
cident or sudden serious illness occurs. Don’t wait for an emer gency. 
● Learn how to apply cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (see EM ERGENCY TECHNIQUES): 
they are life-saving techniques. It is essential to practise wi th a trained instructor because only prac-
tice will give you the confidence and ability to act instantly and correctly in the vital few minutes that 
can mean the difference between  
life and death.  ● Make sure that you have a well-equipped first aid kit at home,  in the car and boat, and on holi-
days (see FIRST AID KITS). 
EMERGENCY 	PRIORITIES 	
A person’s life is in danger if he or she is unconscious. The a irway may be blocked, breathing may have 
stopped and blood circulation may have ceased. 
You need to: ● act immediately because brain da mage or death can quickly resu lt 
● carry out the procedures outlined in the DRSABCD in the order given 
● f o l l o w  t h e  i n s t r u c t i o n s  g i v e n  i n  t h e  n e x t  c h a p t e r ,  E M E R G E N C Y  T ECHNIQUES, for each of the 
procedures mentioned in the DRSABCD . 
REMEMBER 	IN	AN	EMERGENCY 	
● Do	not app roach  a cas u alty unles s it is s af e t o  do so . Ch eck wh ethe r there is any danger for 
you, others or the injured person first. 
● Even though you will feel upset, it’s important to act as calm ly as possible and to reassure any 
casualties. 
● Every minute is vital. 
● Do	not move a casualty unless it is absolutely essential for safety ( see MOVING A CASUALTY). 
● Do	not leave a casualty alone. Send someone else for medical aid imme diately. However, if you 
are the only person present in an emergency and help is unlikel y to arrive you will have to go for aid 
yourself as soon as possible. Dial 000 in any capital city or t he emergency number listed in the phone 
book or booth. 
● Messages given to the emergency services should be brief: indi cate place, nature of the emer-
gency, number of people involved and nature and extent of injur ies or illness. 
● Do	not give anything to eat or drink.

EMERGENCY 	TECHNIQUES 	
CHECKING 	FOR	UNCONSCIOUSNESS 	
When the normal activity of the brain is interrupted, a person can become unconscious. 
An unconscious person is: 
● unable to respond normally t o simple questions or touch 
● unaware of danger and unable to protect himself or herself  
● unable, by coughing or swallowing, to clear the airway of sali va, blood, vomit or foreign matter, 
which can obstruct the air tubes. The tongue, which becomes flo ppy, can fall back and also block the 
throat. 	ACTION

they respond. If there is no response the person is unconscious .  D O  N O T  S H A K E  P A T I E N T S ,  E S P E -
CIALLY CHILDREN OR BABIES. 
2 Place the casualty in the side  position and check the airway,  breathing and pulse . 
3 If the unconscious person is breathing and has a pulse, maint ain him or her in the side position, 
ensuring the airway remains clear and open and frequently check ing breathing and pulse until medi-
cal aid arrives. 
SIDE	POSITION 	
(also known as lateral, recovery or stable side position) 
1 Kneel beside the casualty. 
2 Place the casualty’s far arm straight out, at right angles to  the body, and the near arm, bent at 
the elbow, across the chest, with the fingers close to the far shoulder tip. 
3 Bend the near leg up at right angles to the body.  
4 Holding the shoulder and hip that are near you, gently roll t he casualty onto his or her side. The 
top leg rests on the ground with its thigh at right angles and calf parallel to the straight leg. 
5 Rest the uppermost, bent arm a cross the elbow of the straight  arm. 
6 Unless the casualty is less than 1 year in age, gently tilt t he head backwards. The face should be 
turned slightly downwards to allow any fluid to drain from the mouth and the tongue to fall forward, 
away from the airway.

CLEARING 	AND	OPENING 	THE	AIRWAY	
The airway is the passage from the nose and mouth to the lungs,  by which air enters and leaves the 
lungs. If it is blocked breathin g will cease. Therefore it is e ssential to keep the airway clear and open. 
	
ACTION	
1 Place the casualty in the side position.  
2  G e n t l y  c h e c k  t h e  m o u t h  f o r  v o m i t ,  f o r e i g n  o b j e c t s  o r  
broke n tee t h  and  c lear th ese awa y wit h you r finge rs. Rem ove 
dentures only if they are broken or loose. 
3 Keep the airway open so that breathing can occur: gen-
tly tilt the casualty’s head back with one of your hands on the  
forehead and the point of the ch in supported with the other. 
CHECKING 	FOR	BREATHING 	
Breathing should be regular, quiet and easy. 
	ACTION	
1 Look for the rise and fall of the lower chest and abdomen. 
2  L i s t e n a nd  f ee l  f o r  a i r  e s c a p i ng  f r o m  t h e  n o se  a nd  m o u t h  by  p lacing your cheek close to the 
casualty’s face. 
3 If the casualty is not breathi ng, begin compressions then res cue breaths. 
GIVING	RESCUE	BREATHS 		
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation is the easiest, most successful me thod of rescue breaths. Mouth-to-nose 
resuscitation is used when there is a serious jaw injury or if the casualty has to be revived in water. 
Mouth-to-nose resuscitation is used for babies and small childr en when your mouth can cover both 
the mouth and the nose. Mouth-to-mask resuscitation used by a p erson trained in this technique 
avoids mouth-to-mouth contact if the casualty is thought to be suffering from a disease such as a hep-
a t i t i s  v i r u s  o r  H I V  ( h u m a n  i m m u n o d e f i c i e n c y  v i r u s )  t h a t  c a n  b e  transmitted to another person by 
blood or other body fluids. 
	
ACTION	
	Mouth‐to‐mouth	Resuscitation 		
1 Kneel beside the casualty. 
2 Place the casualty on his or her back. 
3 Tilt the head back gently, su pporting the jaw with your  
fingers. Do	not press on the throat. The casual ty’s mouth should only be partl y open. 
4 Pinch the casualty’s nose. Take a deep breath and place your m outh over the casualty’s, sealing 
off any opening.  
5 Keeping the casualty’s head tilted, give 2 breaths – enough to  slightly raise the chest. 
6 Commence compressions at recommended rate. 
7 W h e n  t h e  c a s u a l t y  i s  b r e a t h i n g  a g a i n ,  p l a c e  h i m  o r  h e r  i n  t h e  lateral position and check the 
airway, breathing and pulse frequently.

Mouth‐to‐nose	Resuscitation 	
1 Kneel beside the casualty. 
2 Place the casualty on his or her back, with the head tilted ba ck. 
3 Supporting the jaw with your fingers, close the casualty’s mou th and keep it closed, using your 
thumb on the lower lip. 
4 Take a deep breath. Open your mouth wide and place it over the  casualty’s nose, without com-
pressing the soft nostrils. 
5 Breathe into the casualty’s nose. 
6 Move your mouth away. Open the casualty’s lower lip with your thumb to allow exhalation. 
7 Continue as for Mouth-to-mouth Resuscitation. 
	
Mouth‐to‐mask	Resuscitation 	
1 Kneel at the top of the casualty’s head, facing the feet.  
2 Place the narrow end of the mask on the bridge of the casual-
ty’s nose. Use both of your hands, placed on either side of the  jaw, to 
keep the airway open and to hold the mask firmly in place, crea ting an 
airtight seal. 
3 Take a deep breath and blow through the mouthpiece of the 
mask. 
4 Remove your mouth to allow exhalation. 
5 Continue as for Mouth-to-mouth Resuscitation. 
	
Mouth‐and‐nose	Resuscitation 	(Babies	and	Children 	Under	8)	
1 After clearing the airway, lay the child on his or her back, w ith the 
head slightly tilted (or horizontal if he or she is under 1), a nd the jaw sup-
ported by your hand. 
2 Place your mouth over the child’s nose and slightly opened mou th. 
Puff gently, providing just enou gh air to make the child’s ches t rise. 
3 Continue as for Mouth-to-mouth Resuscitation. 
 
	
CARDIOPULMONARY 	RESUSCITATION 	(CPR)	
If a patient is in Cardiac Arrest it is essential that someone perform CPR on them if they are to have 
any chance of surviving. It maint ains an artificial circulation  until expert help arrives. 
CPR is very tiring and ideally sho uld be carried out by two peo ple to maintain th e correct rhythm. 
 
NB: Please refer to the inside cover of this book for further deta ils relating to CPR. It is recommended 
that you attend a CPR course to practice CPR techniques; howeve r any attempt at CPR is better than 
no attempt at all.

ANATOMY 	AND	PHYSIOLOGY 	
The human body is made up of several ‘systems’, each of these s y s t e m s  c a r r y  o u t  v e r y  s p e c i a l i s e d  
tasks but rely on all the other systems in order to continue to  function at maximum  efficiency. Damage 
to any one system will have an effect on all the other systems in some way. As humans we have 10 
systems: nervous,  
cardiovascular, respiratory, musculoskeletal, digestive, urinar y, endocrine, lymphatic, reproductive 
and integumentary. 
 
The nervous	system	comprises of the brain, spinal 
cord and nerves. As the brain regulates body func-
tions, it is easy to see that damage to the brain or 
the wires (nerves) that carry information to other 
parts of the body would have an extreme affect. This 
damage can occur if injury is sustained to areas such 
as the skull and spinal column.   
The cardiovascular 	system  comprises of the heart, 
blood vessels and blood. Arteries carry blood that is 
h i g h  i n  o x y g e n  a w a y  f r o m  t h e  h e a r t  a n d  t o  o t h e r  
body parts. The blood from an artery is pumped and 
as such if an artery is cut, the blood will very quickly b e  l o s t  e i t h e r  i n t e r n a l l y  o r  e x t e r n a l l y .  A l m o s t  o u r  
entire blood volume can be pumped through our heart 
every minute. The pulse of the blood being pumped 
can be felt in areas such as the neck, wrist and groin – 
knowledge of these points is essential when assessing 
o u r  p a t i e n t s .  A b s e n c e  o f  a  p u l s e  w i l l  n o r m a l l y  m e a n  
t h a t  t h e  p a t i e n t ’ s  h e a r t  i s  n o t  p u m p i n g .  L o c a t i n g  a  
pulse can sometimes be difficult, even for experts, so 
other factors need to be assessed such as the patient’s 
skin colour and warmth. Veins carry blood back to the 
heart; this blood is lower in oxygen.

Vital First Aid  Ph 1300 88 03 43 
 
15 
 
The respiratory 	system	comprises of the mouth, nose, trachea, larynx, bronchi, bronchi oles and the 
lungs. The main function of the respiratory system is to delive r essential oxygen to the blood and to 
remove carbon dioxide (a waste product from cells) from the blo od. For this exchange of gases to take 
place the patient must be breathing and 
have a clear airway, if this gas exchange 
does not take place the patient will 
begin to die.

The musculoskeletal 	system  c o m p r i s e s  o f  
bones, ligaments, tendons and muscles. This sys-
tem is responsible for support of the body, 
movement and protection of the internal organs. 
The spinal column is another part of this system, 
it provides essential support and protection for 
the spinal cord. The spines’ main function’s are to 
provide support for the upper body and to pro-

 The urinary	system  comprises of the kidneys, bladder and urinary tract. This syst em is used to re-
move waste products suspende d in fluid from the body.  
The endocrine 	system	controls body functions by the use of hormones. An example of t his is insulin – 
without insulin we cannot absorb sugar for use by certain cells . 
The lymphatic 	system  is like the bodies sewer system; it strains and assists the bo dy to remove tox-

The	reproductive 	system  is responsible for human reproduction.   Immediate, efficient first aid at a 
road accident is essential. The first few minutes are vital and  prompt action can prevent brain damage 
or loss of life from obstructed breathing, heart failure or sev ere bleeding. 
The digestive 	system	comprises of the oesophagus, stomach and intestines. The digest ive system is 
used to digest or absorb food into the body and cells.

 ROAD	TRAFFIC 	ACCIDENTS 	
Immediate, efficient first aid at a road traffic accident is es sential. The first few minutes are vital and 
prompt action can prevent brain damage or loss of life from obs tructed breathing, heart failure or se-
vere bleeding. 
	
ACTION	
Safety	Measures 	
1 Check it is safe to approach an d that everyone on the scene is  safe. 
2 Avoid danger from oncoming vehicles. Park your car between the  accident and traffic if neces-
sary. 
3 Turn on your hazard warning lights or flashing lights (and low -beam headlights at night). 
4 Place warning triangles and people, if possible, at a reasonab le distance either side of the acci-
dent to alert oncoming traffic. 
5 Turn off the ignition of any car involved, put on the hand bra k e and, if on a slope, chock the 
wheels. Do	not touch a car or casualties if th ey are in contact with live ele ctric cables: contact the elec-
tricity emergency service immediately. Do	not	right an overturned vehicle. 
6 Check for flammable liquids, suc h as petrol, have fire extingu ishers handy and do	not smoke. 
 
First	Aid	
1 Check if there are any casualties in the wreckage or by the s ide of the road. Do not smash a car 
window to get at a trapped casual ty unless he or she is protect ed. 
2 Do not move anyone unless he or she is in immediate danger. T ry to give a trapped casualty 
first aid on the spot: slide or tilt the car seat back if the s teering wheel or any other heavy object is 
compressing the chest; tilt the casualty’s head back and suppor t the jaw so that the airway remains 
open. If you must move someone, follow the instructions given i n the next chapter, MOVING A CASU-
ALTY. 
3 Assess the condition of the casualties. Remember: treat an un conscious person first and imme-
diately check the airway, breathing and circulation (see emerge ncy priorities and emergency tech-
niques), then stop any severe bleeding. 
4 Send for help immediately. Remember: do not leave a seriously  injured or unconscious casual-
ty, unless help is unlikely to come, and always give clear, bri ef instructions about the location and na-
ture of the accident (see emergency priorities).  
MOVING	A	CASUALTY 	
Do	not move an injured person unless there is immediate danger from f ire, oncoming traffic or toxic 
fumes, for example. It is best to apply first aid on the spot a nd wait for medical help to arrive. 
However, if you (and others) mu st move someone, remember to: 
 hold the casualty firmly but gently 
 take special care always to support the head, neck and spine, e specially if the casualty is un-
conscious. 
 carry out the move smoothly, without jerking the casualty.

you have no help. 
	
ACTION	
1 If there are no leg injuries: bend or 
crouch down at the casualty’s feet, grip the ankles firmly, lean backwards and gently begin to drag the casualty from danger. If 
there are leg injuries: grip the elbows or 
wrists firmly, lean backwards and gently 
begin to drag the casualty; do not drag the 
casualty by the clothing. 
2  As you move the casualty backwards, 
keep his or her body as level with the ground 
as possible. 
HUMAN	CRUTCH		
This is suitable for an injured adult who can move with some he lp. 
	
ACTION	
1 Stand beside the casualty on his or her injured side, unless t he arm, 
hand or shoulder is injured (in which case stand on the opposit e side). 
2 Place your arm around the casualty’s back and grasp the clothi ng on 
the far hip. 3 Bring the casualty’s arm around your neck, support him or her with 
your shoulder and hold the hand (unless it is seriously wounded  or bleed-
ing). 
4 Move forward slowly with the casualty, both taking the first s tep 
with the inside foot.

sure you: 
 label the kit ‘First Aid’ 
 use a container that is childproof and waterproof 
 replace items as they are used, do not keep medications for any  length of time and safely dis-
pose of a prescribed medicine once the course of treatment is c ompleted 
 tape a card, listing emergency phone numbers and the blood grou p, allergies and special medi-
cal problems of family m embers to the container 
 keep the kit handy but beyond the reach of children 
 keep this book close by the kit for quick reference.

 DRESSINGS, 	PADS	AND	BANDAGES 	
DRESSINGS 	
A dressing is a protective cover  placed over a wound, before it  is bandaged, to help: 
 control and absorb bleeding and discharge 
 relieve pain 
 prevent infection and further injury. 
 A variety of sterile, non-adhesive dressings can be bought, but  any clean, absorbent material that does 
not stick, such as cotton, l inen or gauze, is suitable. 
 Do	not	apply cotton wool or fluffy material directly to a wound, becau se the fibres will stick. 
 Do	not touch the wound or any part of the dressing that will be in co ntact with the wound. 
Pads	
Pads, made from layers of cloth, gauze or bandages, are sometim es p laced o ver a dressi ng to app ly 
pressure, increase the absorption of fluids or help protect ski n. 
Ring	Pad	
A ring pad holds a bandage away from a wound if 
there is an object embedded in the wound or a broken 
bone protruding through the skin. However, a stand-
a r d  d r e s s i n g  p l a c e d  a r o u n d  t h e  o b j e c t  h a s  t h e  s a m e  
effect – but easier. To make a ring pad: wind one end of a narrow band-age around your fingers to make a loop, then bring the 
other end through the loop and pass it over and under until a firm ring has been made. 
BANDAGES 	
Bandages are used to: 
 control bleeding 
 keep dressings and pads in place 
 help reduce or prevent swelling 
 support a limb or jo int, relieving pain 
 restrict movement and, when used  with splints, immobilise a lim b or joint. 
Ready-made bandages, usually of calico, crepe or gauze, are ava ilable. Modern crepe, elastic or con-
f o r m i n g  b a n d a g e s  a r e  e a s y  t o  a p p l y ,  a n d  t h e y  m a i n t a i n  a n  e v e n  p ressure because they follow the 
b o d y ’ s  c o n t o u r s .  T h e y  a r e  a v a i l a b l e  i n  a  v a r i e t y  o f  w i d t h s  f o r  different parts of the body. Tubular 
gauze bandages are also easy to apply because they do not need to be tied and are available in sizes to 
fit different parts of the body; they are particularly useful f or fingers and toes. In an emergency you 
can, however, improvise, using a  sheet, pillowcase, stockings o r other materials for bandages. 
	
REMEMBER 	
Always check that bandages are not too tight. Swelling, palenes s or blueness of fingers or toes, numb-
ness, ‘pins and needles’, pain and lack of a pulse in the part of the body below the bandage area are 
indications that bandages should be loosened. Bandaging must be  checked regularly.

can be folded into wide or narrow bandages. 
T o  m a k e  a  n a r r o w  b a n d a g e  f r o m  a  t r i a n g u l a r  b a n d a g e :  f o l d  the point of the triangle over to meet the base edge, then fold  
the bandage over again. For a very narrow bandage, fold the 
bandage one more time. 
To make a pad from a folded triangular bandage: turn both 
ends in to meet at the middle, repeat the process and then 
fold one half of the layered bandage over the other.
 
 
	
Roller	Bandages 	
Traditionally these have been mad e of linen, cotton or gauze. T hey are applied as follows. 
1 Place yourself opposite the casualty. 
2 Support the injured limb. 
3 Hold the roll in one hand and bandage outwards from 
the casualty’s body, working from below the injury to above it. 
4 Overlap each turn by two-thirds and try to maintain 
even pressure. Finish with two or three turns above the 
wound. 
5 C u t  t h e  r o l l ,  t u c k  t h e  e n d  o f  t h e  b a n d a g e  u n d e r  a n d

 SLINGS	
The purpose of a sling is to support, protect or immobilise an injured limb. Ready-made slings may be 
bought, but they can also be made from a triangular bandage (se e dressings, pads and bandages), a 
towel, a pillowcase, a scarf or other materials. 
ARM	SLINGS		
An arm sling supports an injured arm (especially one with a spl int), such as a fractured forearm or 
wrist (see fractures). 
	
ACTION	
1 A s k  t h e  c a s u a l t y  t o  s u p p o r t  t h e  i n j u r e d  a r m ,  
holding the wrist and hand a little higher than the el-
b o w ,  w h i l e  y o u  p l a c e  a  t r i - a n g u l a r  b a n d a g e  b e t w e e n  
the arm and the chest, its point beyond the elbow. 
2 Take the top end of the triangular bandage over 
the shoulder on the uninjured side and around  
the neck. 3 Bring the point of the triangular bandage 
around the elbow and tuck it between the upper arm 
and the sling. 
4 Take the bottom end of the triangular bandage 
up over the hand and arm to meet the top end on the 
inured side. Tie the two ends in a reef knot (see dress-
ings, pads and bandages) in the hollow above the col-lar bone. Secure the sling at the elbow fold with a safe-ty pin. 
5 K e e p  t h e  c a s u a l t y ’ s  n a i l s  f r e e  a n d  c h e c k  t h e m  
regularly: if they are turning blue or white, loosen the 
sling a little.

 ELEVATION 	SLING	
This sling supports the elbow and prevents the arm from pulling  on an injured shoulder. It also sup-
ports a bleeding palm (see cuts and wounds), or a fractured han d (see fractures). 
	
ACTION	
1 P l a c e  t h e  f o r e a r m  o f  t h e  c a s u a l t y ’ s  i n j u r e d  a r m  a c r o s s  t h e  
chest, with the fingers close to the shoulder on the injured si de. 
2 Position a triangular bandage over the forearm and hand, its 
point towards the bent elbow. Put the top end of the triangular  
bandage over the casualty’s uninjured shoulder and let the base  
hang down in line with the body. 
3 Hold the casualty’s hand and the top end of the triangular 
bandage over the uninjured shoulder and tuck the triangular ban d-
age under the casualty’s hand and wrist, with your thumb. 
4 W i t h  y o u r  o t h e r  h a n d ,  
tuck the point of the triangular 
b a n d a g e  f i r m l y  u n d e r  t h e  c a s -
ualty’s upper arm. Next, sweep 
the same hand under the part 
of the triangular bandage still 
hanging down, and bring it up 
under the upper arm, tucking in the folds. 
5 Bring the end across the casualty’s back and tie it and the 
other end in a reef knot in the hollow above the collar bone on  
the un-injured side. Secure the elbow fold with a safety pin. 
COLLAR‐AND‐CUFF	SLING	
This is a suitable sling if there is an upper arm fracture not close to the elbow or hand (but not wrist) 
injury (see fractures). A triangular bandage, roller bandage, b elt, tie or narrow scarf can be used. 
1 Make a clove hitch with the bandage: form two loops, one 
pointing towards you and one away; bring the two loops togeth-
er. 2 Slip the clove hitch over the  wrist of the injured arm. 
3 Gently put the casualty’s forearm across the chest, with 
the  
fingers pointing to the shoulder in the most comfortable posi-
tion. 
4 Take the ends of the sling around the neck and tie them 
in a reef knot in the hollow above either collar bone.

SPLINTS	
Splints are used to protect wounds from further injury and to s upport or immobilise limbs in cases of 
a fractured upper or lower leg if medical aid will be delayed, or a fractured kneecap, upper arm close 
to the elbow, forearm, wrist or fin-
ger (see fractures). 
Prepared wooden splints can be 
bought, but in an emergency you 
can improvise with a furled um-
brella, rolled newspaper or any 
other rigid article. As well, an unin-
jured leg can be used as a splint by 
bandaging the injured leg to it; this 
method of splinting is used for a 
fractured neck of a thigh bone, and 
for a fractured upper or lower leg if medical aid will not be delayed. 
	
REMEMBER 	
 Move the injured limb as lit-
tle as possible while apply-
ing the splint. 
 The splint should be rigid and long enough to extend beyond the  joints on either side of the 
fracture. 
 Check bandages every 15 minutes to ensure blood circulation is not being restricted. 
 Common-sense should be used prior to deciding if a limb should be splinted by the rescuer. If 
advanced medical help is attending the scene and the limb is st able, it may be better that the 
rescuer waits and allow the advanced medical personnel to manag e the application of a splint 
and importantly provide suitable  pain relief before the applica tion of the splint. 
	
ACTION	
1 P a d  t h e  s p l i n t  w e l l  u s i n g  c l e a n  m a t e r i a l ,  f o l d e d  b a n d a g e s  o r  w hatever is at hand. Use extra 
padding between the splint and t he natural hollows and bony are as, such as ankles and wrists. 
2 Firmly tie the splint to the limb at the top and the bottom, u sing bandages. Do	not bandage di-
rectly over fractures.

 FAMILY	SAFETY	
The home is a dangerous place to be. Every year in Australia ab out 350 children die from accidents at 
home. Thousands more people, of all ages, are scarred or disabl ed for life. Elderly people as well as 
children are particularly prone to accident. 
The kitchen is the home’s most dangerous room. It is the place where family members usually spend 
the most time and where the most  accidents occur. Children are particularly at risk. They are naturally 
inquisitive and inclined to touch and try everything and to han g around your knees when you are 
cooking. The kitchen is a good place to keep your first aid kit  (see first aid). 
	
REMEMBER 	
There are many simple, easy measures you can take that will pre v e n t  a c c i d e n t s  h a p p e n i n g  t o  y o u r  
family. The following checklists will allow you to check the sa fety of your home and children and give 
you ideas for improving family safety. 
KITCHEN 	CHECKLIST 	
 A l l  a p p l i a n c e s  a n d  p o w e r  p o i n t s  a r e  w e l l  c l e a r  o f  c h i l d r e n ’ s  r e ach. Low power points have 
dummy plugs inserted. 
 The cords of electric appliances do not trail, especially near the sink or stove. 
 The plug of the electric kettle is always removed from the powe r point before the kettle is 
filled. 
 Filled teapots and hot drinks are kept well away from the edge of tables or benches, and hot 
drinks are never passed over a child’s head. 
 Knives are stored safely. 
 The iron is switched off as soon as it is finished with, and le ft in a safe place to cool down. 
 Matches and lighters are out of the reach of small children, an d older children have been taught 
their dangers and how to use them safely. 
 Tablecloths do not extend over the edges of tables if there is a baby or toddler around. 
 All cleaning products are kept out of the reach of children, pa rticularly dishwasher detergent, 
oven cleaner, bleach and corrosive chemicals. Under a sink is a  dangerous place to store them if 
you have children, unless the cu pboard is locked at all times. 
 Plastic bags are stored well out of the reach of children: suff ocation can take place quickly and 
silently. 
COOKING 	CHECKLIST 	
 Special care is taken when you are cooking with oil, which can spatter and burn a bystander or 
catch on fire (nearly half of all house fires start in the kitc hen). If a pan catches on fire, cover it 
with a lid or damp cloth. Leave it where it is until it cools d own. 
 Water is never poured into hot oil: the burst of steam resultin g can easily scald. 
 Food spilt on the floor is wiped  up immediately to avoid the fa mily slipping on it. 
 P o t s  a n d  p a n s  a r e  p l a c e d  o n  t h e  b a c k  b u r n e r s  w h e n e v e r  p o s s i b l e  and all handles are kept 
turned inwards. A stove safety g uard is a good investment if yo u have children. 
 C h i l d r e n  a r e  e n c o u r a g e d  t o  s t a y  w e l l  c l e a r  o f  t h e  s t o v e  w h e n  y o u are cooking. Take a few 
minutes, before you start, to give them something to do in a sa f e  a r e a:  f o r  e x a m p l e ,  r e a d i n g , 
games or drawing.

27 
 BATHROOM 	CHECKLIST 	
 All wiring in the bathroom is professionally fitted: water and electricity are a dangerous com-
bination. 
 The water’s temperature is always double checked before a baby or child is put in the bath. Al-
ways put the cold water in first. 
 Special care is taken if you use an electric shaver or hair dry er in the bathroom. It is better to 
use a hair dryer in the bedro om, well away from water. 
 A portable heater is not used in the bathroom. Have a safe heat er professionally installed. 
 No baby or child is every left alone in the bath. If you must a nswer the phone or door, wrap the 
child in a towel and take him or her with you. 
 Non-skid mats are used in the bath and shower, and there are sa fety rails for children or elder-
ly people to hold onto. 
 Medicines, the first aid kit, co smetics and perfumes are kept o ut of the reach of children. 
 Scissors, razor blades and electric shavers are also out of the  reach of children. 
 Everyone in the family know not to touch power points with wet hands: moisture is an excel-
lent conductor of electricity. 
 Toilet cleaner’s bleach and other cleaners are kept out of the reach of children. 
GARDEN	CHECKLIST 	
 Gloves are always worn when you are gardening. Spider bites can  bring on severe allergic reac-
tions (and some spiders are deadly). Gloves also help to preven t cuts from glass and rusty met-
al or nails. 
 Poisonous weed-killers and sprays are used as little as possibl e. There are efficient non-toxic 
and herbal products available. 
 All fertilisers, weed-killers and poisons are correctly labelle d and out of the reach of children. 
Do	not put chemicals in old food containers or soft drink bottles. 
 Garden tools, clippers, secateurs and other sharp items are sto red out of the reach of children. 
 Shoes (ideally sturdy ones) are worn when you are mowing or usi ng an electric garden appli-
ance, such as clippers. 
 Rubbish bins are kept well sealed so that children cannot rumma ge through them. 
 No child is ever left unattended near a swimming pool. Always e mpty wading pools after use 
and store them away. Remember:  a child can drown in centimetres of water. 
CHILD	SAFETY	CHECKLIST 	
Note that drowning is the most common cause of accidental death  in young children. Choking is an-
other common cause of death in children under five. Burns are a lso one of the most common acci-
dents. 
 No child under 3 is given peanuts. 
 No baby is left alone with food or drink: a baby can choke and die in minutes. 
 A dummy is not put around a baby’s neck on a long ribbon, which  can easily become entangled 
and cause strangulation. 
 No plastic bags are left lying around. Put them away immediatel y and teach children that they 
are not toys to play with. 
 All baby equipment is safe and conforms to approved safety stan dards. Take special care when 
purchasing cots, high-chairs, playpens, prams and strollers. 
 A child in a high-chair is always supervised. 
 A safety guard is placed around a fire or radiator.

  A baby capsule or child’s car seat, approved by the Standards A ssociation is always used and 
always	correctly 	fitted , and safety harnesses and seat belts are correctly 	adjusted 	every	
time  you take a baby or child in your car. 
 A baby is never kept in a car on a hot day. 
 A baby or child is never left unattended in a car. 
 Your child has been taught about road safety. Every time you cr oss the road, hold your child’s 
hand and explain the correct procedure. Whenever possible, cros s at a pedestrian crossing or 
traffic lights.

 PATIENT 	EXAMINATION 		
A good examination or assessment of a patient is essential if t he first aider is going to be able to treat 
the patient properly. It is very easy to get TUNNEL VISION, see ing the most obvious injury missing the 
less obvious.  
Following is the recommended tec hnique of patient assessment: 
 Check	your	priorities:  This stage of the assessment is probably the most important. I t is es-
sential that prior to performing any type of treatment or asses sment, the first aider must en-
sure a safe working environment – remove danger. The first aide r then completes the remain-
der of the DRSABCD. 
 Look	and	feel,	nose	to	toes:  starting with the head the first aider slowly and carefully as sess-
es each area of the body checking for cuts, abrasions, swelling , bruising or any other type of in-
jury. If at any stage an injury is found and thought to be life  threatening, the assessment should 
be stopped and the injury treated. This treatment should be kep t to a minimum at this stage to 
enable completion of the assessment. Full treatment of injuries  can be completed when the as-
sessment is finished. 
 Use	your	tools:  at this stage of the assessment the first aider uses additiona l resources such as 
bandages, slings pads etc to assist them in the treatment of th e patient. Tools that are also used 
are things such as the first aiders hands to assess the patient s basic temperature, the first aid-
ers eyes to assess the patients overall colour – these addition al tools are just as important as 
bandages and slings.  
 Take	an	ample	history:  it is important that a basic medical history be gained, time p ermitting, 
in order to be able to treat the patient appropriately. This hi story can also be passed onto other 
medical personnel such as the ambulance. Below is a suggested m ethod of remembering how 
to gain an adequate history.

P	 past	or	present	illnesses	
L	 last	meal	eaten	–	important 	for	the	hospital	to	know	in	case	surgery	is	required	
E	 events	leading	up	to	the	illness	or	accident  
CHECKING 	FOR	PULSE	
Checking for pulse is no longer required when performing CPR bu t can be used when assessing other 
aspects of a patient’s condition  (e.g. possible shock from majo r blood loss).  
The pulse rate is the rate of the heart beat: 60–80 strong, reg u l a r  b e a t s  p e r  m i n u t e  i s  n o r m a l  f o r  
adults, up to 100 for a child; and up to 140 for a baby. When t he heart stops beating, the blood in the 
body stops circulating. Breathin g will stop and the casualty wi ll be unconscious. 
	
ACTION	
Lightly place the tips of your middle two or three fingers on t he underside of the casualty’s wrist (to-
wards the thumb-side of the wrist). Count how many beats you fe el in one minute. If you are having 
difficulty finding the pulse, carefully move your fingers a lit tle further to either side of the wrist until 
you do feel the pulse.

 TEMPERATURE 	
The body’s temperature can vary during the day and can be affec ted by hot weather, physical exertion 
or hot food or drink; the normal range is 36.1°C to 37.1°C. 
Lowered or raised temperature can indicate illness or major inj ury. For example, low temperature can 
indicate SHOCK, heavy BLEEDING o r hypothermia; high temperature  can indicate severe infection or 
heat stroke (see HEAT EXHAUSTION AND HEAT STROKE). 
A mercury thermometer is the most common and accurate clinical thermometer. 
TAKING	THE	TEMPERATURE 	
1 Wash and dry the thermometer, then shake the mercury column d own until the reading is be-
low 36°C. 
2 Place the thermometer bulb under the tongue, under the arm or  in the groin. Leave it there for 
3 minutes before taking the reading. Babies and small children should have their temperature taken 
under the arm because they cannot hold the thermometer properly  in their mouth and may also bite 
it.  
ADMINISTRATION 	OF	MEDICATION 	
As first aiders we should not attempt to prescribe medication t o our patients; however we may find 
times when we are required to assist the patient with medicatio n. Only the patients’ medication 
should be made available to the patient – common- sense should p revail in times of emergency though. 
 
There are a couple of exceptions where suggesting or even provi ding medication to patients is ac-
ceptable: 
 Asthmatics who need Ventolin can be assisted with their medicat ion.  
 Patients who have severe allergies and carry an EpiPen may need  assistance in administration 
of the EpiPen 
 Patients with chest pain who are  not allergic to aspirin, can b e recommended to take 1 aspirin.  
If the first aider is at all unsure if it is appropriate to ass ist or administer any of theses medications, 
they should first consult with e ither the ambulance or a medica l practitioner.

 TRIAGE	
Triage means to sort. In first aid we use triage to determine w hich patient or injury we should treat 
first. Even in very minor emergency situations the first aider w ill fi nd th emsel ves tr iag ing  their p a-
tient. The table on the next page shows the type of system that  is used by major ambulance services 
and hospitals.  
 
 
COMMUNICATION 	
Communication with emergency services during an emergency is es sential, however it should be kept 
brief and to the point. It should state facts, not what you thi nk could or might have happened, and it 
should not interfere with the treatment of the patient. Communi cation should include the injuries 
found, pulse, skin colour, general condition, conscious state a nd other relevant information you feel is 
required. The emergency services are looking for trends in the patient’s condition, not minute by mi-
nute details. 
 
 
REMOTE 	AREA	FIRST	AID	
When venturing into remote areas preparation is the key for sur vival. A well packed appropriate first 
aid kit should always be taken even if the trip is only a short  one. Preparation for a trip into remote 
areas should include 
 Assessment of predicte d weather conditions  
 Clothing 
 Ability to construct shelter 
 Ability to keep warm 
 Water supplies 
 Communication  
These are only a few things that should be considered, contact with National Parks or walking clubs 
etc should be sort prior to the trip for more detailed suggesti ons.

 A	TO	Z	OF	INJURIES 	&	ILLNESSES 	
ASTHMA 	ATTACK	
Asthma is the most common chronic childhood disease in Australi a. One in four children and one in 
ten adults have it. Any person who experiences persistent short ness of breath, wheeziness or cough 
may potentially have asthma and should see a doctor. During an attack, the muscle surrounding the 
air tubes goes into spasm, the lining of the tubes becomes swol len and excessive mucus is produced, 
all of which results in the tube s narrowing, making breathing d ifficult. 
People with asthma should always carry medication to relieve an  attack. ‘Reliever’ medication is usu-
a l l y  i n  t h e  f o r m  o f  a  m e t e r e d - d o se, bronchodilator aerosol (‘pu ffer’), such as Ventolin, Bricanyl and 
Respolin. The delivery of aerosol medications is easier and mor e effective with a spacer device, par-
ticularly for children during an attack. 
	
Signs	and	Symptoms 	
 difficulty breathing 
 rapid, shallow breaths 
 noisy, wheezy breathing 
 coughing, particularly at night 
 feeling of tightness in the chest 
 difficulty speaking,  in severe attacks 
 blueness of lips and confusion, in very severe cases 
	WARNING 	
The seriousness of an attack is difficult to assess and varies,  but occasionally asthma is fatal, so 
prompt action should always be taken. 
 
If the person having an attack is not carrying medication, medi cal aid should be sought immediately: 
the quickest way to do this is to call an ambulance and state t hat a person is having an asthma attack. 
All ambulances are equipped to d eal with asthma in young childr en and others. 
	
ACTION	
1 Sit the person in a quiet, warm  place, away from other people and leaning on a table. 
2 Have the person take 4 puffs from his or her bronchodilator pu ffer, one after another (with a 
spacer if available). Using the recognised 4x4x4 emergency asth ma protocol 
3 Wait 4 minutes, then if there i s no improvement give 4 more pu ffs. 
4 If there is still no improvement or the person’s condition sud denly deteriorates, call an ambu-
lance immediately. 
5 While waiting for medical help to arrive, continue to administ er the puffer as described. 
Note	that	these	bronchodilator 	puffers	are	completely 	safe	
to	use	and	an	overdose	is	very	unlikely	during	
an	asthma	attack..	Oxygen	should	also	be	given	if	an	accredited 	person	is	there	to	do	so.

34 
 BITES	AND	STINGS	
Bites and stings can be poisonous or non-poisonous. Bites and s tings from venomous snakes, spiders 
and marine life need immediate emergency action. Among the most  dangerous of Australia’s fauna are 
the Taipan, tiger snake and death adder, the funnel-web and red -back spiders and the blue-ringed oc-
topus, cone shells, stonefish, b ullrout, box jellyfish and stin g-rays. 
Bites and stings from non-poisonous animals can sometimes also need medical attention. Stitches, an-
tibiotics or a tetanus injection may be required after an anima l bite. Some people suffer an allergic re-
action to what would normally be just a painful bit or sting: i n some cases the reaction is severe and 
must be treated immediatel y (see Bees and Wasps). 
NON‐VENOMOUS 	ANIMALS 	
	
ACTION	
1 Wash the wound thoroughly with a mild antiseptic or soap and w ater. 
2 Cover the wound with a clean dr essing and bandage (see dressin gs, pads and bandages). 
3 Seek medical aid, unless the wound is superficial, because ant i b i o t i c s  o r  s t i t c h e s  m a y  b e  r e -
quired. The sufferer may also require a tetanus injection unles s one has recently been administered. 
SNAKES	
Do	not w a s t e  t i m e  t r y i n g  t o  i d e n t i f y  t h e  s n a k e .  A p p l y  f i r s t  a i d  i m m e d iately. Unconsciousness and 
breathing difficulties can de velop quickly in a child. 
	
Signs	and	Symptoms 	
 puncture marks on the skin may be apparent, but the following o ther signs and symptoms may 
take from 15 minutes to 2 hours to appear 
 redness and swelling of the bitten area 
 nausea and vomiting 
 diarrhoea 
 headache 
 double vision 
 faintness 
 tightness in the chest and difficulty breathing 
 unconsciousness 
	WARNING 	
 Do not cut or cauterise the snake bite or attempt to suck out t he venom. 
 Do not apply a tourniquet or restrictive bandage. 
 Do not wash venom off the skin – it can help experts to identif y the snake type. 
	ACTION	
1 Lay the casualty down comfortab ly and try to keep him or her s till. Do not elevate a bitten limb. 
2 Apply pressure immobilisation . 
3 If the casualty becomes unconscious, place him or her in the  
lateral position, check the airway, breathing and pulse and beg i n  C P R  i f  n e c e s s a r y  ( s e e  e m e r g e n c y  
techniques). 
4 Seek medical aid urgently.

 PRESSURE 	IMMOBILISATION 	Bandage 	
Pressure immobilisation helps prevent venom reaching the bloods tream. It is useful for treating snake 
bite and most other bites and stings except	poisoning by red-back, jelly fish stings and venomous fish 
such as stonefish and bullrout. 
1 Apply pressure to the bitten area with your hands. 
2 As soon as possible apply a firm bandage: crepe is ideal, but you can improvise with, for exam-
ple, a stocking. Bandage over the bite then continue the bandag e up the limb. For bites to the torso the 
application of direct pressure 
t o  t h e  b i t e  s i t e  a p p e a r s  t o  b e  
the best treatment. 
3 I m m o b i l i s e  t h e  l i m b ,  
using a splint (see splints) if 
the leg has been bitten or a 
sling (see SLINGS) if the arm is 
affected. 4 Rest the casualty, and 
do	not	move him or her un-
less absolutely essential. It is 
preferable to wait for medical 
help to arrive. 
FUNNEL‐WEB	SPIDER	
The funnel-web, found mainly in Sydney and the coastal region o f New South Wales, is a large, black 
or reddish brown, hairy spider. The male is more poisonous than  the female and somewhat smaller 
and more slender, with a body le ngth of about 3 cm. An antiveno m is available. 
	
Signs	and	Symptoms 	
 intense pain around the bite 
 nausea and abdominal pain 
 numbness 
 weakness 
 difficulty breathing 
 coughing up of secretions 
 watery eyes 
 sweating, cold skin 
 shivering 
	
ACTION	
1 Treat as for bites from Snakes. 
2 Seek urgent medical help: thi s venom is life-threatening.

RED‐BACK	SPIDER	
The red-back is about the size of a pea and usually black with a reddish stripe on the back. Only the 
female is dangerous. An antivenom is available. 
	
Signs	and	Symptoms 	
 immediate, sharp, stinging sensations, sometimes 
 pain around the bite 
 swelling and sweating around the bite 
 SHOCK 
	
WARNING 	
Do not apply pressure immobilisation. 
	
ACTION	
1 Apply an ice pack or cold compress to the bite to ease the pai n (see SPRAINS AND LACERA-
TIONS). Do	not freeze the skin. 
2 Seek medical aid urgently. 
3 Monitor the casualty for shock. 
PARALYSIS 	(BUSH)	TICK	
These are most commonly found along the eastern coast of Austra lia, from Queensland to northern 
Tasmania. The small (only 0.25–0 .5 cm across), oval-shaped, dun g-coloured creature buries its head 
under the victim’s skin. The venom can cause paralysis, especia lly in children, but usually results in 
skin irritation or nodules. The tick should be removed as soon as possible. 
	
Signs	and	Symptoms 	
 irritation at the site of the bite 
 weakness of the face and eyelids, then arms 
 breathing becomes difficult 
	
ACTION	
1 the preferred method is to rapi dly freeze the tick by using a product such as “Tick OFF’ which is 
available from most chemists. The key is to kill the tick rapid ly which helps to reduce the toxins being 
released. Do not pinch or squeez e the tick. Do not try to pull the tick off. 
2 Check carefully that there are no other ticks in the crevices of the sufferer’s body, such as be-
hind the ears, or in the hair. 
3 If the symptoms persist or if a child has been bitten, seek me dical aid immediately. 
BEES	AND	WASPS	
Some people suffer allergic react ions to the stings of bees and  wasps. 
	Signs	and	Symptoms 	of	Allergic	Reaction 	
 local pain, swelling and itchiness 
 itchy rash on the body 
 puffy eyelids and face 
 constricted throat and difficulty breathing

ACTION	
1 If a bee sting is involved, remove the sting by brushing it si deways with your fingernail or a 
knife blade. Do	not squeeze the poison sac by pulling out the barb. 
2 Wipe the area and apply a cold compress. 
3 If there is an allergic reaction, the casualty should immediat ely take any medication for allergy

breathing, begin CPR if necessa ry (see EMERGENCY TECHNIQUES) an d seek medical aid urgently. 
BLUE‐RINGED	OCTOPUS 	AND	CONE	SHELLS	
Blue-ringed octopus are found in rock pools all along the Austr alian coastline. They are small (no 
more than 20 cm from tip to tip when their tentacles are spread  out) and their bite is often painless, 
but the venom is potent and affects the victim rapidly. Because  of their size and attractiveness, chil-
dren may be tempted to pick them up and should be warned not to  put their fingers in the crevices of 
rock pools. No antivenom is available.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The majority of cone shell species are found along the tropical  northern Australian coastline, but some 
are also found in temperate wate rs. All species are poisonous, and the sting of some is lethal. 
	
Signs	and	Symptoms 	
 blurred vision 
 numbness of lips and tongue 
 difficulty swallowing 
 absence of breathing 
	
ACTION	
1 Apply pressure immobilisation . 
2 Send for urgent medical aid, but do	not	leave the casualty unattended. 
3 As soon as breathing is affected, begin CPR (see EMERGENCY TEC HNIQUES) and continue until 
medical help arrives.

 BLEEDING 	
Severe or continued bleeding, if not controlled, is potentially  fatal. It is critical to stop the bleeding as 
quickly as possible. 
Internal bleeding can occur after a serious accident or heavy f all or result from a medical condition, 
such as a stomach ulcer. Bleeding into the tissues and cavities  of the body can be life-threatening and 
immediate hospital care is essential. 
EXTERNAL 	BLEEDING 	
	
Signs	and	Symptoms 	
 bleeding from a wound 
 SHOCK 
	ACTION	
1 Lay the casualty down (unless there are 
CHEST INJURIES). 
2 Check that the wound does not contain a 
foreign body or protruding bone (see FRACTURES). 
I f  i t  d o e s ,  d o  n o t  d i s t u r b  i t ,  b u t  a p p l y  a  r i n g  p a d  
(see DRESSINGS, PADS AND BANDAGES). 3 If the wound is clear of protruding matter, 
apply direct pressure immediately to it: when no 
sterile or improvised dressing is available, use your hands to control bleeding until you can add a 
clean dressing and pad. If the patient is able to apply the pre ssure himself or herself, this is recom-
mended to reduce the ris ks of cross-infection. 
 4 Bandage the wound firmly. If it is on an arm or leg and there are no obvious fractures, raise the 
limb. 
5 If blood seeps through the bandage, leave the dressing in plac e but replace the pad. Do	not re-
move the dressing, pad or ban dage when bleeding stops. 
6 Do	not give anything to eat or drink. 
7 Monitor the casualty for shock. 
8 Seek medical aid urgently. 
 
  
To	stop	bleeding	from	the	palm,	which	can	be	severe:	get	the	casu‐
alty	to	grip	a	pad	in	the	palm	to	apply	pressure	to	the	wound;	ele‐
vate	the	hand,	leaving	one	end	at	the	base	of	the	thumb,	take	a	
bandage	around	the	hand,	down	over	the	fist	and	around	and	over	
the	thumb	and	end	of	bandage: 	continue	bandaging 	in	this	way,	
then	tie	both	ends	at	the	top	of	the	fist;	finally,	rest	the	bandaged 	
hand	against	the	shoulder	on	the	uninjured 	side	and	support	it	
with	an	elevation 	sling	(see	SLING).

 INTERNAL 	BLEEDING 	
	
Signs	and	Symptoms 	
 coughing up or vomiting of blood 
 passing of black or red faeces 
 passing of red or smoky urine 
 pain, tenderness and muscle rigidity of the abdomen 
 SHOCK 
	
ACTION	
1 Lay the casualty down comfortably and loosen any tight clothi ng. 
2 Raise or bend the legs (unless there are suspected FRACTURES) . 
3 Seek medical aid urgently. 
4 Monitor the casualty for shock. Do	not give any food or drink. 
BRUISES 	
A heavy fall or blow can cause  bleeding beneath the skin. 
	Signs	and	Symptoms 	
 pain 
 bruise, which turns from red to bluish purple to greenish yello w 
 swelling 
 tenderness 
 
  
	
ACTION	
1 Check for injuries, particular ly FRACTURES, SPRAINS AND DISLO CATIONS or STRAINS. 
2 Rest the casualty, support the injured part and apply a compr ession bandage. A heavily bruised 
arm should be supported with a sling (see SLINGS). If the legs or body are bruised, support them with 
cushions. 
3 Apply an ice pack (see SP RAINS AND DISLOCATIONS).

 BURNS	AND	SCALDS	
Burns are caused by the dry heat from flames, electricity, ligh tning, chemicals and 
radiation (for example, in sunburn). Scalds are caused by moist  heat from boiling 
liquids or steam. Burns and scalds are serious injuries and can  result in infection, 
scarring and, in extreme cases, death. 
	
Signs	and	Symptoms 	
 skin looks red and blistered if only the outer layers are affec ted 
 skin looks dark red, blackened or charred if all the layers of skin are burnt 
 p a i n  i f  t h e  b u r n  o r  s c a l d  i s  s u p e r f i c i a l ,  b u t  i t  m a y  b e  a b s e n t  i f  n e r v e  e n d s  
have been damaged 
 SHOCK if burns or scalds are extensive. 
	
ACTION	
1	 Remove the casualty from danger and the source of heat if 
you can do so without becoming a casualty yourself (see MOVING 
A CASUALTY). 
2 If the casualty’s clothes are on fire, protect yourself by 
holding a blanket or rug in front of yourself as you approach h im 
or her. Wrap the blanket or rug around the casualty to smother the 
flames, and lay him or her on the ground. If you must use water  to 
put out the flames, do	not	throw it. 
3 If the casualty is unconscious, place him or her in the latera l 
position, check the airway, breathing and pulse and begin CPR i f 
necessary (see EMERGENCY TECHNIQUES). 
4 Carefully remove burnt clothing unless it is adhering to the s kin. 
5 Cool the burnt area with cold, but not icy, water, ideally by placing the burn under gently run-
ning water for at least 10 minutes. 
6 Cover the burn with a sterile, non-adherent dressing, 
t h e n  l i g h t l y  a p p l y  a  b a n d a g e  ( s e e  D R E S S I N G S ,  P A D S  A N D  
BANDAGES). Do	not	apply ointments, l otions or cream. 
7 If the casualty is conscious and thirsty, give him or her 
water to sip slowly. Do	not give alcohol. 
8 Rest the casualty comfortably, supporting any burnt 
limb. 
9 For all except minor burns and scalds, seek medical 
aid immediately.

 CHEST	INJURIES 	
The chest protects the heart, lungs and major blood vessels, so  injuries to this can quickly affect 
breathing and circulation and ma y result in profuse bleeding. 
Sometimes a fractured rib may pierce the lung, causing serious damage, internal bleeding or even the 
collapse of the lung. 
If a fractured rib or a sharp object has penetrated the chest w all, air from outside can be sucked di-
rectly into the chest cavity. Th is air can cause the lung on th e injured side to collapse. 
FRACTURED 	RIBS	
	
Signs	and	Symptoms 	
 pain, worsening wh en the casualty breathes or coughs 
 difficulty breathing 
 frothy blood coughed up, sometimes 
 tenderness in the injury area 
 
The main contents of the chest or thorax are: 
 lungs 
 heart 
 veins/arteries 
 nerves 
 ribs/sternum 
 trachea 
 bronchi 
 
This	diagram	shows	the	protection 	to	the	thorax	in	the	form	of	the	ribs	and	sternum	
	
ACTION	
1 If the casualty is unconscious, place him or her in the latera l position on the injured side, check 
the airway, breathing and pulse and begin CPR if necessary (see  EMERGENCY TECHNIQUES). 
2 Rest the conscious casualty in a half-sitting position, leanin g downwards on the injured side. 
3 Pad the injured side, then bandage the upper arm and padding t o the injured side (see DRESS-
INGS PADS AND BANDAGES). 
4 Immobilise the arm with an elev ation or collar- and-cuff sling (see SLINGS). 
5 Seek medical aid urgently. 
SUCKING 	WOUNDS 	
	
Signs	and	Symptoms 	
 pain in the area of the injury 
 blood bubbling from the wound 
 bluish lips

sary (see EMERGENCY TECHNIQUES). 
2 Rest the conscious casualty in a half-sitting po-
sition, leaning downwards on the injured side. 
3 Quickly remove the clothing around the 
wound and place your hand over the wound. 
4 Cover the wound with a sterile dressing (see 
DRESSINGS, PADS AND BANDAGES) or an airtight 
dressing made from plastic or aluminium foil. Tape 
the covering to the chest on three sides to prevent air entering, but do not tape the bottom edge, leave it 
open so that air under pressure can escape. 
5 Seek medical aid urgently. 
 
 
  
CHOKING 	
A piece of food, fishbone or other object can lodge in the airw ay, obstructing breathing. Young chil-
dren can choke on a peanut or a part of a toy. Choking is poten tially fatal and immediate first aid is es-
sential. 
PARTIALLY 	BLOCKED 	AIRWAY	
	
Signs	and	Symptoms 	
 coughing 
 difficulty breathing 
 blueness of the face, neck and extremities 
 unconsciousness, sometimes 
	
WARNING 	
If an adult, child or baby can cough, cry or walk do not slap h im or her on the back because this can 
cause the obstruction to shift a nd become a total blockage of t he airway. 
	
ACTION	
1 Place the unconscious, breathing casualty in the lateral posi tion, monitoring the airway, 
breathing and pulse (see EMERGENC Y TECHNIQUES) and seek medical  aid urgently. 
2 Encourage the conscious casualty to relax and allow him or he r to cough. If laboured breathing 
continues, seek medical aid urgently.

 COMPLETELY 	BLOCKED 	AIRWAY	
	
Signs	and	Symptoms 	
 inability to cough 
 inability to breathe 
 unconsciousness 
 the airway resists air and the chest fails to rise when rescue 
breaths are given 
	
ACTION	
1 Position the casualty so that the head is slightly lower than  
the chest. Support a baby’s chest and body across your knees. P lace 
a child head down across your knee, with the chest supported by  
one hand. 
2 Give 3–4 sharp slaps between the shoulder blades with your 
hand. 
3 If there is no improvement, give CPR (see EMERGENCY 
TECHNIQUES). 4 Seek medical aid urgently. 
CONCUSSION 	
A severe fall or blow to the hea d or face can shake the brain a nd cause concussion. 
	
Signs	and	Symptoms 	
 pale, clammy skin 
 shallow breathing 
 nausea, vomiting 
 dizziness 
 loss of consciousness, sometimes only momentary 
 loss of short-term memory 
 double vision 
 headache 
 SHOCK 
	ACTION	
1 Lay the casualty down in a com fortable position. Do not give any food or drink. 
2 Apply a cold compress to the knocked area. 3 Watch for any worsen ing of the condition. 
4 If the casualty loses consciousness, place him or her in the lateral position, check the airway, 
breathing and pulse and begin CPR if necessary (see EMERGENCY T ECHNIQUES). 
5 Seek medical advice: anyone who has lost consciousness becaus e of a blow, even if only briefly, 
should see a doctor.

 CONVULSIONS 	(OR	FITTING) 	
A convulsion is an episode in which normal brain activity becom es disturbed. It can be caused by a 
serious accident, DRUG OVE RDOSE, fever or epilepsy. 
Babies and young children, between the ages of 6 months and 6 y ears, can suffer seizure known as fe-
verish convulsions. Feverish convulsions without complications do not cause damage or result in epi-
lepsy. 
Epilepsy is a disorder that take s the form of recurring seizure s. The seizures occur as a result of a brief 
disturbance of electrochemical a ctivity in the brain. There are  many types of seizures. Major general-
ised (tonic-clonic) seizure is one common type of epileptic sei zure. Usually epileptic seizures are brief 
– lasting only a few seconds or minutes – and stop of their own  accord. Most involve a change in con-
sciousness. However, some seizures, such as the absence seizure , which is a brief staring episode, are 
subtle and may go undiagnosed for years. 
FEVERISH 	CONVULSIONS 	(Febrile	Convulsions) 	
	
Signs	and	Symptoms 	
The convulsion usually lasts onl y a few minutes and may involve : 
 jerking or twitching of the body 
 limpness of the body 
 difficulty breathing 
 Unconsciousness. 
	
ACTION	
1 Protect the child from injury by removing any dangerous objec ts, but do not forcibly restrain 
him or her. 
2 During the seizure, place the child in the lateral position a nd keep the airway clear (see EMER-
GENCY TECHNIQUES). 
3 Remove all the surplus clothing and allow air to reach the ch ild’s skin. Do not try to cool him or 
her with cold or tepid water bec ause this can cause the fever t o last longer. 
4 Seek medical aid before the TEMPERATURE rises again. 
5 The doctor may recommend givin g the child a medicine, such as  paracetamol to reduce the fe-
ver. 
6 Cover the child lightly once the temperature has been reduced . 
EPILEPSY 	
	
Signs	and	Symptoms 	of	Major	Generalised 	Seizure	
 person suddenly falls, rigid a nd unconscious, to the ground 
 body convulses or shakes 
 altered breathing pattern 
 frothing at the mouth, sometimes 
 loss of bladder control, sometimes 
 blood on the lips, sometimes, i f the tongue has been bitten 
 temporary confusion on recovering 
 need to sleep, afterwards 
 temporary confusion on wakening 
 
 

--- PAGE 48 ---

Vital First Aid  Ph 1300 88 03 43 
 
47 
 ACTION	
1 Stay calm and protect the person from injury by removing any dangerous objects but do not 
forcibly restrain him or her. 
2 Place something soft under the person’s head to protect it, a nd loosen any tight clothing. 
3 As the convulsions pass, place the person in the lateral posi tion and keep the airway clear (see 
EMERGENCY TECHNIQUES) but do not force anything into the mouth.  
4 Reassure the person as consciousness returns (usually after a  few minutes), and help him or 
her to somewhere nearby where he or she can rest or sleep. 
5 Seek medical aid if the seizure lasts longer than 10 minutes,  there are further seizures; or you 
feel unsure in the situation and it is possibly the first seizu re the person has experienced. 
CRAMP	
Cramp is a sudden and prolonged muscle contraction causing shar p pain. It may be caused by lack of 
body fluid (for example, after heavy vomiting or diarrhoea), po or circulation or strenuous exercise in 
extremely hot or c old conditions. 
	
ACTION	
1 Gently stretch and straighten the cramped muscle: for hand cr amp, get the sufferer to straight-
e n  t h e  f i n g e r s  a n d  p r e s s  d o w n  o n  t h e  t i p s ;  f o r  f o o t  o r  c a l f  c r a mp, have the sufferer stand, pushing 
down on the heel and toes; for thigh cramp, seat the person, st raighten the leg, lift the toes with one of 
your hands and press down on th e knee with your other one. 
2 If the cramp is due to loss of fluid, administer tepid water to which glucose or sugar has been 
added. 
CUTS	AND	WOUNDS 	
Minor cuts, scratches and abrasions do not usually require medi cal attention.  
Abrasions, such as gravel rash, may have dirt embedded in the w ound and are likely to become infect-
ed. 
A stab or penetrating wound is caused by a sharp object, such a s a knife, bullet, scissors, blade or nail. 
Although the surface cut may be small, such objects can penetra te deeply and harm internal organs. 
These objects may also carry dirt deep inside, increasing the r isk of infection. 
CUTS	AND	ABRASIONS 	
	
ACTION	
1 Wash your hands thoroughly  before treating the wound. 
2 Gently brush away any surface foreign object, such as gravel.  
3 Clean the wound and surrounding area, wiping away from the wo u n d ,  u s i n g  s t e r i l e  s w a b s ,  
warm sterile water and a little mild antiseptic. Pat the skin a round the wound dry. 
4 Apply a sterile, non-adherent dressing if necessary (see DRES SINGS, PADS AND BANDAGES). 
5 If the wound is dirty or cause d by a rusty object, a tetanus injection may be needed.

48 
 STAB	WOUNDS 	
	
ACTION	
1 Stop any BLEEDING by applying direct pressure. 
2 Cut away or remove the c lothing around the wound. 
3 Carefully cleanse the wound if it is not bleeding and apply a  sterile dressing (see DRESSINGS, 
PADS AND BANDAGES). 4 Seek medical aid. 
WOUND	WITH	EMBEDDED 	OBJECT	
	
ACTION	
1 Do not attempt to remove the ob ject. Apply a ring pad (see DR ESSINGS, PADS AND BANDAGES) 
or pad around the wound an d apply a clean dressing. 
2 Apply pressure around the obje ct to stop BLEEDING, but do not  apply pressure to the object 
3 Seek medical aid urgently. 
SEVERED 	LIMBS	
It may be possible to save a severed limb, finger or toe if you  act quickly. Your first priority, however, 
is to save the casualty’s life. 	WARNING 	
Do not attempt to bandage a severed limb in position. You will cause further distress and pain to the 
casualty and damage delicate ti ssues, hampering possible micro- surgery. 
	
ACTION	
1 Lay the casualty down, with th e injured part of the body supp orted in a raised position. 
2 Firmly press a large piece of gauze or clean cloth against th e stump or raw area to stop BLEED-
ING. Bandage the dressing in place. 3 Seek urgent medical aid. 
4 Encourage the casualty to stay as still as possible. Watch cl osely for any signs of SHOCK, which 
can be caused by the loss of blood. 
5 Find the severed limb. Do not wash it. Place it in a watertig ht container, such as an inflated and 
sealed plastic bag. Put the cont ainer in water to which, if pos sible, ice has been added, but do not allow 
the part to have direct contact with the ice. Send the containe r to hospital with the casualty.

 DIABETES 	
A person with diabetes has no insulin or insufficient amounts o f insulin, produced by the pancreas, to 
maintain a balanced blood sugar level. Diabetes can be treated by a special diet, by a special diet and 
oral hypoglycaemic agents (tablets), or by a special diet and i nsulin therapy. 
If a person with diabetes receives too much insulin or insuffic ient food while taking insulin, he or she 
can suffer from low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) and become unco nscious. If too little insulin is ob-
tained, a high blood sugar level (hyperglycaemia) can cause a d iabetic coma. However, a medical 
emergency is more likely to involve low blood sugar because hig h blood sugar usually develops over a 
greater length of time, so the person has more warning. 
LOW	BLOOD	SUGAR	‐	hypoglycaemia 		
	
Signs	and	Symptoms 	
 faintness, giddiness 
 hunger 
 pale, sweating skin 
 tingling around the mouth 
 rapid pulse 
 slurred speech 
 mental confusion and perhaps aggressive behaviour 
 weakness 
 unconsciousness 
	
ACTION	
1 If the person is unconscious do not give anything by mouth; p lace him or her in the lateral posi-
tion and check the airway, breathing and pulse (see EMERGENCY T ECHNIQUES). 
2 Seek medical help immediately. 
3 If the person is conscious, give him or her glucose in the fo rm of, for example, lemonade, or-
ange juice, a glass of water with at least 2 teaspoons of sugar  in it. 
4 Once the person feels better (usually a few minutes after hav ing the glucose), give him or her 
some complex carbohydrates, such as fruit or a sandwich. 5 Make sure the person discusses the possible causes of the hyp oglycaemic episode with his or 
her doctor so that it may be avoided in the future. 
HIGH	BLOOD	SUGAR	
	
Signs	and	Symptoms 	
 extreme thirst 
 need to urinate frequently 
 tiredness, sleepiness 
 dry, flushed skin 
 rapid pulse 
 blurred vision 
 nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain 
 breath has a sweetish acetone odour 
 unconsciousness 
  

--- PAGE 51 ---

Vital First Aid  Ph 1300 88 03 43 
 
50 
 ACTION	
1 If the person is unconscious place him or her in the lateral position, check the airway, breath-
ing and pulse and begin CPR if necessary (see EMERGENCY TECHNIQ UES). 
2 Seek medical aid urgently. 
DROWNING 	
As a person struggles to stay afloat, water can enter the airwa y, blocking the air supply. If breathing 
stops and the oxygen supply to t he brain is cut off, permanent brain damage or death can result. 
It is therefore vital to start rescue breaths as quickly as pos sible – as the person is being taken from 
the water if it is safe to do so. 
Prevent drowning by: 
 learning to swim 
 teaching your children to swim 
 not leaving children alone at a swimming pool or beach 
 learning basic rescue and resuscitation procedures. 
	WARNING 	
Do not attempt to rescue anyone in deep water if you are an ine xperienced swimmer. Instead, call for 
help immediately. 	
ACTION	
1 Check the airway, clearing it of vomit or any other obstructi on, and begin mouth-to-nose (see 
EMERGENCY TECHNIQUES) while comi ng ashore in shallow water if i t is safe to do so. Do not attempt 
resuscitation in deep water unle ss you have been trained to do so and have a flotation device. 
2 When the casualty is on firm ground, place him or her in the lateral position and check the air-
way again. 3 Start or resume CPR. 4 When the casualty starts breathing again, maintain him or her  in the lateral position, covered 
with a towel or blanket. 5  S e e k  m e d i c a l  a i d  i m m e d i a t e l y .  A n y  p e r s o n  w h o  h a s  l o s t  c o n s c i o usness or been resuscitated 
must go to hospital. 
6 Monitor the casualty’s breathing and pulse closely until medi cal help arrives because relapses 
often occur. 
DRUG	OVERDOSE 	
This may involve accidental overdose of a prescription medicine  or a potentially lethal dose of narcot-
ics. Urgent medical aid is needed. 
	Signs	and	Symptoms 	
 dizziness, faintness 
 convulsions 
 weak pulse 
 difficulty breathing 
 vomiting 
 loss of consciousness 
Note that signs and symptoms vary depending on the type and qua ntity of drug taken. 
 
 


--- PAGE 52 ---

Vital First Aid  Ph 1300 88 03 43 
 
51 
  
ACTION	
1 If the casualty is unconscious, place him or her in the later al position, check the airway, breath-
ing and pulse and begin CPR if necessary (see EMERGENCY TECHNIQ UES). If breathing and pulse are 
satisfactory, maintain the unconscious person in the lateral po sition and continue to monitor breath-
ing and pulse. 
2 If the casualty is conscious, treat as for POISONING, but do not induce vomiting unless instruct-
ed to do so by you Poisons Information Centre or a doctor. 
3 Try to establish which drug was taken, and send any container s, tablets or syringes to the hos-
pital with the casualty. Also se nd a sample of vomit, in a cove red jar. 
4 Seek medical aid urgently. 
EAR	INJURIES 	
BLEEDING 	
Bleeding from the ear can indicate a serious head injury, such as a fractured skull, which can be life-
threatening. 
	
ACTION	
1 Place the person in the lateral position (see EMERGENCY TECHN IQUES), with the injured ear 
tilted downwards on a clean dressing to help the fluid drain. D o not plug the ear or give drops. 
2 Seek medical help urgently. 
PERFORATED 	EARDRUM 	
The eardrum is a membrane, across the passage between the middl e and outer ear, essential to hear-
ing. A ruptured eardrum can be caused by pressure changes, a bl ow, explosions, a foreign agent or an 
infection. 
	
Signs	and	Symptoms 	
 severe pain 
 loss of hearing 
 blood or fluid flow 
	
ACTION	
As for Bleeding under EAR INJURIES. 
FOREIGN 	OBJECT	
Small objects, such as beads o r insects, can enter the ear. 
	
ACTION	
1 Do not probe the ear. Do not attempt to remove the object unl ess it is an insect. If the object is 
an insect, tilt the person’s head away from you and administer a drop of warm oil or water to the ear, 
then tilt the head towards you s o that the insect can float out . 
2 Seek medical help for any foreign object other than a trapped  insect. If a trapped insect does 
not float out, also seek medical aid.

ELECTRIC 	SHOCK	
An electric shock can cause a mild ‘pins and needles’ sensation  or can stop breathing and cause heart 
failure, resulting in death. 
 
Frayed or faulty wires, defective appliances and appliances use d near water are common but prevent-
able causes of electric shock in the home. 
	
WARNING 	
Before touching the victim make sure you are safe. Immediately turn off the current at the mains or 
power point and, if the accident  involves an appliance, pull ou t the plug. 
 
In the case of high-voltage electricity, involving, for example , electric train lines or heavy machinery, 
stay well clear, call for emergency help urgently and wait for trained personnel to disconnect the 
power. 
	ACTION	
1 If you cannot turn off the power, move the casualty away from  the source of electricity, using 
something dry and non-conducting, such as a wooden broom handle , a wooden chair or a rolled 
newspaper. Stand on a non-conducting surface, (for example a dr y rubber mat or a newspaper) while 
you do this. 
2 When the casualty is clear, smother the flames of any burning  clothing (see BURNS AND 
SCALDS). 3 If the casualty is conscious, place him or her in the lateral  position, check the airway, breathing 
and pulse and begin rescue breaths or CPR if necessary (see EME RGENCY TECHNIQUES). 
4 Treat any burns. 
5 Seek medical aid. 
EYE	INJURIES 	
The eye is extremely sensitive, delicate and susceptible 
to infection, so all injuries are potentially serious. Medi-cal help should be sought as soon as possible to prevent permanent damage. 
CHEMICAL 	AND	HEAT	BURNS	
First aid treatment is needed immediately for burns 
from chemicals, such as acids and caustic soda. 
	
Signs	and	Symptoms

FRACTURES 	
A  f r a c t u r e  i s  a  b r o k e n  o r  c r a c k e d  b o n e .  W h e n  t h e  b o n e  p i e r c e s  t h e  s k i n  i t  i s  c a l l e d  a  c o m p o u n d  o r  
open fracture. This fracture is very susceptible to infection a n d  c a n  r e s u l t  i n  c o n s i d e r a b l e  l o s s  o f  
blood. 
 
When the skin has not been broken it is called a closed fractur e (though there may be internal bleed-
ing and damage).  
In young children the bones, which are still flexible, may not break completely. These incomplete 
breaks are called greenstick fractures. 
 
If you suspect someone has a fra cture, seek medical aid immedia tely. 
	Signs	and	Symptoms 	
 the sound or feel of a bone breaking 
 intense pain around the break 
 deformity of the limb or an inability to move it naturally 
 tenderness when light pressure is applied 
 swelling 
 the sound of bone ends grating against each other 
	
WARNING 	
Do not move the broken bone if possible. 
Do not shift the casualty, unless essential to safety, if there  is a suspected back or neck fracture (see 
NECK AND SPINAL INJURIES) becaus e the spinal cord can be damage d by movement. 
Do not administer any food or dr ink because a general anaesthet ic may be needed.

 ACTION	
1 If there is an open wound, control BLEEDING and cover the wou nd with a sterile dressing; if 
the bone is protruding, use a ri ng pad (see DRESSINGS, PADS AND  BANDAGES). Then apply a bandage, 
making sure it is not directly over the fracture. 
2 Support the fractured limb in the most comfortable position. Raise and rest a fractured foot or 
ankle on pillows or folded  
blankets. 
3 Immobilise the fractured limb, using a splint or sling (see S PLINTS and SLINGS for information 
on the splints and slings appropriate to different fractures). Do not attempt to straighten the fractured 
limb. 
4 Check regularly that the bandages are not too tight, affectin g circulation. 
5 Watch for signs of SHOCK. 
6 Seek medical aid immediately. 
 For the treatment of fractured ribs see CHEST INJURIES.  
Fractured 	leg:	pad	well	between	the	legs	and	use	a	splint	if	possible	and	the	uninjured 	limb	for	support;	secure	the	legs	with	
bandages 	around	the	ankles	and	knees;	also	bandage	above	and	below	the	fracture	site	and	around	the	thighs	if	help	is	likely	
to	be	delayed.

 bleedin g or a flow of clear fluid from the nose or ears  Convulsions ( or fittin g )
 congested face  wounds to the head or face 
 one pupil lar ger than the other. 
	ACTION	
1 Treat the casualty as if unconscious: place him or her in the  lateral position, check the airway, 
breathing and give CPR if necessary (see EMERGENCY TECHNIQUES).  Do not move the casualty, un-
less it is essential for safety, because there may be a spinal injury (see NECK AND SPINAL INJURIES). If 
you must move the casualty, support the head and neck and move gently (see MOVING A CASUALTY). 
2 If the face is badly injured, keep the airway open with your fingers. 
3 Control EXTERNAL BLEEDING. Do not apply pressure to the scalp  if a fracture is suspected (see 
FRACTURES). If blood or fluid is coming from the ear, position the person as directed in EAR INJU-
RIES. Lightly cover any EYE IN JURIES with a clean dressing. 
FRACTURED 	JAW	
	
Signs	and	Symptoms 	
 swelling, pain or tenderness around the jaw 
 misalignment of the jaw and teeth 
 difficulty in closing the teeth 
 drooling of saliva 
	ACTION

 HEAT	EXHAUSTION 	AND	HEAT	STROKE	
Hyperthermia is the general term for heat exhaustion and heat s troke. Heat exhaustion is the result of 
excessive loss of body fluid through perspiration. Heat stroke is more unusual and more dangerous 
than heat exhaustion. It occurs when the body’s heat-regulating  mechanism fails completely. Early 
recognition and medical a ttention are essential. 
Heat exhaustion and heat stroke are most likely to occur in hot , humid conditions, particularly if pro-
longed exercise is involved. The young and the old are the most  susceptible because their bodies are 
the least efficient at regulating body temperature. Never leave  a baby in a closed car on a hot day. 
HEAT	EXHAUSTION 	
	
Signs	and	Symptoms 	
 feeling of being hot and exhausted 
 headache 
 faintness and giddiness 
 thirst 
 nausea 
 muscle cramps and weakness 
 pale, cold, clammy skin 
 heavy sweating 
 rapid pulse and breathing 
 lack of coordination 
 confusion and irritability 
	
ACTION	
1 Move the sufferer to a c ool place with fresh air. 
2 Lay the person down. Loosen hi s or her clothing and remove an y articles that are not needed. 
3 Sponge the sufferer with cool water. 
4 Encourage the person slowly to drink water, to which a small amount of sugar or glucose may 
be added. 5 Apply ice packs to the cramped  muscles (see SPRAINS AND DISLO CATIONS). 
6 If the person does not recover quickly or vomits, seek medica l aid immediately. 
HEAT	STROKE	
	
Signs	and	Symptoms 	
 hot, flushed, dry skin 
 headache 
 dizziness 
 rise in body TEMPERATURE to 40°C or more 
 rapid, pounding pulse 
 nausea and vomiting 
 confusion and irritability 
 loss of consciousness

utmost care to prevent further damage that could result in perm anent paralysis or even breathing and 
circulation failure. 
Injury to th e spine must always be suspected  if the casu alty is  unconscious from a head injury (see 
HEAD AND FACIAL INJURIES). 
	
Signs	and	Symptoms 	
 intense pain at or below the injury 
 tenderness at the site of the injury 
 tingling sensations in the hands and feet 
 loss of movement or feeling at or below the injury 
 In cases of damage to the spinal cord, there may also be: 
 loss of bowel and bladder control 
 breathing difficulty 
 SHOCK 
	WARNING 	
Never move a person with suspected spinal injuries unless essen tial to safety, for example if uncon-
s c i o u s .  L e a v e  m o v i n g  a  c a s u a l t y  t o  a m b u l a n c e  o f f i c e r s .  I f  y o u  m ust move the casualty, support the 
neck, head and spine (se e MOVING A CASUALTY). 
Do not twist or bend an injured spine. 
	
ACTION	
1 If the casualty is unconscious, place him or her in the lat-
eral position, carefully supporting the head and neck with your  
hand, check the airway, breathing and pulse and begin CPR if necessary (see EMERGENCY TECHNIQUES). 
2 If the casualty is conscious, cover and keep him or her as 
still as possible. Do not attempt to raise the head or give any -
thing to eat or drink. Loos en any tight clothing. 
3 If the neck has been injured, and particularly if the person

61 
 NOSE	BLEED	
A nosebleed can be cause by a heavy knock, blowing the nose too  hard or high blood pressure. Some-
times it occurs for no apparent r eason. Nosebleeds are quite co mmon among children. 
	
WARNING 	
Unconsciousness and a flow of pale fluid mixed with blood can i ndicate a head injury (see HEAD AND 
FACIAL INJURIES). This can be serious, even life-threatening, s o emergency first aid (see EMERGENCY 
TECHNIQUES) may be required and m edical aid should be sought im mediately. 
	
ACTION	
1 Tell the person not to blow his or her nose and to breathe 
through the mouth. 
2 Have the person sit down, lean slightly forward and hold 
his or her nostrils together for about 10 minutes. 
3 Loosen the clothing around  the neck, chest and waist. 
4  I f  t h e  n o s e  c o n t i n u e s  t o  b l e e d ,  r e p e a t  t h e  p r o c e d u r e .  T h e  
person should not blow the nose for several hours after bleedin g 
has stopped. If bleeding persists, seek medical advice. 
HYPOTHERMIA 	
Prolonged exposure to cold condi tions particularly wet and wind y weather or immersion in cold wa-
ter can cause the body’s heat-re gulating mechanism to fail, wit h severe, even fatal, results. Alcohol and 
drugs also decrease the functioning of the body’s heat-regulati ng mechanism. 
Hypothermia is the extreme cooling of the body, often caused by  protracted immersion in cold water. 
After the loss of the body’s surface heat, there is a cooling o f deep tissues and organs. 
As with over-exposure to heat, the young and the old are the mo st susceptible because their bodies 
are the least efficient at regulating body temperature. However , even young, fit adults can be seriously 
affected if they are exposed to extreme cold without adequate p rotection. 
Prolonged exposure of the extremities to severe cold can result  in frostbite: the small blood vessels 
constrict and cut the blood supply to the ears, nose, fingers o r toes. In extreme cases, gangrene may 
develop and amputation may be necessary. 
MILD	TO	MODERATE 	OVER‐EXPOSURE 	
	
Signs	and	Symptoms 	
 shivering and a feeling of being cold 
 extreme fatigue, drowsiness 
 cramps 
 blurred vision 
 slowing of mental and physical alertness 
 slurred speech and confusion 
 stumbling, uncoordinated movement 
	WARNING 	
Do not attempt to warm the victim quickly by using an electric blanket or hot-water bottle or by plac-
ing the person close to a fire or heater.  
	


--- PAGE 63 ---

Vital First Aid  Ph 1300 88 03 43 
 
62 
 
	
ACTION	
1 If the person is unconscious, place him or her in the lateral  position, check the airway, breath-
ing and pulse and begin CPR if necessary (see EMERGENCY TECHNIQ UES). 
2 Move the person to a sheltered, dry spot. Replace wet clothes  with warm, dry clothing, blankets 
or sleeping bag to prevent further heat loss. If it is availabl e, use windproof material, such as alumini-
um foil or plastic, for further protection. The body heat from another person is also a valuable aid: 
have someone, stripped to his or her underwear, share the blank ets or sleeping bag with the sufferer. 
3 If the person is conscious, gi ve him or her warm drinks. Do n ot give alcohol. 
4 Seek medical aid. 
EXTREME 	OVER‐EXPOSURE 	(HYPOTHERMIA) 	
	
Signs	and	Symptoms 	
 skin is cold to the touch 
 slow and shallow breathing 
 slow pulse 
 a baby becomes quiet and refuses food 
 Unconsciousness, particularly of the old or in-
firm. 
	WARNING 	
 The warming process must be gradual: sudden heating could cause  SHOCK. 
 Do not place anyone suffering from hypothermia in a bath. 
 Do not apply an electr ic blanket or hot-water bottle or warm th e victim by a fire or heater. 
	
ACTION	
1 Proceed as for Mild to Moderate Over-exposure, steps 1–3. 
2 Seek medical aid urgently and remain with the casualty until it is at hand. 
FROSTBITE 	
	
Signs	and	Symptoms 	
 affected part is tingling or numb 
 skin is waxy, white and firm to touch 
 pain is not felt until the area becomes warm again 
 blisters 
	WARNING 	
 Do not rub or massage  the affected part. 
 Do not apply direct heat, cold water or snow. 
 Do not give alcohol. 
	
ACTION	
1 Move the casualty to a warm, dry shelter if possible. 
2 Warm the affected area slowly, using body heat. For example, cup your hands around the af-
fected part or have the sufferer  put the part inside his or her  clothing or under an armpit. 
3 Cover any blisters with dry, sterile dressings. 
4 Seek medical aid.

 POISONING 	
Poisons can be swallowed, inhaled, absorbed or injected. Food, medicines and household and indus-
trial products can all be poisonous. 
	
REMEMBER 	
In many cases, accidental poisoning is avoidable (see FAMILY SA FETY). 
	
Signs	and	Symptoms 	
Depending on the nature of the p oison, signs and symptoms can i nclude: 
 pain, from the mouth to the abdomen 
 nausea 
 vomiting 
 drowsiness 
 faintness 
 tight chest and difficulty breathing 
 ringing ears 
 headache 
 odour of fumes 
 sweating 
 change of skin colour 
 breath odour 
 burns around and inside the mouth 
 unconsciousness 
 For specific information on a poison, phone the Poisons	Information 	Centre	on	13	11	26. This num-
ber can be called from any town in Australia. 
	
GENERAL 	ACTION	
1 If the casualty is unconscious, place him or her in the later al position, check the airway, breath-
ing and pulse and begin CPR if necessary (see EMERGENCY TECHNIQ UES). If CPR is required, make 
sure you wipe any poisonous substance from the casualty’s mouth  first. 
2 If the casualty is conscious, treat him or her according to t he poison taken. It is also important 
to establish what the drug or poison was because this may be of  help in the medical treatment of the 
casualty. 
3 Call for urgent medical aid. 
CORROSIVE, 	PETROL‐BASED	OR	
UNKNOWN 	SUBSTANCES 	
Corrosives are substances, such as battery acid, dishwasher det ergent, toilet cleaner and caustic soda, 
that burn tissues. 
	WARNING 	
Do not induce vomiting because i t could cause further damage to  the tissues and the lungs. 
	
ACTION	
1 Wash the casualty’s mouth and face clean of the substance.  
Do	not give anything by mouth. 
2 Seek medical aid urgently. 
  

--- PAGE 65 ---

Vital First Aid  Ph 1300 88 03 43 
 
64 
 MEDICINAL 	AND	GENERAL 	SUBSTANCES 	
General substances include plant s, such as some mushrooms, and detergent. 
	
WARNING 	
Do not attempt to induce vomitin g if the casualty is unconsciou s or lying on his or her back. 
	
ACTION	
If the Poisons Information Centre or doctor tells you to do so,  give syrup of ipecac, following the bot-
tle’s instructions, to induce vomiting. Do not use salted or so apy water to cause vomiting. 
INHALED 	POISONS	
Industrial gases, carbon monoxid e (in car exhaust fumes) or the  fumes from polyuret hane foam can all 
cause poisoning. 
	
ACTION	
1 Take care not to breathe any toxic fumes or gas yourself. Cov er your mouth and nose with a 
wet handkerchief. Ventilate the area thoroughly or move the cas ualty to fresh air if necessary. 
2 If the casualty is unconscious, place him or her in the later al position, check the airway, breath-
ing and pulse and begin CPR if necessary (see EMERGENCY TECHNIQ UES). 
3 Loosen any tight clothing. 
4 Seek medical aid urgently. 
ABSORBED 	POISONS 	
Toxic chemicals, such as pesticides, can be absorbed through th e skin. It may take some time before 
the symptoms become evident. Check whether the casualty has bee n in contact with any poison from, 
for example, crop spraying. 
	
ACTION	
1 Get the casualty to remove the contaminated clothing and foot wear. If you help, wear rubber 
gloves. 
2 Wash the contaminated skin thoroughly with soap and water (an d later wash the contaminat-
ed clothes separately from other articles). 
3 Seek medical aid if any of the signs or symptoms of poisoning  occur. If you know the name of 
the chemical, let the doctor  or hospital staff know. 
4 If the casualty becomes unconscious, place him or her in the lateral position, check the airway, 
breathing and pulse and begin CPR if necessary (see EMERGENCY T ECHNIQUES)

 SHOCK	
Clinical shock can occur when there is extreme pain, severe ble eding or heavy loss of fluid after, for 
example, major injury, vom iting, diarrhoea or burns. 
Clinical shock is a serious, lif e-threatening condition. It occ urs progressively, so watch closely for any 
signs, particularly deterioratio n in a casualty’s condition aft er an accident or sudden illness. 
	
Signs	and	Symptoms 	
 pale, cold, clammy skin 
 weak, rapid pulse 
 rapid breathing 
 faintness, dizziness 
 nausea 
 thirst 
 restlessness 
 drowsiness and confusion, leading  eventually to unconsciousness  
	
ACTION	
1 If the casualty becomes unconscious, place him or her in the lateral position, check the airway, 
breathing and pulse and begin CPR if necessary (see EMERGENCY T ECHNIQUES). 
2 If the casualty is conscious, lay him or her down. 
3 Because shock is brought on by major injury or illness you ne ed to identify and treat its cause. 
(The casualty may, for example, be BLEEDING heavily, have serio us BURNS AND SCALDS or have suf-
fered a HEART ATTACK). 
4 Seek medical aid urgently. 
5 Loosen any tight clothing. Try to maintain the body temperatu re, but do not over-heat the cas-
ualty. 
6 Do not give anything to eat or drink. If the casualty is thir sty, moisten the lips. 
7 Monitor the airway, breath ing and pulse regularly. 
SPLINTERS 	
Even a tiny fragment of wood or glass or a thorn can cause an i nfection if not removed. Large splinters 
deeply embedded are best  removed by a doctor. 
	
ACTION	
1 Sterilise splinter forceps, tweezers or splinter remover by b urning the ends over a flame or by 
boiling them in water for 5 minutes. 2 Wash the area surrounding the splinter. 
3 Grip the splinter, as close to the skin as possible, with the  splinter forceps and pull it out. If the 
splinter is too difficult to remove with forceps, use a splinte r remover to expose the splinter then pull 
the splinter out. 4 Wash the wound with soapy water or mild antiseptic, dry it an d, if necessary, cover it with an 
adhesive strip dressing. 
5 If the wound becomes infected or swollen, seek medical advice .

 SPRAINS 	AND	DISLOCATIONS 	
When a joint is forced beyond its normal range of movement the ligaments that hold it together be-
come sprained (that is, stretched or torn); the joint becomes d islocated if its bones are pushed out of 
contact with each other. 
Sprains and dislocations are often associated with FRACTURES an d have the same symptoms. If you 
are unsure, treat such an injury as a fracture and seek medical  aid immediately. 
The most common dislocations involve the shoulder, elbow, finge r and jaw. Sprains often occur to an-
kles, but also affect wrists, elb ows, knees, hips and shoulders . 
SPRAINS	
	
Signs	and	Symptoms 	
 pain and tenderness around the joint 
 restricted movement of the joint 
 swelling and bruising 
	WARNING 	
Do not move the joint if you suspect it is fractured. 
	
ACTION	
1 Apply a compression bandage that extends well beyond the site  (see DRESSINGS, PADS AND 
BANDAGES). 
2 Rest the joint in the most comfortable position and apply ice  packs to ease the pain and swell-
ing. 
3 Seek medical aid. 
DISLOCATIONS 	
	
Signs	and	Symptoms 	
 intense pain 
 deformity 
 inability to move the joint 
 swelling and bruising 
	
WARNING 	
Do not move the joint if you suspect it is fractured. 
Do not attempt to push the joint bones back into position. 
	
ACTION	
1 Support and rest the joint in the most comfortable position. 2 Apply ice packs  
3 Seek medical aid immediately.

 SUNBURN 	
Over-exposure to strong sun, particularly in the middle of the day, can cause redness, inflammation, 
swelling and blistered skin, whi ch will eventually dry out and flake off. In the long-term over-exposure 
can lead to freckling, blotchy skin and even skin cancer. Child ren are especially vulnerable and need 
maximum protection. 
	
REMEMBER 	
The best cure is prevention. Stay out of the sun in the heat of  the day, wear adequate clothing, a hat 
and a total block-out lotion. 
	
ACTION	
1 Move the person inside or into the shade. 
2 Reduce the pain with a cool shower, bath or compress to the a ffected part, but do not chill the 
person. Be careful not to break any blisters. 
3 Give plenty of cool fluids. 4 The sufferer should cover the sunburn if going out in the sun . 
5 Seek medical aid if a person blisters or a young child is inv olved.

SWALLOWED 	OBJECTS 	
Swallowed objects are a common occurrence, especially with youn g children. Very small, smooth ob-
jects may not be a problem, but sharp, jagged objects such as b ones, nails or glass, can be dangerous.  
Always check children’s and babies’ toys to make sure there are  no loose, small or sharp parts that 
could easily be swallowed. 
	ACTION	
1 Do not give anything to eat or drink.

 TEETH	INJURIES 	
A tooth that has been knocked out of the mouth can be saved if you act quickly. Baby or first teeth, 
however, should not be replaced. Anyone who has damaged his or 
her teeth should see a den tist as soon as possible. 
	
ACTION	
1. Clean the tooth that has been knocked out, by having the cas ualty 
suck it. If this is not possible, use saliva or milk that has n ot been 
warmed. If there is no other option, wash the tooth under tap w a-
ter. 
2 .  P l a c e  t h e  t o o t h  i n  i t s  o r i g i n a l  s o c k e t  a n d  h o l d  i t  t h e r e  f o r  2  
minutes. 
3. Mould a piece of aluminium foil over it and the two teeth on  ei-
ther side to form a temporary splint. The casualty should bite down to keep this in place. 
4. If the tooth cannot be replac ed in the mouth immediately, ke ep it moist in saliva or milk. 
5. Seek dental aid immediately. 
 
 
VOMITING 	AND	DIARRHOEA 	
Stomach pains, vomiting and diarrhoea can have many different c auses including food poisoning and 
viral infections, so it is important to see your doctor if the symptoms persist. Vomiting and diarrhoea 
are common in young children and are often caused by gastroente ritis, a viral infection of the bowel, 
but they can also be cause d but other infections. 
Food poisoning often results from eating food contaminated by b acteria. Bacteria can breed in foods, 
such as fish, chicken, ham and d airy products that are not prop erly stored. Food should always be well 
cooked and eaten immediately, or  refrigerated as soon as it is bought. If food is reheated always bring 
it to boiling point. Food poisoning can also result from natura lly occurring toxins in some plants and 
fish (see POISONING). 
Vomiting and diarrhoea can cause dehydration – loss of the flui ds required for the normal functioning 
of the body – particularly in ba bies and small children, so it is important that sufferers drink lots of 
fluid. 
GASTROENTERITIS 	IN	BABIES	AND	YOUNG	CHILDREN

ACTION	
1 Stop solid food and cow’s milk  (but continue breast milk if t he child is breast fed) and give re-
hydration fluid to drink: 1 cup (150–200 ml) every time the chi ld vomits or passes a watery stool. If 
vomiting is frequent, give smaller amounts more often: 50 ml ev ery 15 minutes. A suitable rehydra-
tion fluid is Gastrolyte, which can be bought at a chemist; it should be made up carefully according to 
the instructions on the container. You can also give: sugar (1 level teaspoon to 120 ml water); cordial 
that is not low calorie (1 part to 6 parts water); natural frui t juice (1 part to 4 parts water); or lemon-
ade that is not low calorie (1 part to 4 parts water). Remember  to  dilute these liquids as described 
here; if they are given undiluted they may make the diarrhoea w orse. Do not stop solid food and milk 
for more than 24 hours. 
2 After the first 24 hours continue to give rehydration fluid b etween meals, but reintroduce solid 
f o o d  a n d  c o w ’ s  m i l k .  S t a r t  w i t h  c o o k e d  v e g e t a b l e s  a nd  c e r e al s ,  i n c l u d i ng  b r e a d ,  a nd  t h e n  a d d  d a i r y  
products, eggs and meat. 3 Seek medical aid if: the child has a lot of diarrhoea (8–10 w atery stools or 2–3 very large stools 
a day); vomiting persists and little fluid is kept down; there are signs of dehydration; the child devel-
ops severe stomach pain; vomiting and/or diarrhoea persists in a baby or child for more than 24
