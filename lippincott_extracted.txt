I.  Overview
Pharmacokinetics refers to what the body does to a drug, whereas pharmacodynamics (see Chapter 2) describes what
the drug does to the body. Four pharmacokinetic properties determine the onset, intensity, and duration of drug
action (Figure 1.1):
19
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 20 ---

Figure 1.1 Schematic representation of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and
elimination.
20
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 21 ---

Absorption: First, absorption from the site of administration permits entry of the drug (either directly or
indirectly) into plasma.
Distribution: Second, the drug may reversibly leave the bloodstream and distribute into the interstitial and
intracellular fluids.Metabolism: Third, the drug may be biotransformed through metabolism by the liver or other tissues.
Elimination: Finally, the drug and its metabolites are eliminated from the body in urine, bile, or feces.
Using knowledge of pharmacokinetic parameters, clinicians can design optimal drug regimens, including the route
of administration, dose, frequency, and duration of treatment.
21

--- PAGE 22 ---

II.  Routes of Drug Administration
The route of administration is determined by properties of the drug (for example, water or lipid solubility,
ionization) and by the therapeutic objectives (for example, the need for a rapid onset, the need for long-term
treatment, or restriction of delivery to a local site). Major routes of drug administration include enteral, parenteral,
and topical, among others (Figure 1.2).
Figure 1.2 Commonly used routes of drug administration. IV = intravenous; IM =
intramuscular; SC = subcutaneous.
22
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 23 ---

A.  Enteral
Enteral administration (administering a drug by mouth) is the most common, convenient, and economical method of
drug administration. The drug may be swallowed, allowing oral delivery, or it may be placed under the tongue
(sublingual) or between the gums and cheek (buccal), facilitating direct absorption into the bloodstream.
1.  Oral
Oral administration provides many advantages. Oral drugs are easily self-administered, and toxicities and/or
overdose of oral drugs may be overcome with antidotes, such as activated charcoal. However, the pathways involved
in oral drug absorption are the most complicated, and the low gastric pH inactivates some drugs. A wide range of
oral preparations is available including enteric-coated and extended-release preparations.
a.  Enteric-coated preparations
An enteric coating is a chemical envelope that protects the drug from stomach acid, delivering it instead to the less
acidic intestine, where the coating dissolves and releases the drug. Enteric coating is useful for certain drugs (for
example, omeprazole) that are acid labile, and for drugs that are irritating to the stomach, such as aspirin.
b.  Extended-release preparations
Extended-release (abbreviated ER, XR, XL, SR, etc.) medications have special coatings or ingredients that control
drug release, thereby allowing for slower absorption and prolonged duration of action. ER formulations can be
dosed less frequently and may improve patient compliance. In addition, ER formulations may maintain
concentrations within the therapeutic range over a longer duration, as opposed to immediate-release dosage forms,
which may result in larger peaks and troughs in plasma concentration. ER formulations are advantageous for drugs
with short half-lives. For example, the half-life of oral morphine is 2 to 4 hours, and it must be administered six
times daily to provide continuous pain relief. However, only two doses are needed when extended-release tablets are
used.
2.  Sublingual/buccal
The sublingual route involves placement of drug under the tongue. The buccal route involves placement of drug
between the cheek and gum. Both the sublingual and buccal routes of absorption have several advantages, including
ease of administration, rapid absorption, bypass of the harsh gastrointestinal (GI) environment, and avoidance of
first-pass metabolism (see discussion of first-pass metabolism below).
23
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 24 ---

B.  Parenteral
The parenteral route introduces drugs directly into the systemic circulation. Parenteral administration is used for
drugs that are poorly absorbed from the GI tract (for example, heparin) or unstable in the GI tract (for example,
insulin). Parenteral administration is also used for patients unable to take oral medications (unconscious patients)
and in circumstances that require a rapid onset of action. Parenteral administration provides the most control over
the dose of drug delivered to the body. However, this route of administration is irreversible and may cause pain,
fear, local tissue damage, and infections. The four major parenteral routes are intravascular (intravenous or intra-
arterial), intramuscular, subcutaneous, and intradermal (Figure 1.3).

Figure 1.3 A. Schematic representation of subcutaneous and intramuscular injection. B.
Plasma concentrations of midazolam after intravenous and intramuscular injection.
1.  Intravenous (IV)
IV injection is the most common parenteral route. It is useful for drugs that are not absorbed orally, such as the
neuromuscular blocker rocuronium. IV delivery permits a rapid effect and a maximum degree of control over the
amount of drug delivered. When injected as a bolus, the full amount of drug is delivered to the systemic circulation
almost immediately. If administered as an IV infusion, the drug is infused over a longer period, resulting in lower
peak plasma concentrations and an increased duration of circulating drug.
2.  Intramuscular (IM)
Drugs administered IM can be in aqueous solutions, which are absorbed rapidly, or in specialized depot
preparations, which are absorbed slowly. Depot preparations often consist of a suspension of drug in a nonaqueous
vehicle, such as polyethylene glycol. As the vehicle diffuses out of the muscle, drug precipitates at the site of
injection. The drug then dissolves slowly, providing a sustained dose over an extended interval.
3.  Subcutaneous (SC)
Like IM injection, SC injection provides absorption via simple diffusion and is slower than the IV route. SC
injection minimizes the risks of hemolysis or thrombosis associated with IV injection and may provide constant,
slow, and sustained effects. This route should not be used with drugs that cause tissue irritation, because severe pain
and necrosis may occur.
4.  Intradermal (ID)
The intradermal (ID) route involves injection into the dermis, the more vascular layer of skin under the epidermis.
Agents for diagnostic determination and desensitization are usually administered by this route.
26

--- PAGE 27 ---

C.  Other
1.  Oral inhalation and nasal preparations
Both the oral inhalation and nasal routes of administration provide rapid delivery of drug across the large surface
area of mucous membranes of the respiratory tract and pulmonary epithelium. Drug effects are almost as rapid as are
those with IV bolus. Drugs that are gases (for example, some anesthetics) and those that can be dispersed in an
aerosol are administered via inhalation. This route is effective and convenient for patients with respiratory disorders
such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, because drug is delivered directly to the site of action,
thereby minimizing systemic side effects. The nasal route involves topical administration of drugs directly into the
nose, and it is often used for patients with allergic rhinitis.
2.  Intrathecal/intraventricular
The blood–brain barrier typically delays or prevents the absorption of drugs into the central nervous system (CNS).
When local, rapid effects are needed, it is necessary to introduce drugs directly into the cerebrospinal fluid.
3.  Topical
Topical application is used when a local effect of the drug is desired.
4.  Transdermal
This route of administration achieves systemic effects by application of drugs to the skin, usually via a transdermal
patch (Figure 1.4). The rate of absorption can vary markedly, depending on the physical characteristics of the skin at
the site of application, as well as the lipid solubility of the drug.

5.  Rectal
Because 50% of the drainage of the rectal region bypasses the portal circulation, the biotransformation of drugs by
the liver is minimized with rectal administration. The rectal route has the additional advantage of preventing
destruction of the drug in the GI environment. This route is also useful if the drug induces vomiting when given
orally, if the patient is already vomiting, or if the patient is unconscious. Rectal absorption is often erratic and
incomplete, and many drugs irritate the rectal mucosa. Figure 1.5 summarizes characteristics of the common routes
of administration, along with example drugs.

routes of administration.

III.  Absorption of Drugs
Absorption is the transfer of a drug from the site of administration to the bloodstream. The rate and extent of
absorption depend on the environment where the drug is absorbed, chemical characteristics of the drug, and the
route of administration (which influences bioavailability). Routes of administration other than intravenous may
result in partial absorption and lower bioavailability.

A.  Mechanisms of absorption of drugs from the GI tract
Depending on their chemical properties, drugs may be absorbed from the GI tract by passive diffusion, facilitated
diffusion, active transport, or endocytosis (Figure 1.6).

Figure 1.6 Schematic representation of drugs crossing a cell membrane. ATP =
adenosine triphosphate; ADP = adenosine diphosphate.
1.  Passive diffusion
The driving force for passive diffusion of a drug is the concentration gradient across a membrane separating two
body compartments. In other words, the drug moves from an area of high concentration to one of lower
concentration. Passive diffusion does not involve a carrier, is not saturable, and shows low structural specificity. The
vast majority of drugs are absorbed by this mechanism. Water-soluble drugs penetrate the cell membrane through
aqueous channels or pores, whereas lipid-soluble drugs readily move across most biologic membranes due to
solubility in the membrane lipid bilayers.
2.  Facilitated diffusion
Other agents can enter the cell through specialized transmembrane carrier proteins that facilitate the passage of large
molecules. These carrier proteins undergo conformational changes, allowing the passage of drugs or endogenous
molecules into the interior of cells. This process is known as facilitated diffusion. It does not require energy, can be
saturated, and may be inhibited by compounds that compete for the carrier.
3.  Active transport
This mode of drug entry also involves specific carrier proteins that span the membrane. However, active transport is
energy dependent, driven by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). It is capable of moving drugs against a
concentration gradient, from a region of low drug concentration to one of higher concentration. The process is
saturable. Active transport systems are selective and may be competitively inhibited by other cotransported
substances.
4.  Endocytosis and exocytosis
This type of absorption is used to transport drugs of exceptionally large size across the cell membrane. Endocytosis
involves engulfment of a drug by the cell membrane and transport into the cell by pinching off the drug-filled
vesicle. Exocytosis is the reverse of endocytosis. Many cells use exocytosis to secrete substances out of the cell
through a similar process of vesicle formation. Vitamin B12 is transported across the gut wall by endocytosis,
whereas certain neurotransmitters (for example, norepinephrine) are stored in intracellular vesicles in the nerve
terminal and released by exocytosis.

--- PAGE 34 ---

B.  Factors influencing absorption
1.  Effect of pH on drug absorption
Most drugs are either weak acids or weak bases. Acidic drugs (HA) release a proton (H+), causing a charged anion
(A−) to form:
Weak bases (BH+) can also release an H+. However, the protonated form of basic drugs is usually charged, and loss
of a proton produces the uncharged base (B):
A drug passes through membranes more readily if it is uncharged (Figure 1.7). Thus, for a weak acid, the uncharged,
protonated HA can permeate through membranes, and A− cannot. For a weak base, the uncharged form B penetrates
through the cell membrane, but the protonated form BH+ does not. Therefore, the effective concentration of the
permeable form of each drug at its absorption site is determined by the relative concentrations of the charged and
uncharged forms. The ratio between the two forms is, in turn, determined by the pH at the site of absorption and by
the strength of the weak acid or base, which is represented by the ionization constant, pKa (Figure 1.8). [Note: The
pKa is a measure of the strength of the interaction of a compound with a proton. The lower the pKa of a drug, the
more acidic it is. Conversely, the higher the pKa, the more basic is the drug.] Distribution equilibrium is achieved
when the permeable form of a drug achieves an equal concentration in all body water spaces.

Figure 1.8 The distribution of a drug between its ionized and nonionized forms depends
on the ambient pH and pKa of the drug. For illustrative purposes, the drug has been
assigned a pKa of 6.5.
2.  Blood flow to the absorption site
The intestines receive much more blood flow than does the stomach, so absorption from the intestine is favored over
the stomach. [Note: Shock severely reduces blood flow to cutaneous tissues, thereby minimizing absorption from SC
administration.]
3.  Total surface area available for absorption
With a surface rich in brush borders containing microvilli, the intestine has a surface area about 1000-fold that of the
stomach, making absorption of the drug across the intestine more efficient.
4.  Contact time at the absorption surface
If a drug moves through the GI tract very quickly, as can happen with severe diarrhea, it is not well absorbed.
Conversely, anything that delays the transport of the drug from the stomach to the intestine delays the rate of
absorption. [Note: The presence of food in the stomach both dilutes the drug and slows gastric emptying. Therefore,
a drug taken with a meal is generally absorbed more slowly.]
5.  Expression of P-glycoprotein
P-glycoprotein is a transmembrane transporter protein responsible for transporting various molecules, including
drugs, across cell membranes (Figure 1.9). It is expressed in tissues throughout the body, including the liver,
kidneys, placenta, intestines, and brain capillaries, and is involved in transportation of drugs from tissues to blood.
That is, it “pumps” drugs out of cells. Thus, in areas of high expression, P-glycoprotein reduces drug absorption. In
addition to transporting many drugs out of cells, it is also associated with multidrug resistance.

C.  Bioavailability
Bioavailability is the rate and extent to which an administered drug reaches the systemic circulation. For example, if
100 mg of a drug is administered orally and 70 mg is absorbed unchanged, the bioavailability is 0.7 or 70%.
Determining bioavailability is important for calculating drug dosages for nonintravenous routes of administration.
1.  Determination of bioavailability
Bioavailability is determined by comparing plasma levels of a drug after a particular route of administration (for
example, oral administration) with levels achieved by IV administration. After IV administration, 100% of the drug
rapidly enters the circulation. When the drug is given orally, only part of the administered dose appears in the
plasma. By plotting plasma concentrations of the drug versus time, the area under the curve (AUC) can be measured.
A schematic depiction of determination of bioavailability is provided in Figure 1.10.
Figure 1.10 Determination of the bioavailability of a drug. AUC = area under curve; IV
= intravenous.
2.  Factors that influence bioavailability
In contrast to IV administration, which confers 100% bioavailability, orally administered drugs often undergo first-
pass metabolism. This biotransformation, in addition to chemical and physical characteristics of the drug, determines
the rate and extent to which the agent reaches the systemic circulation.
a.  First-pass hepatic metabolism
When a drug is absorbed from the GI tract, it enters the portal circulation before entering the systemic circulation
(Figure 1.11). If the drug is rapidly metabolized in the liver or gut wall during this initial passage, the amount of
unchanged drug entering the systemic circulation is decreased. This is referred to as first-pass metabolism. [Note:
First-pass metabolism by the intestine or liver limits the efficacy of many oral medications. For example, more than
90% of nitroglycerin is cleared during first-pass metabolism. Hence, it is primarily administered via the sublingual,
transdermal, or intravenous route.] Drugs with high first-pass metabolism should be given in doses sufficient to
ensure that enough active drug reaches the desired site of action.38

--- PAGE 40 ---

b.  Solubility of the drug
Very hydrophilic drugs are poorly absorbed because of the inability to cross lipid-rich cell membranes.
Paradoxically, drugs that are extremely lipophilic are also poorly absorbed, because they are insoluble in aqueous
body fluids and, therefore, cannot gain access to the surface of cells. For a drug to be readily absorbed, it must be
largely lipophilic, yet have some solubility in aqueous solutions. This is one reason why many drugs are either weak
acids or weak bases.
c.  Chemical instability
Some drugs, such as penicillin G, are unstable in the pH of gastric contents. Others, such as insulin, are destroyed in
the GI tract by degradative enzymes.
d.  Nature of the drug formulation
Drug absorption may be altered by factors unrelated to the chemistry of the drug. For example, particle size, salt
form, crystal polymorphism, enteric coatings, and the presence of excipients (such as binders and dispersing agents)
can influence the ease of dissolution and, therefore, alter the rate of absorption.
40
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 41 ---

D.  Bioequivalence and other types of equivalence
Two drug formulations are bioequivalent if they show comparable bioavailability and similar times to achieve peak
blood concentrations. Two drug formulations are therapeutically equivalent if they are pharmaceutically equivalent
(that is, they have the same dosage form, contain the same active ingredient at the same strength, and use the same
route of administration) with similar clinical and safety profiles. Thus, therapeutic equivalence requires that drug
products are bioequivalent and pharmaceutically equivalent.

IV.  Drug Distribution
Drug distribution is the process by which a drug reversibly leaves the bloodstream and enters the extracellular fluid
and tissues. For drugs administered IV, absorption is not a factor, and the initial phase immediately following
administration represents the distribution phase, during which the drug rapidly leaves the circulation and enters the
tissues (Figure 1.12). The distribution of a drug from the plasma to the interstitium depends on cardiac output and
local blood flow, capillary permeability, tissue volume, degree of binding of the drug to plasma and tissue proteins,
and relative lipophilicity of the drug.
Figure 1.12 Drug concentrations in serum after a single injection of drug. Assume that
the drug distributes and is subsequently eliminated.
42
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 43 ---

A.  Blood flow
The rate of blood flow to the tissue capillaries varies widely. For instance, blood flow to “vessel-rich organs” (brain,
liver, and kidney) is greater than that to the skeletal muscles. Adipose tissue, skin, and viscera have still lower rates
of blood flow. Variation in blood flow partly explains the short duration of hypnosis produced by an IV bolus of
propofol  (see Chapter 13). High blood flow, together with high lipophilicity of propofol , permits rapid distribution
into the CNS and produces anesthesia. A subsequent slower distribution to skeletal muscle and adipose tissue lowers
the plasma concentration so that the drug diffuses out of the CNS, down the concentration gradient, and
consciousness is regained.
43
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 44 ---

B.  Capillary permeability
Capillary permeability is determined by capillary structure and by the chemical nature of the drug. Capillary
structure varies in terms of the fraction of the basement membrane exposed by slit junctions between endothelial
cells. In the liver and spleen, a significant portion of the basement membrane is exposed due to large, discontinuous
capillaries through which large plasma proteins can pass ( Figure 1.13A). In the brain, the capillary structure is
continuous, and there are no slit junctions (Figure 1.13B ). To enter the brain, drugs must pass through the
endothelial cells of the CNS capillaries or undergo active transport. For example, a specific transporter carries
levodopa into the brain. Lipid-soluble drugs readily penetrate the CNS because they dissolve in the endothelial cell
membrane. By contrast, ionized or polar drugs generally fail to enter the CNS because they cannot pass through the
endothelial cells that have no slit junctions ( Figure 1.13C ). These closely juxtaposed cells form tight junctions that
constitute the blood–brain barrier.

C.  Binding of drugs to plasma proteins and tissues
1.  Binding to plasma proteins
Reversible binding to plasma proteins sequesters drugs in a nondiffusible form and slows transfer out of the vascular
compartment. Albumin is the major drug-binding protein, and it may act as a drug reservoir. As the concentration of
free drug decreases due to elimination, the bound drug dissociates from albumin. This maintains the free-drug
concentration as a constant fraction of the total drug in the plasma.
2.  Binding to tissue proteins
Many drugs accumulate in tissues, leading to higher concentrations in tissues than in interstitial fluid and blood.
Drugs may accumulate because of binding to lipids, proteins, or nucleic acids. Drugs may also undergo active
transport into tissues. Tissue reservoirs may serve as a major source of the drug and prolong its actions or cause
local drug toxicity. (For example, acrolein, the metabolite of cyclophosphamide, can cause hemorrhagic cystitis
because it accumulates in the bladder.)
47
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 48 ---

D.  Lipophilicity
The chemical nature of a drug strongly influences its ability to cross cell membranes. Lipophilic drugs readily move
across most biologic membranes. These drugs dissolve in the lipid membranes and penetrate the entire cell surface.
The major factor influencing the distribution of lipophilic drugs is blood flow to the area. By contrast, hydrophilic
drugs do not readily penetrate cell membranes and must pass through slit junctions.
48
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 49 ---

E.  Volume of distribution
The apparent volume of distribution, Vd, is defined as the fluid volume that is required to contain the entire drug in
the body at the same concentration measured in the plasma. It is calculated by dividing the dose that ultimately gets
into the systemic circulation by the plasma concentration at time zero (C0).
Although Vd has no physiologic or physical basis, it can be useful to compare the distribution of a drug with the
volumes of the water compartments in the body.
1.  Distribution into the water compartments in the body
Once a drug enters the body, it has the potential to distribute into any one of the three functionally distinct
compartments of body water or to become sequestered in a cellular site.
a.  Plasma compartment
If a drug has a high molecular weight or is extensively protein bound, it is too large to pass through the slit junctions
of the capillaries and, thus, is effectively trapped within the plasma (vascular) compartment. As a result, it has a low
Vd that approximates the plasma volume, or about 4 L in a 70-kg individual. Heparin (see Chapter 21) shows this
type of distribution.
b.  Extracellular fluid
If a drug has a low molecular weight but is hydrophilic, it can pass through the endothelial slit junctions of the
capillaries into the interstitial fluid. However, hydrophilic drugs cannot move across the lipid membranes of cells to
enter the intracellular fluid. Therefore, these drugs distribute into a volume that is the sum of the plasma volume and
the interstitial fluid, which together constitute the extracellular fluid (about 20% of body weight or 14 L in a 70-kg
individual). Aminoglycoside antibiotics (see Chapter 30) show this type of distribution.
Total body water
If a drug has a low molecular weight and has enough lipophilicity, it can move into the interstitium through the slit
junctions and pass through the cell membranes into the intracellular fluid. These drugs distribute into a volume of
about 60% of body weight or about 42 L in a 70-kg individual. Ethanol  exhibits this apparent Vd. [Note: In general,
a larger Vd indicates greater distribution into tissues; a smaller Vd suggests confinement to plasma or extracellular
fluid.]
2.  Determination of V d
The fact that drug clearance is usually a first-order process allows calculation of Vd. First order means that a
constant fraction of the drug is eliminated per unit of time. This process can be most easily analyzed by plotting the
log of the plasma drug concentration (Cp) versus time (Figure 1.14). The concentration of drug in the plasma can be
extrapolated back to time zero (the time of IV bolus) on the Y axis to determine C0, which is the concentration of
drug that would have been achieved if the distribution phase had occurred instantly. This allows calculation of Vd as

--- PAGE 51 ---

Figure 1.14 Drug concentrations in plasma after a single injection of drug at time = 0. A.
Concentration data are plotted on a linear scale. B. Concentration data are plotted on a
log scale.
For example, if 10 mg of drug is injected into a patient and the plasma concentration is extrapolated back to time
zero, and C0 = 1 mg/L (from the graph in Figure 1.14B ), then Vd = 10 mg/1 mg/L = 10 L.
3.  Effect of V d on drug half-life
Vd has an important influence on the half-life of a drug, because drug elimination depends on the amount of drug
delivered to the liver or kidney (or other organs where metabolism occurs) per unit of time. Delivery of drug to the
organs of elimination depends not only on blood flow but also on the fraction of drug in the plasma. If a drug has a
large Vd, most of the drug is in the extraplasmic space and is unavailable to the excretory organs. Therefore, any
factor that increases Vd can increase the half-life and extend the duration of action of the drug. [Note: An
exceptionally large Vd indicates considerable sequestration of the drug in some tissues or compartments.]
51
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 52 ---

V.  Drug Clearance Through Metabolism
Once a drug enters the body, the process of elimination begins. The three major routes of elimination are hepatic
metabolism, biliary elimination, and urinary excretion. [Note: Elimination is irreversible removal of drug from the
body. It involves biotransformation (drug metabolism) and excretion. Excretion is removal of intact drug from the
body.] Together, these elimination processes decrease the plasma concentration exponentially. That is, a constant
fraction of the drug is eliminated in a given unit of time (Figure 1.14A). Metabolism results in products with
increased polarity, which allows the drug to be eliminated. Clearance (CL) estimates the volume of blood from
which the drug is cleared per unit of time. Total CL is a composite estimate reflecting all mechanisms of drug
elimination and is calculated as follows:
where t1/2 is the elimination half-life, Vd is the apparent volume of distribution, and 0.693 is the natural log constant.
Drug half-life is often used as a measure of drug CL, because, for many drugs, Vd is a constant.

A.  Kinetics of metabolism
1.  First-order kinetics
The metabolic transformation of drugs is catalyzed by enzymes, and most of the reactions obey Michaelis-Menten
kinetics, where Km is Michaelis constant (the substrate concentration at half maximal velocity).
In most clinical situations, the concentration of the drug, [C], is much less than the Michaelis constant, Km, and the
Michaelis-Menten equation reduces to
That is, the rate of drug metabolism and elimination is directly proportional to the concentration of free drug, and
first-order kinetics is observed (Figure 1.15). This means that a constant fraction of drug is metabolized per unit of
time (that is, with each half-life, the concentration decreases by 50%). First-order kinetics is also referred to as linear
kinetics.
53

--- PAGE 54 ---

Figure 1.15 Effect of drug dose on the rate of metabolism.
2.  Zero-order kinetics
With a few drugs, such as aspirin, ethanol , and phenytoin, the doses are very large. Therefore, [C] is much greater
than Km, and the velocity equation becomes
The enzyme is saturated by a high free drug concentration, and the rate of metabolism remains constant over time.
This is called zero-order kinetics (also called nonlinear kinetics). A constant amount of drug is metabolized per unit
of time. The rate of elimination is constant and does not depend on the drug concentration.
54
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 55 ---

B.  Reactions of drug metabolism
The kidney cannot efficiently excrete lipophilic drugs that readily cross cell membranes and are reabsorbed in the
distal convoluted tubules. Therefore, lipid-soluble agents are first metabolized into more polar (hydrophilic)
substances in the liver via two general sets of reactions, called phase I and phase II (Figure 1.16).
Figure 1.16 The biotransformation of drugs.
1.  Phase I
Phase I reactions convert lipophilic drugs into more polar molecules by introducing or unmasking a polar functional
group, such as –OH or –NH2. Phase I reactions usually involve reduction, oxidation, or hydrolysis. Phase I
metabolism may increase, decrease, or have no effect on pharmacologic activity.
a.  Phase I reactions utilizing the P450 system
The phase I reactions most frequently involved in drug metabolism are catalyzed by the cytochrome P450 (CYP)
system. The P450 system is important for the metabolism of many endogenous compounds (such as steroids, lipids)
and for the biotransformation of exogenous substances (drugs, carcinogens, and environmental pollutants). CYP is a
superfamily of heme-containing isozymes located in most cells, but primarily in the liver and GI tract.
[1]  Nomenclature
The family name is indicated by the Arabic number that follows CYP, and the capital letter designates the
subfamily, for example, CYP3A (Figure 1.17). A second number indicates the specific isozyme, as in CYP3A4.
55
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 56 ---

Figure 1.17 Relative contribution of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms to drug
biotransformation.
[2]  Specificity
Because there are many different genes that encode multiple enzymes, there are many different P450 isoforms.
These enzymes have the capacity to modify a large number of structurally diverse substrates. In addition, an
individual drug may be a substrate for more than one isozyme. Four isozymes (CYP3A4/5, CYP2D6, CYP2C8/9,
and CYP1A2) are responsible for the vast majority of P450-catalyzed reactions (Figure 1.17). Considerable amounts
of CYP3A4 are found in intestinal mucosa, accounting for first-pass metabolism of drugs such as chlorpromazine
and clonazepam.
[3]  Genetic variability
P450 enzymes exhibit considerable genetic variability among individuals and racial groups. Variations in P450
activity may alter drug efficacy and the risk of adverse events. CYP2D6, in particular, exhibits genetic
polymorphism. CYP2D6 mutations result in very low capacities to metabolize substrates. For example, some
individuals obtain no benefit from the opioid analgesic codeine, because they lack the CYP2D6 enzyme that
activates the drug. Similar polymorphisms have been characterized for the CYP2C subfamily of isozymes. For
instance, clopidogrel  carries a warning that patients who are CYP2C19 “poor metabolizers” have a diminished
antiplatelet effect when taking this drug and an alternative medication should be considered. Clopidogrel  is a
prodrug, and CYP2C19 activity is required to convert it to the active metabolite.
[4]  CYP inducers
The CYP450-dependent enzymes are an important target for pharmacokinetic drug interactions. Certain drugs (for
example, phenobarbital , rifampin, and carbamazepine) are capable of inducing CYP isozymes. This results in
increased biotransformation of drugs and can lead to significant decreases in plasma concentrations of drugs
metabolized by these CYP isozymes, often with concurrent loss of pharmacologic effect. For example, rifampin, an
antituberculosis drug (see Chapter 32), significantly decreases the plasma concentrations of human56
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 57 ---

immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitors, thereby diminishing the ability to suppress HIV replication.
Figure 1.18 lists some of the more important inducers for representative CYP isozymes.
Figure 1.18 Some representative cytochrome P450 isozymes. CYP = cytochrome P.
*Unlike most other CYP450 enzymes, CYP2D6 is not very susceptible to enzyme
induction.
[5]  CYP inhibitors
Inhibition of drug metabolism can lead to significant increases in plasma drug concentration and resultant adverse
effects or drug toxicity. The most common form of inhibition is through competition for the same isozyme. Some
drugs, however, are capable of inhibiting reactions for which they are not substrates (for example, ketoconazole),
leading to drug interactions. Numerous drugs inhibit one or more of the CYP-dependent biotransformation pathways
of warfarin. For example, omeprazole is a potent inhibitor of three CYP isozymes involved in warfarin metabolism.57
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 58 ---

When taken with omeprazole, plasma concentrations of warfarin increase, which leads to greater anticoagulant
effect and increased risk of bleeding. [Note: The more important CYP inhibitors are erythromycin, ketoconazole,
and ritonavir, because they each inhibit several CYP isozymes.]
b.  Phase I reactions not involving the P450 system
These include amine oxidation (for example, oxidation of catecholamines or histamine), alcohol dehydrogenation
(for example, ethanol  oxidation), esterases (for example, metabolism of aspirin in the liver), and hydrolysis (for
example, of procaine).
2.  Phase II
This phase consists of conjugation reactions. If the metabolite from phase I is sufficiently polar, it can be excreted
by the kidneys. However, many phase I metabolites are still too lipophilic to be excreted. A subsequent conjugation
reaction with an endogenous substrate, such as glucuronic acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid, or an amino acid, results in
polar, usually more water-soluble compounds that are often therapeutically inactive. A notable exception is
morphine-6-glucuronide, which is more potent than morphine. Glucuronidation is the most common and the most
important conjugation reaction. [Note: Drugs already possessing an –OH, –NH2, or –COOH group may enter phase
II directly and become conjugated without prior phase I metabolism (Figure 1.16).] The highly polar drug
conjugates are then excreted by the kidney or in bile.
58
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 59 ---

VI.  Drug Clearance by the Kidney
Drugs must be sufficiently polar to be eliminated from the body. Removal of drugs from the body occurs via a
number of routes; the most important is elimination through the kidney into the urine. Patients with renal
dysfunction may be unable to excrete drugs and are at risk for drug accumulation and adverse effects.
59
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 60 ---

A.  Renal elimination of a drug
A drug passes through several processes in the kidney before elimination: glomerular filtration, active tubular
secretion, and passive tubular reabsorption.
1.  Glomerular filtration
Drugs enter the kidney through renal arteries, which divide to form a glomerular capillary plexus. Free drug (not
bound to albumin) flows through the capillary slits into the Bowman space as part of the glomerular filtrate ( Figure
1.19). The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is normally about 120 mL/min/1.73m2 but may diminish significantly in
renal disease. Lipid solubility and pH do not influence the passage of drugs into the glomerular filtrate. However,
variations in GFR and protein binding of drugs do affect this process.
60
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 61 ---

Figure 1.19 Drug elimination by the kidney.
2.  Proximal tubular secretion
Drugs that were not transferred into the glomerular filtrate leave the glomeruli through efferent arterioles, which
divide to form a capillary plexus surrounding the nephric lumen in the proximal tubule. Secretion primarily occurs
in the proximal tubules by two energy-requiring active transport systems: one for anions (for example, deprotonated
61
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 62 ---

forms of weak acids) and one for cations (for example, protonated forms of weak bases). Each of these transport
systems shows low specificity and can transport many compounds. Thus, competition between drugs for these
carriers can occur within each transport system. [Note: Premature infants and neonates have an incompletely
developed tubular secretory mechanism and, thus, may retain certain drugs in the blood.]
3.  Distal tubular reabsorption
As a drug moves toward the distal convoluted tubule, its concentration increases and exceeds that of the perivascular
space. The drug, if uncharged, may diffuse out of the nephric lumen, back into the systemic circulation ( Figure
1.20). Manipulating the urine pH to increase the fraction of ionized drug in the lumen may be done to minimize the
amount of back diffusion and increase the clearance of an undesirable drug. Generally, weak acids can be eliminated
by alkalinization of the urine, whereas elimination of weak bases may be increased by acidification of the urine. This
process is called “ion trapping.” For example, a patient presenting with phenobarbital  (weak acid) overdose can be
given bicarbonate, which alkalinizes the urine and keeps the drug ionized, thereby decreasing its reabsorption.

VII.  Excretion by Other Routes
Drug excretion may also occur via the intestines, bile, lungs, and breast milk, among others. Drugs that are not
absorbed after oral administration or drugs that are secreted directly into the intestines or into bile are excreted in the
feces. The lungs are primarily involved in the elimination of anesthetic gases (for example, desflurane). Elimination
of drugs in breast milk may expose the breast-feeding infant to medications and/or metabolites being taken by the
mother and is a potential source of undesirable side effects to the infant. Excretion of most drugs into sweat, saliva,
tears, hair, and skin occurs only to a small extent. Total body clearance and drug half-life are important measures of
drug clearance that are used to optimize drug therapy and minimize toxicity.

A.  Total body clearance
The total body (systemic) clearance, CLtotal, is the sum of all clearances from the drug-metabolizing and drug-
eliminating organs. The kidney is often the major organ of excretion. The liver also contributes to drug clearance
through metabolism and/or excretion into the bile. Total clearance is calculated using the following equation:
where CLhepatic  + CLrenal are typically the most important.

--- PAGE 67 ---

B.  Clinical situations resulting in changes in drug half-life
When a patient has an abnormality that alters the half-life of a drug, adjustment in dosage is required. Patients who
may have an increase in drug half-life include those with 1) diminished renal or hepatic blood flow, for example, in
cardiogenic shock, heart failure, or hemorrhage; 2) decreased ability to extract drug from plasma, for example, in
renal disease; and 3) decreased metabolism, for example, when a concomitant drug inhibits metabolism or in hepatic
insufficiency, as with cirrhosis. These patients may require a decrease in dosage or less frequent dosing intervals. In
contrast, the half-life of a drug may be decreased by increased hepatic blood flow, decreased protein binding, or
increased metabolism. This may necessitate higher doses or more frequent dosing intervals.

VIII.  Design and Optimization of Dosage Regimen
To initiate drug therapy, the clinician must select the appropriate route of administration, dosage, and dosing
interval. Selection of a regimen depends on various patient and drug factors, including how rapidly therapeutic
levels of a drug must be achieved. Therapy may consist of a single dose of a drug, for example, a sleep-inducing
agent, such as zolpidem. More commonly, drugs are continually administered, either as an IV infusion or in IV or
oral fixed-dose/fixed-time interval regimens (for example, “one tablet every 4 hours”). Continuous or repeated
administration results in accumulation of the drug until a steady state occurs. Steady-state concentration is reached
when the rate of drug elimination is equal to the rate of drug administration, such that plasma and tissue levels
remain relatively constant.
68
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 69 ---

A.  Continuous infusion regimens
With continuous IV infusion, the rate of drug entry into the body is constant. Most drugs exhibit first-order
elimination, that is, a constant fraction of the drug is cleared per unit of time. Therefore, the rate of drug elimination
increases proportionately as the plasma concentration increases.
1.  Plasma concentration of a drug following continuous IV infusion
Following initiation of a continuous IV infusion, the plasma concentration of a drug rises until a steady state (rate of
drug elimination equals rate of drug administration) is reached, at which point the plasma concentration of the drug
remains constant.
a.  Influence of infusion rate on steady-state concentration
The steady-state plasma concentration (Css) is directly proportional to the infusion rate. For example, if the infusion
rate is doubled, the Css is doubled (Figure 1.21). Furthermore, the Css is inversely proportional to the clearance of
the drug. Thus, any factor that decreases clearance, such as liver or kidney disease, increases the Css of an infused
drug (assuming Vd remains constant). Factors that increase clearance, such as increased metabolism, decrease the
Css.
Figure 1.21 Effect of infusion rate on the steady-state concentration of drug in the
plasma. Ro = rate of drug infusion; Css = steady-state concentration.
b.  Time to reach steady-state drug concentration
The concentration of a drug rises from zero at the start of the infusion to its ultimate steady-state level, Css (Figure
1.21). The rate constant for attainment of steady state is the rate constant for total body elimination of the drug.
Thus, 50% of Css of a drug is observed after the time elapsed, since the infusion, t, is equal to t1/2, where t1/2 (or half-
69
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 70 ---

life) is the time required for the drug concentration to change by 50%. After another half-life, the drug concentration
approaches 75% of Css (Figure 1.22). The drug concentration is 87.5% of Css at 3 half-lives and 90% at 3.3 half-
lives. Thus, a drug reaches steady state in about 4 to 5 half-lives.
Figure 1.22 Rate of attainment of steady-state concentration of a drug in the plasma after
intravenous infusion.
The sole determinant of the rate that a drug achieves steady state is the half-life (t1/2) of the drug, and this rate is
influenced only by factors that affect half-life. The rate of approach to steady state is not affected by the rate of
infusion. When the infusion is stopped, the plasma concentration of a drug declines (washes out) to zero with the
same time course observed in approaching steady state (Figure 1.22).
70

--- PAGE 71 ---

B.  Fixed-dose/fixed-time regimens
Administration of a drug by fixed doses rather than by continuous infusion is often more convenient. However, fixed
doses of IV or oral medications given at fixed intervals result in time-dependent fluctuations in the circulating level
of drug, which contrasts with the smooth ascent of drug concentration with continuous infusion.
1.  Multiple IV injections
When a drug is given repeatedly at regular intervals, the plasma concentration increases until a steady state is
reached (Figure 1.23). Because most drugs are given at intervals shorter than 5 half-lives and are eliminated
exponentially with time, some drug from the first dose remains in the body when the second dose is administered,
some from the second dose remains when the third dose is given, and so forth. Therefore, the drug accumulates
until, within the dosing interval, the rate of drug elimination equals the rate of drug administration and a steady state
is achieved.
Figure 1.23 Predicted plasma concentrations of a drug given by infusion (A), twice-daily
injection (B), or once-daily injection (C). Model assumes rapid mixing in a single body
compartment and a half-life of 12 hours.
a.  Effect of dosing frequency
With repeated administration at regular intervals, the plasma concentration of a drug oscillates about a mean. Using
smaller doses at shorter intervals reduces the amplitude of fluctuations in drug concentration. However, the dosing
frequency changes neither the magnitude of Css nor the rate of achieving Css.
b.  Example of achievement of steady state using different dosage regimens
Curve B of Figure 1.23 shows the amount of drug in the body when 1 unit of a drug is administered IV and repeated
71
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 72 ---

at a dosing interval that corresponds to the half-life of the drug. At the end of the first dosing interval, 0.50 units of
drug remain from the first dose when the second dose is administered. At the end of the second dosing interval, 0.75
units are present when the third dose is given. The minimal amount of drug remaining during the dosing interval
progressively approaches a value of 1.00 unit, whereas the maximal value immediately following drug
administration progressively approaches 2.00 units. Therefore, at the steady state, 1.00 unit of drug is lost during the
dosing interval, which is exactly matched by the rate of administration. That is, the “rate in” equals the “rate out.”
As in the case for IV infusion, 90% of the steady-state value is achieved in 3.3 half-lives.
2.  Multiple oral administrations
Most drugs administered on an outpatient basis are oral medications taken at a specific dose one, two, or more times
daily. In contrast to IV injection, orally administered drugs may be absorbed slowly, and the plasma concentration of
the drug is influenced by both the rate of absorption and the rate of elimination (Figure 1.24).
Figure 1.24 Predicted plasma concentrations of a drug given by repeated oral
administrations.

C.  Optimization of dose
The goal of drug therapy is to achieve and maintain concentrations within a therapeutic response window while
minimizing toxicity and/or adverse effects. With careful titration, most drugs can achieve this goal. If the therapeutic
window (see Chapter 2) of the drug is small (for example, digoxin or lithium), extra caution should be taken in
selecting a dosage regimen, and drug levels should be monitored to ensure attainment of the therapeutic range. Drug
regimens are administered as a maintenance dose and may require a loading dose if rapid effects are warranted.
1.  Maintenance dose
Drugs are generally administered to maintain a Css within the therapeutic window. It takes 4 to 5 half-lives for a
drug to achieve Css. To achieve a given concentration, the rate of administration and the rate of elimination of the
drug are important. The dosing rate can be determined by knowing the target concentration in plasma (Cp),
clearance (CL) of the drug from the systemic circulation, and the fraction (F) absorbed (bioavailability):
2.  Loading dose
Sometimes rapid obtainment of desired plasma levels is needed (for example, in serious infections or arrhythmias).
Therefore, a “loading dose” of drug is administered to achieve the desired plasma level rapidly, followed by a
maintenance dose to maintain the steady state (Figure 1.25). In general, the loading dose can be calculated as
Figure 1.25 Accumulation of drug administered orally without a loading dose and with a
single oral loading dose administered at t = 0.
Loading dose = (Vd) × (desired steady-state plasma concentration)/F
Disadvantages of loading doses include increased risk of drug toxicity and a longer time for the plasma
concentration to fall if excess levels occur.
3.  Dose adjustment
The amount of a drug administered for a given condition is estimated based on an “average patient.” This approach
overlooks interpatient variability in pharmacokinetic parameters such as clearance and Vd, which are quite
significant in some cases. Knowledge of pharmacokinetic principles is useful in adjusting dosages to optimize
74
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 75 ---

therapy for a given patient. Monitoring drug therapy and correlating it with clinical benefits provides another tool to
individualize therapy.
For drugs with a defined therapeutic range, drug concentrations are measured, and the dosage and frequency are
adjusted to obtain the desired levels. When determining a dosage adjustment, Vd can be used to calculate the amount
of drug needed to achieve a desired plasma concentration. For example, assume a heart failure patient is not well
controlled due to inadequate plasma levels of digoxin. Suppose the concentration of digoxin in the plasma is C1 and
the desired target concentration is C2, a higher concentration. The following calculation can be used to determine
how much additional digoxin should be administered to bring the level from C1 to C2.
(Vd)(C1) = Amount of drug initially in the body
(Vd)(C2) = Amount of drug in the body needed to achieve the desired plasma concentration
The difference between the two values is the additional dosage needed, which equals Vd (C2 − C1).
Figure 1.26 shows the time course of drug concentration when treatment is started or dosing is changed.
Figure 1.26 Accumulation of drug following sustained administration and following
changes in dosing. Oral dosing was at intervals of 50% of t1/2.

following routes of administration is the most desirable for administering the antidote for the drug overdose?
A.  Intramuscular
B.  Intravenous
C.  Oral
D.  Subcutaneous
E.  Transdermal
Correct answer = B. The intravenous route of administration is the most desirable because it results in
achievement of therapeutic plasma levels of the antidote rapidly.
Drug A is a weakly basic drug with a pKa of 7.8. If administered orally, at which of the following sites of
absorption will the drug be able to readily pass through the membrane?
A.  Mouth (pH approximately 7.0)
B.  Stomach (pH of 2.5)
C.  Duodenum (pH approximately 6.1)
D.  Jejunum (pH approximately 8.0)
E.  Ileum (pH approximately 7.0)
Correct answer = D. Because Drug A is a weakly basic drug (pKa = 7.8), it will be predominantly in the
nonionized form in the jejunum (pH of 8.0). For weak bases, the nonionized form will permeate through the cell
membrane readily.
KR2250 is an investigational cholesterol-lowering agent. KR2250 has a high molecular weight and is
extensively bound to albumin. KR2250 will have a(n) _______________ apparent volume of distribution
(Vd).
A.  High
B.  Low
C.  Extremely high
D.  Normal
Correct answer = B. Because of its high molecular weight and high protein binding, KR2250 will be effectively
trapped within the plasma (vascular) compartment and will have a low apparent volume of distribution.
A 40-year-old male patient (70 kg) was recently diagnosed with infection involving methicillin-resistant S.
aureus. He received 2000 mg of vancomycin as an IV loading dose. The peak plasma concentration of
vancomycin was 28.5 mg/L. The apparent volume of distribution is:
A.  1 L/kg
B.  7 L/kg
C.  10 L/kg
D.  14 L/kg
E.  70 L/kg
Correct answer = A. Vd = dose/C = 2000 mg/28.5 mg/L = 70.1 L. Because the patient is 70 kg, the apparent
volume of distribution in L/kg will be approximately 1 L/kg (70.1 L/70 kg).
A 55-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of seizures. She has a history of renal
disease and currently undergoes dialysis. She receives an intravenous infusion of antiseizure Drug X. Which
of the following is likely to be observed with use of Drug X in this patient?
Correct answer = D. Because the patient has a renal disorder, she may not be able to excrete the drug effectively.
Therefore, the half-life of Drug X will be prolonged. As the half-life is prolonged, the dosage must be reduced so
the patient will not have serious toxic effects of Drug X. 76

1.10A 68-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department for treatment of a myocardial infarction. She
is currently taking clopidogrel (antiplatelet agent) and aspirin daily, as well as omeprazole (potent CYP
inhibitor) for heartburn. Which of the following is the most likely contributor to her myocardial infarction
today?
A.  Reduced antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel due to aspirin
B.  Reduced antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel due to omeprazole
C.  Hypersensitivity reaction due to clopidogrel
D.  Increased antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel due to omeprazole
E.  Increased antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel due to aspirin
Correct answer = B. Clopidogrel is a prodrug and requires CYP2C19 activity for conversion to an active
metabolite. Because omeprazole is a potent CYP inhibitor, clopidogrel is not converted to the active metabolite,
and therefore the antiplatelet activity is reduced, potentially contributing to myocardial infarction.
Which of the following reactions represents Phase II of drug metabolism?
A.  Amidation
B.  Hydrolysis
C.  Oxidation
D.  Reduction
E.  Sulfation
Correct answer = E. Phase II metabolic reactions involve conjugation reactions to make phase I metabolites more
polar. Sulfation and glucuronidation are the most common phase II conjugation reactions.
A pharmacokinetic study of a new antihypertensive drug is being conducted in healthy human volunteers.
The half-life of the drug after administration by continuous intravenous infusion is 12 hours. Which of the
following best approximates the time for the drug to reach steady state?
A.  24 hours
B.  48 hours
C.  72 hours
D.  120 hours
E.  240 hours
Correct answer = B. A drug will reach steady state in about 4 to 5 half-lives. Therefore, for this drug with a half-
life of 12 hours, the approximate time to reach steady state will be 48 hours.
A 64-year-old female patient (60 kg) is treated with experimental Drug A for type 2 diabetes. Drug A is
available as tablets with an oral bioavailability of 90%. If the Vd is 2 L/kg and the desired steady-state
plasma concentration is 3.0 mg/L, which of the following is the most appropriate oral loading dose of Drug
A?
A.  6 mg
B.  6.66 mg
C.  108 mg
D.  360 mg
E.  400 mg
Correct answer = E. For oral dosing, loading dose = [(Vd) × (desired steady-state plasma concentration)/F]. The
Vd in this case is corrected to the patient’s weight is 120 L. The F value is 0.9 (because bioavailability is 90%,
that is, 90/100 = 0.9). Thus, loading dose = (120 L × 3.0 mg/L)/0.9 = 400 mg.
A 74-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for treatment of heart failure. He received 160 mcg of
digoxin intravenously, and the plasma digoxin level was 0.4 ng/mL. If the desired plasma concentration of
digoxin for optimal therapeutic activity in heart failure is 1.2 ng/mL, and the patient has an estimated Vd of
400 L, calculate the additional dose of digoxin needed for this patient to achieve the desired plasma
concentration.
A.  128 mcg
B.  160 mcg
C.  320 mcg
D.  480 mcg
E.  640 mcg
Correct answer = C. The additional dosage of digoxin needed to achieve the desired plasma concentration can be
calculated using the equation Vd (C2 – C1). C1 is the current plasma concentration (0.4 ng/mL) and C2 is the
desired plasma concentration (1.2 ng/mL). Therefore, the additional dosage of digoxin is [400 L × (1.2 – 0.4)
ng/mL)] = 320 mcg.77

Drug–Receptor Interactions and Pharmacodynamics

--- PAGE 80 ---

I.  Overview
Pharmacodynamics describes the actions of a drug on the body. Most drugs exert effects, both beneficial and
harmful, by interacting with specialized target macromolecules called receptors, which are present on or in the cell.
The drug–receptor complex initiates alterations in biochemical and/or molecular activity of a cell by a process called
signal transduction (Figure 2.1).
Figure 2.1 The recognition of a drug by a receptor triggers a biologic response.

II.  Signal Transduction
Drugs act as signals, and receptors act as signal detectors. A drug is termed an “agonist” if it binds to a site on a
receptor protein and activates it to initiate a series of reactions that ultimately result in a specific intracellular
response. “Second messenger” or effector molecules are part of the cascade of events that translates agonist binding
into a cellular response.
82
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 83 ---

A.  The drug–receptor complex
Cells have many different types of receptors, each of which is specific for a particular agonist and produces a unique
response. Cardiac cell membranes, for example, contain β-adrenergic receptors that bind and respond to epinephrine
or norepinephrine. Cardiac cells also contain muscarinic receptors that bind and respond to acetylcholine. These two
receptor populations dynamically interact to control the heart’s vital functions.
The magnitude of the cellular response is proportional to the number of drug–receptor complexes. This concept
is conceptually similar to the formation of complexes between enzyme and substrate and shares many common
features, such as specificity of the receptor for a given agonist. Although much of this chapter centers on the
interaction of drugs with specific receptors, it is important to know that not all drugs exert effects by interacting with
a receptor. Antacids, for instance, chemically neutralize excess gastric acid, thereby reducing stomach upset.
83
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 84 ---

B.  Receptor states
Receptors exist in at least two states, inactive (R) and active (R*), that are in reversible equilibrium with one
another, usually favoring the inactive state. Binding of agonists causes the equilibrium to shift from R to R* to
produce a biologic effect. Antagonists are drugs that bind to the receptor but do not increase the fraction of R*,
instead stabilizing the fraction of R. Some drugs (partial agonists) shift the equilibrium from R to R*, but the
fraction of R* is less than that caused by an agonist. The magnitude of biological effect is directly related to the
fraction of R*. In summary, agonists, antagonists, and partial agonists are examples of molecules or ligands that
bind to the activation site on the receptor and can affect the fraction of R*.

--- PAGE 85 ---

C.  Major receptor families
A receptor is defined as any biologic molecule to which a drug binds and produces a measurable response. Thus,
enzymes, nucleic acids, and structural proteins can act as receptors for drugs or endogenous agonists. However, the
richest sources of receptors are membrane-bound proteins that transduce extracellular signals into intracellular
responses. These receptors may be divided into four families: 1) ligand-gated ion channels, 2) G protein–coupled
receptors, 3) enzyme-linked receptors, and 4) intracellular receptors (Figure 2.2). Generally, hydrophilic ligands
interact with receptors that are found on the cell surface ( Figure 2.2A, B, C ). In contrast, hydrophobic ligands enter
cells through the lipid bilayers of the cell membrane to interact with receptors found inside cells (Figure 2.2D).
Figure 2.2 Transmembrane signaling mechanisms. A. Ligand binds to the extracellular
domain of a ligand-gated channel. B. Ligand binds to a domain of a transmembrane
receptor, which is coupled to a G protein. C. Ligand binds to the extracellular domain of
a receptor that activates a kinase enzyme. D. Lipid-soluble ligand diffuses across the
membrane to interact with its intracellular receptor. R = inactive protein.
1.  Transmembrane ligand-gated ion channels
The extracellular portion of ligand-gated ion channels contains the drug-binding site. This site regulates the opening
of the pore through which ions can flow across cell membranes (Figure 2.2A). The channel is usually closed until
the receptor is activated by an agonist, which opens the channel for a few milliseconds. Depending on the ion
conducted through these channels, these receptors mediate diverse functions, including neurotransmission and
muscle contraction. For example, stimulation of the nicotinic receptor by acetylcholine opens a channel that allows
sodium influx and potassium outflux across the cell membranes of neurons or muscle cells. This change in ionic
concentrations across the membrane generates an action potential in a neuron and contraction in skeletal and cardiac
muscle. On the other hand, agonist stimulation of the A subtype of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor
increases chloride influx, resulting in hyperpolarization of neurons and less chance of generating an action potential.
Drug-binding sites are also found on many voltage-gated ion channels where they can regulate channel function. For
example, local anesthetics bind to the voltage-gated sodium channel, inhibiting sodium influx and decreasing
neuronal conduction.
2.  Transmembrane G protein–coupled receptors
The extracellular portion of this receptor contains the ligand-binding site, and the intracellular portion interacts
(when activated) with a G protein. There are many kinds of G proteins (for example, Gs, Gi, and Gq), but all types
are composed of three protein subunits. The α subunit binds guanosine triphosphate (GTP), and the β and γ subunits
anchor the G protein in the cell membrane (Figure 2.3). Binding of an agonist to the receptor increases GTP binding
to the α subunit, causing dissociation of the α-GTP complex from the βγ complex. The α and βγ subunits are then
free to interact with specific cellular effectors, usually an enzyme or an ion channel, that cause further actions within
the cell. These responses usually last several seconds to minutes. Often, the activated effectors produce “second
messenger” molecules that further activate other effectors in the cell, causing a signal cascade effect.

Figure 2.3 The recognition of chemical signals by G protein–coupled membrane
receptors affects the activity of adenylyl cyclase. PPi = inorganic pyrophosphate.
A common effector, activated by Gs and inhibited by Gi, is adenylyl cyclase, which produces the second messenger
cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The effector phospholipase C, when activated by Gq, generates two
second messengers: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). DAG and cAMP activate specific
protein kinases within the cell, leading to a myriad of physiological effects. IP3 increases intracellular calcium
concentration, which in turn activates other protein kinases.
3.  Enzyme-linked receptors
This family of receptors undergoes conformational changes when activated by a ligand, resulting in increased
intracellular enzyme activity (Figure 2.4). This response lasts for minutes to hours. The most common enzyme-
linked receptors (for example, growth factors and insulin) possess tyrosine kinase activity. When activated, the
receptor phosphorylates tyrosine residues on itself and other specific proteins ( Figure 2.4). Phosphorylation can
substantially modify the structure of the target protein, thereby acting as a molecular switch. For example, the
phosphorylated insulin receptor in turn phosphorylates other proteins that now become active. Thus, enzyme-linked
receptors often cause a signal cascade effect like that caused by G protein–coupled receptors.

Figure 2.4 Insulin receptor.
4.  Intracellular receptors
The fourth family of receptors differs considerably from the other three in that the receptor is entirely intracellular,
and, therefore, the ligand (for example, steroid hormones) must have sufficient lipid solubility to diffuse into the cell
to interact with the receptor (Figure 2.5). The primary targets of activated intracellular receptors are transcription
factors in the cell nucleus that regulate gene expression. The activation or inactivation of transcription factors alters
the transcription of DNA into RNA and subsequently translation of RNA into proteins. The effect of drugs or
endogenous ligands that activate intracellular receptors takes hours to days to occur. Other targets of intracellular
ligands are structural proteins, enzymes, RNA, and ribosomes. For example, tubulin is the target of antineoplastic
agents such as paclitaxel  (see Chapter 35), the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase is the target of antimicrobials such as
trimethoprim (see Chapter 31), and the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome is the target of macrolide antibiotics
such as erythromycin (see Chapter 30).

D.  Characteristics of signal transduction
Signal transduction has two important features: 1) the ability to amplify small signals and 2) mechanisms to protect
the cell from excessive stimulation.
1.  Signal amplification
A characteristic of G protein–linked and enzyme-linked receptors is the ability to amplify signal intensity and
duration via the signal cascade effect. Additionally, activated G proteins persist for a longer duration than does the
original agonist–receptor complex. The binding of albuterol , for example, may only exist for a few milliseconds, but
the subsequent activated G proteins may last for hundreds of milliseconds. Further prolongation and amplification of
the initial signal are mediated by the interaction between G proteins and their respective intracellular targets.
Because of this amplification, only a fraction of the total receptors for a specific ligand may need to be occupied to
elicit a maximal response. Systems that exhibit this behavior are said to have spare receptors. About 99% of insulin
receptors are “spare,” providing an immense functional reserve that ensures that adequate amounts of glucose enter
the cell. On the other hand, only about 5% to 10% of the total β-adrenoceptors in the heart are spare. Therefore, little
functional reserve exists in the failing heart, because most receptors must be occupied to obtain maximum
contractility.
2.  Desensitization and down-regulation of receptors
Repeated or continuous administration of an agonist or antagonist often leads to changes in the responsiveness of the
receptor. The receptor may become desensitized due to too much agonist stimulation (Figure 2.6), resulting in a
diminished response. This phenomenon, called tachyphylaxis, is often due to phosphorylation that renders receptors
unresponsive to the agonist. In addition, receptors may be internalized within the cell, making them unavailable for
further agonist interaction (down-regulation). Some receptors, particularly ion channels, require a finite time
following stimulation before they can be activated again. During this recovery phase, unresponsive receptors are
said to be “refractory.” Repeated exposure of a receptor to an antagonist, on the other hand, results in up-regulation
of receptors, in which receptor reserves are inserted into the membrane, increasing the number of receptors
available. Up-regulation of receptors can make cells more sensitive to agonists and/or more resistant to effects of the
antagonist.

III.  Dose–Response Relationships
Agonist drugs mimic the action of the endogenous ligand for the receptor (for example, isoproterenol  mimics
norepinephrine on β1 receptors of the heart). The magnitude of the drug effect depends on receptor sensitivity to the
drug and the drug concentration at the receptor site, which, in turn, is determined by both the dose of drug
administered and by the drug’s pharmacokinetic profile, such as rate of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and
elimination.

--- PAGE 95 ---

A.  Graded dose–response relationship
As the concentration of a drug increases, its pharmacologic effect also gradually increases until all the receptors are
occupied (the maximum effect). Plotting the magnitude of response against increasing doses of a drug produces a
graded dose–response curve that has the general shape depicted in Figure 2.7A. Two important drug characteristics,
potency and efficacy, can be determined by graded dose–response curves.
Figure 2.7 The effect of dose on the magnitude of pharmacologic response. Panel A is a
linear plot. Panel B  is a semilogarithmic plot of the same data. EC50 = drug dose causing
50% of maximal response.
1.  Potency
Potency is a measure of the amount of drug necessary to produce an effect. The concentration of drug producing
50% of the maximum effect (EC50) is often used to determine potency. In Figure 2.7, the EC50 for Drugs A and B
indicate that Drug A is more potent than Drug B, because a lesser amount of Drug A is needed to obtain 50% effect.
Therapeutic preparations of drugs reflect their potency. For example, candesartan and irbesartan are angiotensin
receptor blockers used to treat hypertension. The therapeutic dose range for candesartan is 4 to 32 mg, as compared
to 75 to 300 mg for irbesartan. Therefore, candesartan is more potent than irbesartan (it has a lower EC50 value).
Since the range of drug concentrations that cause from 1% to 99% of maximal response usually spans several orders
of magnitude, semilogarithmic plots are used to graph the complete range of doses. As shown in Figure 2.7B , the
curves become sigmoidal in shape, which simplifies the interpretation of the dose–response curve.
2.  Efficacy
Efficacy is the magnitude of response a drug causes when it interacts with a receptor. Efficacy is dependent on the
number of drug–receptor complexes formed and the intrinsic activity of the drug (its ability to activate the receptor
and cause a cellular response). Maximal efficacy of a drug (Emax) assumes that the drug occupies all receptors, and
no increase in response is observed in response to higher concentrations of drug. The maximal response differs
between full and partial agonists, even when the drug occupies 100% of the receptors. Similarly, even though an
antagonist occupies 100% of the receptor sites, no receptor activation results and Emax is zero. Efficacy is a more
clinically useful characteristic than potency, since a drug with greater efficacy is more therapeutically beneficial than
one that is more potent. Figure 2.8 shows the response to drugs of differing potency and efficacy.

efficacy. EC50 = drug dose that shows 50% of maximal response.

--- PAGE 97 ---

B.  Effect of drug concentration on receptor binding
The quantitative relationship between drug concentration and receptor occupancy applies the law of mass action to
the kinetics of the binding of drug and receptor molecules:
By making the assumption that the binding of one drug molecule does not alter the binding of subsequent molecules
and applying the law of mass action, we can mathematically express the relationship between the percentage (or
fraction) of bound receptors and the drug concentration:
  (1)
where [D] = the concentration of free drug, [DR] = the concentration of bound drug, [Rt] = the total number of
receptors, and Kd = the equilibrium dissociation constant for the drug from the receptor. The value of Kd can be used
to determine the affinity of a drug for its receptor. Affinity describes the strength of the interaction (binding)
between a ligand and its receptor. The higher the Kd value, the weaker the interaction and the lower the affinity, and
vice versa. Equation (1) defines a curve that has the shapes shown in Figure 2.9 when plotted against drug
concentration (Panel A) or log drug concentration (Panel B). As the concentration of free drug increases, the ratio of
the concentrations of bound receptors to total receptors approaches unity, thereby producing the maximal effect.
Thus, it is not surprising that the curves shown in Figure 2.9 and those representing the relationship between dose
and effect (Figure 2.7) are similar.
Figure 2.9 The effect of dose on the magnitude of drug binding.

--- PAGE 99 ---

C.  Relationship of drug binding to pharmacologic effect
The law of mass action can be applied to drug concentration and response providing the following assumptions are
met: 1) The magnitude of the response is proportional to the amount of receptors occupied by drug, 2) the Emax
occurs when all receptors are bound, and 3) one molecule of drug binds to only one molecule of receptor. In this
case,
  (2)
where [E] = the effect of the drug at concentration [D] and [Emax] = the maximal effect of the drug.
Thus, it follows that if a specific population of receptors is vital for mediating a physiological effect, the affinity
of an agonist for binding to those receptors should be related to the potency of that drug for causing that
physiological effect. Many drugs and most neurotransmitters can bind to more than one type of receptor, thereby
causing both desired therapeutic effects and undesired adverse effects. In order to establish a relationship between
drug occupation of a particular receptor subtype and the corresponding biological response to that drug, correlation
curves of receptor affinity and drug potency are often constructed (Figure 2.10).
Figure 2.10 Correlation of drug affinity for receptor binding and potency for causing a
physiological effect. A positive correlation should exist between the affinity (Kd value) of
a drug for binding to a specific receptor subtype and the potency (EC50 value) of that
drug to cause physiological responses mediated by that receptor population. For example,
many drugs have affinity for both α1 and β2 adrenergic receptors. The circled letters in
the figure represent agonists with varying affinities for α1 and β2 receptors. However,
from the data provided, it becomes clear that α1 receptors only mediate changes in blood
pressure, while β2 receptors only mediate changes in bronchodilation.

IV.  Intrinsic Activity
As mentioned above, an agonist binds to a receptor and produces a biologic response based on the concentration of
the agonist, its affinity for the receptor and, hence, the fraction of occupied receptors. However, the intrinsic activity
of a drug further determines its ability to fully or partially activate the receptors. Drugs may be categorized
according to their intrinsic activity and resulting Emax values.
100
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 101 ---

A.  Full agonists
If a drug binds to a receptor and produces a maximal biologic response that mimics the response to the endogenous
ligand, it is a full agonist (Figure 2.11). Full agonists bind to a receptor, stabilizing the receptor in its active state and
are said to have an intrinsic activity of one. All full agonists for a receptor population should produce the same Emax.
For example, phenylephrine is a full agonist at α1-adrenoceptors, because it produces the same Emax as the
endogenous ligand, norepinephrine. Upon binding to α1-adrenoceptors on vascular smooth muscle, both
norepinephrine and phenylephrine stabilize the receptor in its active state, thereby increasing Gq activation.
Activation of Gq increases intracellular Ca2+, causing interaction of actin and myosin filaments and shortening of the
muscle cells. The diameter of the arteriole decreases, causing an increase in resistance to blood flow through the
vessel and an increase in blood pressure. Thus, effects of agonists on intracellular molecules, cells, tissues, and
intact organisms are all attributable to interaction of the drug with the receptor. For full agonists, the dose–response
curves for receptor binding and each of the biological responses should be comparable.

activity.

--- PAGE 103 ---

103
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 104 ---

B.  Partial agonists
Partial agonists have intrinsic activities greater than zero but less than one ( Figure 2.11). Even when all the receptors
are occupied, partial agonists cannot produce the same Emax as a full agonist. Even so, a partial agonist may have an
affinity that is greater than, less than, or equivalent to that of a full agonist. A partial agonist may also act as a partial
antagonist of a full agonist (Figure 2.12). As the number of receptors occupied by the partial agonist increases, the
number of receptors that can be occupied by the full agonist decreases and therefore Emax would decrease until it
reached the Emax of the partial agonist. This potential of partial agonists to act as both an agonist and antagonist may
have therapeutic utility. For example, aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic, is a partial agonist at selected
dopamine receptors. Overactive dopaminergic pathways tend to be inhibited by aripiprazole, whereas underactive
pathways are stimulated. This might explain the ability of aripiprazole to improve symptoms of schizophrenia, with
a small risk of causing extrapyramidal adverse effects (see Chapter 11).

106
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 107 ---

C.  Inverse agonists
Typically, unbound receptors are inactive and require interaction with an agonist to assume an active conformation.
However, some receptors show a spontaneous conversion from R to R* in the absence of an agonist. Inverse
agonists, unlike full agonists, stabilize the inactive R form and cause R* to convert to R. This decreases the number
of activated receptors to below that observed in the absence of drug (Figure 2.11). Thus, inverse agonists have an
intrinsic activity less than zero, reverse the activation state of receptors, and exert the opposite pharmacological
effect of agonists.
107
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 108 ---

D.  Antagonists
Antagonists bind to a receptor with high affinity but possess zero intrinsic activity. An antagonist has no effect on
biological function in the absence of an agonist, but can decrease the effect of an agonist when present. Antagonism
may occur either by blocking the drug’s ability to bind to the receptor or by blocking its ability to activate the
receptor.
1.  Competitive antagonists
If the antagonist binds to the same site on the receptor as the agonist in a reversible manner, it is “competitive.” A
competitive antagonist interferes with an agonist binding to its receptor and maintains the receptor in its inactive
state. For example, the antihypertensive drug terazosin competes with the endogenous ligand norepinephrine at α1-
adrenoceptors, thus decreasing vascular smooth muscle tone and reducing blood pressure. However, increasing the
concentration of agonist relative to antagonist can overcome this inhibition. Thus, competitive antagonists
characteristically shift the agonist dose–response curve to the right (increased EC50) without affecting Emax (Figure
2.13).
Figure 2.13 Effects of drug antagonists. EC50 = drug dose that shows 50% of maximal
response.
2.  Irreversible antagonists
Irreversible antagonists bind covalently to the active site of the receptor, thereby permanently reducing the number
of receptors available to the agonist. An irreversible antagonist causes a downward shift of the Emax, with no shift of
EC50 values (Figure 2.13). In contrast to competitive antagonists, addition of more agonist does not overcome the
effect of irreversible antagonists. Thus, irreversible antagonists and allosteric antagonists (see below) are both
considered noncompetitive antagonists. A fundamental difference between competitive and noncompetitive
antagonists is that competitive antagonists reduce agonist potency (increase EC50) and noncompetitive antagonists
reduce agonist efficacy (decrease Emax).
3.  Allosteric antagonists
An allosteric antagonist binds to a site (allosteric site) other than the agonist-binding site and prevents receptor
activation by the agonist. This type of antagonist also causes a downward shift of the Emax of an agonist, with no
108
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 109 ---

change in the EC50 value. An example of an allosteric agonist is picrotoxin, which binds to the inside of the GABA-
controlled chloride channel. When picrotoxin binds inside the channel, no chloride can pass through the channel,
even when GABA fully occupies the receptor.
4.  Functional antagonism
An antagonist may act at a completely separate receptor, initiating effects that are functionally opposite those of the
agonist. A classic example is the functional antagonism by epinephrine to histamine-induced bronchoconstriction.
Histamine binds to H1 histamine receptors on bronchial smooth muscle, causing bronchoconstriction of the
bronchial tree. Epinephrine is an agonist at β2-adrenoceptors on bronchial smooth muscle, which causes the muscles
to relax. This functional antagonism is also known as “physiologic antagonism.”

--- PAGE 110 ---

V.  Quantal Dose–Response Relationships
Another important dose–response relationship is that between the dose of the drug and the proportion of a
population of patients that responds to it. These responses are known as quantal responses, because, for any
individual, either the effect occurs or it does not. Graded responses can be transformed to quantal responses by
designating a predetermined level of the graded response as the point at which a response occurs or not. For
example, a quantal dose–response relationship can be determined in a population for the antihypertensive drug
atenolol . A positive response is defined as a fall of at least 5 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure. Quantal dose–
response curves are useful for determining doses to which most of the population responds. They have similar
shapes as log dose–response curves, and the ED50 is the drug dose that causes a therapeutic response in half of the
population.
110
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 111 ---

A.  Therapeutic index
The therapeutic index (TI) of a drug is the ratio of the dose that produces toxicity in half the population (TD50) to the
dose that produces a clinically desired or effective response (ED50) in half the population:
The TI is a measure of a drug’s safety, because a larger value indicates a wide margin between doses that are
effective and doses that are toxic.
111
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 112 ---

B.  Clinical usefulness of the therapeutic index
The TI of a drug is determined using drug trials and accumulated clinical experience. These usually reveal a range of
effective doses and a different (sometimes overlapping) range of toxic doses. Although high TI values are required
for most drugs, some drugs with low therapeutic indices are routinely used to treat serious diseases. In these cases,
the risk of experiencing adverse effects is not as great as the risk of leaving the disease untreated. Figure 2.14 shows
the responses to warfarin, an oral anticoagulant with a low TI, and penicillin, an antimicrobial drug with a large TI.
Figure 2.14 Cumulative percentage of patients responding to plasma levels of warfarin
and penicillin.
112
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 113 ---

1.  Warfarin (example of a drug with a small therapeutic index)
As the dose of warfarin is increased, a greater fraction of the patients respond (for this drug, the desired response is
a two- to threefold increase in the international normalized ratio [INR]) until, eventually, all patients respond (Figure
2.14A). However, at higher doses of warfarin, anticoagulation resulting in hemorrhage occurs in a small percent of
patients. Agents with a low TI (that is, drugs for which dose is critically important) are those drugs for which
bioavailability critically alters the therapeutic effects (see Chapter 1).
2.  Penicillin (example of a drug with a large therapeutic index)
For drugs such as penicillin (Figure 2.14B ), it is safe and common to give doses in excess of that which is minimally
required to achieve a desired response without the risk of adverse effects. In this case, bioavailability does not
critically alter the therapeutic or clinical effects.

2.6Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
Which of the following best describes how a drug that acts as an agonist at the A subtype of GABA receptors
affects signal transduction in a neuron?
A.  Activation of this receptor subtype alters transcription of DNA in the nucleus of the neuron.
B.  Activation of this receptor subtype opens ion channels that allow sodium to enter cells and increases the chance
of generating an action potential.
C.  Activation of this receptor subtype opens ion channels that allow chloride to enter cells and decreases the chance
of generating an action potential.
D.  Activation of this receptor subtype results in G protein activation and increased intracellular second messenger
levels.
Correct answer = C. The GABA-A receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel selective for chloride. Agonists for the
GABA-A receptor increase opening of channels, resulting in chloride entry into the neuron, hyperpolarization,
and decreased action potential events.
If 1 mg of lorazepam produces the same anxiolytic response as 10 mg of diazepam, which is correct?
A.  Lorazepam is more potent than is diazepam.
B.  Lorazepam is more efficacious than is diazepam.
C.  Lorazepam is a full agonist, and diazepam is a partial agonist.
D.  Lorazepam is a better drug to take for anxiety than is diazepam.
Correct answer = A. A drug that causes the same effect at a lower dose is more potent. B and C are incorrect
because without information about the maximal effect of these drugs, no conclusions can be made about efficacy
or intrinsic activity. D is incorrect because the maximal response obtained is often more important than the
amount of drug needed to achieve it.
If 10 mg of oxycodone produces a greater analgesic response than does aspirin at any dose, which is correct?
A.  Oxycodone is more efficacious than is aspirin.
B.  Oxycodone is less potent than is aspirin.
C.  Aspirin is a full agonist, and oxycodone is a partial agonist.
D.  Oxycodone and aspirin act on the same drug target.
Correct answer = A. Drugs with greater response at maximally effective concentrations are more efficacious than
drugs with a lower maximal response. Choice B is incorrect since no information is given about the half maximal
concentrations of either drug. Choices C and D are incorrect since it is not known if both drugs bind to the same
receptor population.
In the presence of propranolol, a higher concentration of epinephrine is required to elicit full antiasthmatic
activity. Propranolol has no effect on asthma symptoms. Which is correct regarding these medications?
A.  Epinephrine is less efficacious than is propranolol.
B.  Epinephrine is a full agonist, and propranolol is a partial agonist.
C.  Epinephrine is an agonist, and propranolol is a competitive antagonist.
D.  Epinephrine is an agonist, and propranolol is a noncompetitive antagonist.
Correct answer = C. Since propranolol decreases the effect of epinephrine but the inhibition can be overcome by
giving a higher dose of epinephrine, propranolol must be a competitive antagonist. If D were correct, even very
high concentrations of epinephrine would not be able to elicit a maximal effect in the presence of propranolol.
Since propranolol has no effect by itself, A and B are incorrect.
In the presence of picrotoxin, diazepam is less efficacious at causing sedation, regardless of the dose.
Picrotoxin has no sedative effect, even at the highest dose. Which of the following is correct regarding these
agents?
A.  Picrotoxin is a competitive antagonist.
B.  Picrotoxin is a noncompetitive antagonist.
C.  Diazepam is less efficacious than is picrotoxin.
D.  Diazepam is less potent than is picrotoxin.
Correct answer = B. Since picrotoxin decreases the maximal effect of diazepam regardless of the diazepam dose,
it is a noncompetitive antagonist. Picrotoxin has no efficacy alone, so C is incorrect. No information is provided
about potency of either drug.
Haloperidol, chlorpromazine, and clozapine are antipsychotic medications that bind to the D2 subtype of
dopamine receptors, with a binding affinity of haloperidol > chlorpromazine > clozapine. Which statement
would have to be correct to conclude that the mechanism of antipsychotic effects for these drugs is via
binding to D2 receptors?114
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 115 ---

2.7
2.8
2.9
2.10A.  Haloperidol should have the lowest potency of the three antipsychotic drugs.
B.  D2 receptor binding should also be related to the potency of these drugs in causing Parkinson’s-like adverse
effects.
C.  A positive correlation should exist between the affinity of these drugs to bind to D2 receptors and their potency
for antipsychotic actions.
D.  Clozapine would have to be more potent than chlorpromazine for decreasing psychosis.
Correct answer = C. To conclude that the mechanism of antipsychotic effect for these drugs is via binding to D2
receptors, there should be a positive correlation between the affinity of the drugs for D2 receptors and their
potency for antipsychotic actions. Haloperidol should have the highest antipsychotic potency and clozapine the
lowest. There is no guarantee the therapeutic effects and adverse effects are mediated by the same receptor
population; therefore, a different correlation may exist for the adverse effects and D2 receptor affinity.
If there were spare β1-adrenergic receptors on cardiac muscle cells, which statement would be correct?
A.  The number of spare β1-adrenergic receptors determines the size of the maximum effect of the agonist
epinephrine.
B.  Spare β1 adrenergic receptors make the cardiac tissue less sensitive to epinephrine.
C.  A maximal effect of epinephrine is seen when only a portion of β1 adrenergic receptors are occupied.
D.  Spare receptors are active even in the absence of epinephrine.
Correct answer = C. Only a fraction of the total receptors need to be bound to elicit a maximum cellular response
when spare receptors are present. The other choices do not accurately describe the effects of having spare
receptors.
Which of the following up-regulates postsynaptic α1-adrenergic receptors?
A.  Daily use of amphetamine that causes release of norepinephrine
B.  A disease that causes an increase in the activity of norepinephrine neurons
C.  Daily use of phenylephrine, an α1 receptor agonist
D.  Daily use of prazosin, an α1 receptor antagonist
Correct answer = D. Up-regulation of receptors occurs when receptor activation is lower than normal, such as
when the receptor is continuously exposed to an antagonist for that receptor. Down-regulation of receptors occurs
when receptor activation is greater than normal because of continuous exposure to an agonist, as described in A,
B, and C.
Methylphenidate helps patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) maintain attention and
perform better at school or work, with an ED50 of 10 mg. However, methylphenidate can also cause
significant nausea at higher doses (TD50 = 30 mg). Which is correct regarding methylphenidate?
A.  The therapeutic index of methylphenidate is 3.
B.  The therapeutic index of methylphenidate is 0.3.
C.  Methylphenidate is more potent at causing nausea than treating ADHD.
D.  Methylphenidate is more efficacious at causing nausea than treating ADHD.
Correct answer = A. Therapeutic index is calculated by dividing TD50 by ED50 (30/10), making B incorrect. C is
incorrect because methylphenidate is more potent at treating ADHD (it takes a lower dose) than causing nausea.
D. No information about efficacy is provided.
Which is correct concerning the safety of using warfarin (with a small therapeutic index) versus penicillin
(with a large therapeutic index)?
A.  Warfarin is a safer drug because it has a low therapeutic index.
B.  Warfarin treatment has a high chance of resulting in dangerous adverse effects if bioavailability is altered.The
high therapeutic index makes penicillin a safe drug for all patients.
D.  Penicillin treatment has a high chance of causing dangerous adverse effects if bioavailability is altered.
Correct answer = B. Agents with a low TI (that is, drugs for which dose is critically important) are those drugs for
which bioavailability critically alters the therapeutic and adverse effects. A is incorrect, because a drug with a low
TI is not generally considered to be safe. C is incorrect because a high TI does not ensure safety across the entire
patient population. D is incorrect because the high TI makes it unlikely that bioavailability alters the incidence of
therapeutic or adverse effects.115

The Autonomic Nervous System

I.  Overview
The autonomic nervous system (ANS), along with the endocrine system, coordinates the regulation and integration
of bodily functions. The endocrine system sends signals to target tissues by varying the levels of blood-borne
hormones. By contrast, the nervous system exerts effects by the rapid transmission of electrical impulses over nerve
fibers that terminate at effector cells, which specifically respond to the release of neuromediator substances. Drugs
that produce their primary therapeutic effect by mimicking or altering the functions of the ANS are called autonomic
drugs and are discussed in the following four chapters. The autonomic agents act either by stimulating portions of
the ANS or by blocking the action of the autonomic nerves. This chapter outlines the fundamental physiology of the
ANS and describes the role of neurotransmitters in the communication between extracellular events and chemical
changes within the cell.
118

--- PAGE 119 ---

I.  Introduction to the Nervous System
The nervous system is divided into two anatomical divisions: the central nervous system (CNS), which is composed
of the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system, which includes neurons located outside the brain
and spinal cord—that is, any nerves that enter or leave the CNS (Figure 3.1). The peripheral nervous system is
subdivided into the efferent and afferent divisions. The efferent neurons carry signals away from the brain and spinal
cord to the peripheral tissues, and the afferent neurons bring information from the periphery to the CNS. Afferent
neurons provide sensory input to modulate the function of the efferent division through reflex arcs or neural
pathways that mediate a reflex action.
Figure 3.1 Organization of the nervous system.
119

--- PAGE 120 ---

A.  Functional divisions within the nervous system
The efferent portion of the peripheral nervous system is further divided into two major functional subdivisions: the
somatic nervous system and the ANS (Figure 3.1). The somatic efferent neurons are involved in the voluntary
control of functions such as contraction of the skeletal muscles essential for locomotion. The ANS, conversely,
regulates the everyday requirements of vital bodily functions without the conscious participation of the mind.
Because of the involuntary nature of the ANS as well as its functions, it is also known as the visceral, vegetative, or
involuntary nervous system. It is composed of efferent neurons that innervate visceral smooth muscle, cardiac
muscle, vasculature, and the exocrine glands, thereby controlling digestion, cardiac output, blood flow, and
glandular secretions.

--- PAGE 121 ---

B.  Anatomy of the ANS
1.  Efferent neurons
The ANS carries nerve impulses from the CNS to the effector organs through two types of efferent neurons: the
preganglionic neurons and the postganglionic neurons ( Figure 3.2). The cell body of the first nerve cell, the
preganglionic neuron, is located within the CNS. The preganglionic neurons emerge from the brainstem or spinal
cord and make a synaptic connection in ganglia (an aggregation of nerve cell bodies located in the peripheral
nervous system). The ganglia function as relay stations between the preganglionic neuron and the second nerve cell,
the postganglionic neuron. The cell body of the postganglionic neuron originates in the ganglion. It is generally
nonmyelinated and terminates on effector organs, such as visceral smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and the exocrine
glands.
121

--- PAGE 122 ---

Figure 3.2 Efferent neurons of the autonomic nervous system.
2.  Afferent neurons
The afferent neurons (fibers) of the ANS are important in the reflex regulation of this system (for example, by
sensing pressure in the carotid sinus and aortic arch) and in signaling the CNS to influence the efferent branch of the
system to respond.
3.  Sympathetic neurons
The efferent ANS is divided into the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems, as well as the enteric
nervous system (Figure 3.1). Anatomically, the sympathetic and the parasympathetic neurons originate in the CNS
and emerge from two different spinal cord regions (Figure 3.3). The preganglionic neurons of the sympathetic122
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 123 ---

system come from the thoracic and lumbar regions (T1 to L2) of the spinal cord, and they synapse in two cord-like
chains of ganglia that run close to and in parallel on each side of the spinal cord. The preganglionic neurons are
short in comparison to the postganglionic ones. Axons of the postganglionic neuron extend from the ganglia to
tissues they innervate and regulate (see Chapter 6). In most cases, the preganglionic nerve endings of the
sympathetic nervous system are highly branched, enabling one preganglionic neuron to interact with many
postganglionic neurons. This arrangement enables activation of numerous effector organs at the same time. [Note:
The adrenal medulla, like the sympathetic ganglia, receives preganglionic fibers from the sympathetic system. The
adrenal medulla, in response to stimulation by the ganglionic neurotransmitter acetylcholine, secretes epinephrine
(adrenaline), and lesser amounts of norepinephrine, directly into the blood.]
Figure 3.3 Autonomic nervous system.
4.  Parasympathetic neurons
The parasympathetic preganglionic fibers arise from cranial nerves III (oculomotor), VII (facial), IX
(glossopharyngeal), and X (vagus), as well as from the sacral region (S2 to S4) of the spinal cord and synapse in
ganglia near or on the effector organs. [Note: The vagus nerve accounts for 90% of preganglionic parasympathetic
fibers. Postganglionic neurons from this nerve innervate most organs in the thoracic and abdominal cavity.] Thus, in
contrast to the sympathetic system, the preganglionic fibers are long, and the postganglionic ones are short, with the
ganglia close to or within the organ innervated. In most instances, there is a one-to-one connection between the
preganglionic and postganglionic neurons, enabling discrete response of this system.123

5.  Enteric neurons
The enteric nervous system is the third division of the ANS. It is a collection of nerve fibers that innervate the
gastrointestinal (GI) tract, pancreas, and gallbladder, and it constitutes the “brain of the gut.” This system functions
independently of the CNS and controls motility, exocrine and endocrine secretions, and microcirculation of the GI
tract. It is modulated by both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.

C.  Functions of the sympathetic nervous system
Although continually active to some degree (for example, in maintaining tone of vascular beds), the sympathetic
division is responsible for adjusting in response to stressful situations, such as trauma, fear, hypoglycemia, cold, and
exercise (Figure 3.4).
Figure 3.4 Actions of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems on effector
organs.
1.  Effects of stimulation of the sympathetic division
The effect of sympathetic stimulation is an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, mobilization of energy stores,
and increase in blood flow to skeletal muscles and the heart while diverting flow from the skin and internal organs.
Sympathetic stimulation results in dilation of the pupils and bronchioles ( Figure 3.4). It also reduces GI motility and
affects function of the bladder and sexual organs.
2.  Fight or flight response
The changes experienced by the body during emergencies are referred to as the “fight or flight” response ( Figure
3.5). These reactions are triggered both by direct sympathetic activation of effector organs and by stimulation of the
adrenal medulla to release epinephrine and lesser amounts of norepinephrine. Hormones released by the adrenal
medulla directly enter the bloodstream and promote responses in effector organs that contain adrenergic receptors
(see Chapter 6). The sympathetic nervous system tends to function as a unit and often discharges as a complete
system, for example, during severe exercise or in reactions to fear (Figure 3.5). This system, with its diffuse
distribution of postganglionic fibers, is involved in a wide array of physiologic activities. Although it is not essential
for survival, it is essential in preparing the body to handle uncertain situations and unexpected stimuli.

D.  Functions of the parasympathetic nervous system
The parasympathetic division is involved with maintaining homeostasis within the body. It is required for life, since
it maintains essential bodily functions, such as digestion and elimination. The parasympathetic division usually acts
to oppose or balance the actions of the sympathetic division and generally predominates the sympathetic system in
“rest-and-digest” situations. Unlike the sympathetic system, the parasympathetic system never discharges as a
complete system. If it did, it would produce massive, undesirable, and unpleasant symptoms, such as involuntary
urination and defecation. Instead, parasympathetic fibers innervating specific organs such as the gut, heart, or eye
are activated separately, and the system affects these organs individually.

E.  Role of the CNS in the control of autonomic functions
Although the ANS is a motor system, it does require sensory input from peripheral structures to provide information
on the current state of the body. This feedback is provided by streams of afferent impulses, originating in the viscera
and other autonomically innervated structures that travel to integrating centers in the CNS, such as the
hypothalamus, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord. These centers respond to stimuli by sending out efferent reflex
impulses via the ANS.
1.  Reflex arcs
Most of the afferent impulses are involuntarily translated into reflex responses. For example, a fall in blood pressure
causes pressure-sensitive neurons (baroreceptors in the heart, vena cava, aortic arch, and carotid sinuses) to send
fewer impulses to cardiovascular centers in the brain. This prompts a reflex response of increased sympathetic
output to the heart and vasculature and decreased parasympathetic output to the heart, which results in a
compensatory rise in blood pressure and heart rate (Figure 3.6). [Note: In each case, the reflex arcs of the ANS
comprise a sensory (afferent) arm and a motor (efferent or effector) arm.]

2.  Emotions and the ANS
Stimuli that evoke strong feelings, such as rage, fear, and pleasure, can modify activities of the ANS.

--- PAGE 132 ---

F.  Innervation by the ANS
1.  Dual innervation
Most organs are innervated by both divisions of the ANS. Thus, vagal parasympathetic innervation slows the heart
rate, and sympathetic innervation increases heart rate. Despite this dual innervation, one system usually
predominates in controlling the activity of a given organ. For example, the vagus nerve is the predominant factor for
controlling heart rate. The dual innervation of organs is dynamic, and fine-tuned continually to maintain
homeostasis.
2.  Sympathetic innervation
Although most tissues receive dual innervation, some effector organs, such as the adrenal medulla, kidney,
pilomotor muscles, and sweat glands, receive innervation only from the sympathetic system.
132
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 133 ---

G.  Somatic nervous system
The efferent somatic nervous system differs from the ANS in that a single myelinated motor neuron, originating in
the CNS, travels directly to skeletal muscle without the mediation of ganglia. As noted earlier, the somatic nervous
system is under voluntary control, whereas the ANS is involuntary. Responses in the somatic division are generally
faster than those in the ANS.
133

--- PAGE 134 ---

H.  Summary of differences between sympathetic,
parasympathetic, and motor nerves
Major differences in the anatomical arrangement of neurons lead to variations of the functions in each division
(Figure 3.7). The sympathetic nervous system is widely distributed, innervating practically all effector systems in
the body. By contrast, the distribution of the parasympathetic division is more limited. The sympathetic
preganglionic fibers have a much broader influence than the parasympathetic fibers and synapse with a larger
number of postganglionic fibers. This type of organization permits a diffuse discharge of the sympathetic nervous
system. The parasympathetic division is more circumscribed, with mostly one-to-one interactions, and the ganglia
are also close to, or within, organs they innervate. This limits the amount of branching that can be done by this
division. [A notable exception is found in the myenteric plexus (major nerve supply to the GI tract), where one
preganglionic neuron has been shown to interact with 8000 or more postganglionic fibers.] The anatomical
arrangement of the parasympathetic system results in the distinct functions of this division. The somatic nervous
system innervates skeletal muscles. One somatic motor neuron axon is highly branched, and each branch innervates
a single muscle fiber. Thus, one somatic motor neuron may innervate 100 muscle fibers. This arrangement leads to
the formation of a motor unit. The lack of ganglia and the myelination of the motor nerves enable a fast response by
the somatic nervous system.

III.  Chemical Signaling Between Cells
Neurotransmission in the ANS is an example of chemical signaling between cells. In addition to neurotransmission,
other types of chemical signaling include the secretion of hormones and the release of local mediators (Figure 3.8).
Figure 3.8 Some commonly used mechanisms for transmission of regulatory signals
between cells.
135
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 136 ---

A.  Hormones
Specialized endocrine cells secrete hormones into the bloodstream, where they travel throughout the body, exerting
effects on broadly distributed target cells (see Chapters 23 through 26).
136
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 137 ---

B.  Local mediators
Most cells secrete chemicals that act locally on cells in the immediate environment. Because these chemical signals
are rapidly destroyed or removed, they do not enter the blood and are not distributed throughout the body. Histamine
(see Chapter 37) and prostaglandins are examples of local mediators.
137
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 138 ---

C.  Neurotransmitters
Communication between nerve cells, and between nerve cells and effector organs, occurs through the release of
specific chemical signals (neurotransmitters) from the nerve terminals. The release is triggered by arrival of the
action potential at the nerve ending, leading to depolarization. An increase in intracellular Ca2+ initiates fusion of
synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane and release of their contents. The neurotransmitters rapidly diffuse
across the synaptic cleft, or space (synapse), between neurons and combine with specific receptors on the
postsynaptic (target) cell.
1.  Membrane receptors
All neurotransmitters, and most hormones and local mediators, are too hydrophilic to penetrate the lipid bilayers of
target cell plasma membranes. Instead, their signal is mediated by binding to specific receptors on the cell surface of
target organs. [Note: A receptor is defined as a recognition site for a substance. It has a binding specificity and is
coupled to processes that eventually evoke a response. Most receptors are proteins (see Chapter 2).]
2.  Types of neurotransmitters
Although over 50 signal molecules in the nervous system have been identified, norepinephrine (and the closely
related epinephrine), acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin, histamine, glutamate, and γ-aminobutyric acid are most
commonly involved in the actions of therapeutically useful drugs. Each of these chemical signals binds to a specific
family of receptors. Acetylcholine and norepinephrine are the primary chemical signals in the ANS, whereas a wide
variety of neurotransmitters function in the CNS.
3.  Acetylcholine
The autonomic nerve fibers can be divided into two groups based on the type of neurotransmitter released. If
transmission is mediated by acetylcholine, the neuron is termed cholinergic ( Figure 3.9 and Chapters 4 and 5).
Acetylcholine mediates the transmission of nerve impulses across autonomic ganglia in both the sympathetic and
parasympathetic nervous systems. It is the neurotransmitter at the adrenal medulla. Transmission from the
autonomic postganglionic nerves to the effector organs in the parasympathetic system, and a few sympathetic
system organs, also involves the release of acetylcholine. In the somatic nervous system, transmission at the
neuromuscular junction (the junction of nerve fibers and voluntary muscles) is also cholinergic (Figure 3.9).
Figure 3.9 Summary of the neurotransmitters released, types of receptors, and types of
neurons within the autonomic and somatic nervous systems. Cholinergic neurons are
shown in red and adrenergic neurons in blue. [Note: This schematic diagram does not
show that the parasympathetic ganglia are close to or on the surface of the effector organs
and that the postganglionic fibers are usually shorter than the preganglionic fibers. By
contrast, the ganglia of the sympathetic nervous system are close to the spinal cord. The138
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 139 ---

postganglionic fibers are long, allowing extensive branching to innervate more than one
organ system. This allows the sympathetic nervous system to discharge as a unit.]
*Epinephrine 80% and norepinephrine 20% released from adrenal medulla.
4.  Norepinephrine and epinephrine
When norepinephrine is the neurotransmitter, the fiber is termed adrenergic (Figure 3.9 and Chapters 6 and 7). In the
sympathetic system, norepinephrine mediates the transmission of nerve impulses from autonomic postganglionic
nerves to effector organs. Epinephrine secreted by the adrenal medulla (not sympathetic neurons) also acts as a
chemical messenger in the effector organs. [Note: A few sympathetic fibers, such as those involved in sweating, are
cholinergic, and, for simplicity, they are not shown in Figure 3.9.]

IV.  Signal Transduction in the Effector Cell
The binding of chemical signals to receptors activates enzymatic processes within the cell membrane that ultimately
results in a cellular response, such as the phosphorylation of intracellular proteins or changes in the conductivity of
ion channels (see Chapter 2). A neurotransmitter can be thought of as a signal and a receptor as a signal detector and
transducer. The receptors in the ANS effector cells are classified as adrenergic or cholinergic based on the
neurotransmitters or hormones that bind to them. Epinephrine and norepinephrine bind to adrenergic receptors, and
acetylcholine binds to cholinergic receptors. Cholinergic receptors are further classified as nicotinic or muscarinic.
Some receptors, such as the postsynaptic cholinergic nicotinic receptors in skeletal muscle cells, are directly linked
to membrane ion channels and are known as ionotropic receptors. Binding of neurotransmitter to ionotropic
receptors directly affects ion permeability (Figure 3.10A). All adrenergic receptors and cholinergic muscarinic
receptors are G protein–coupled receptors (metabotropic receptors). Metabotropic receptors mediate the effects of
ligands by activating a second messenger system inside the cell. The two most widely recognized second
messengers are the adenylyl cyclase system and the calcium/phosphatidylinositol system (Figure 3.10B, C ).

3.6Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
Which is correct regarding the sympathetic nervous system?
A.  It generally mediates body functions in “rest-and-digest” mode.
B.  The neurotransmitter at the sympathetic ganglion is norepinephrine (NE).
C.  The neurotransmitter at the sympathetic ganglion is acetylcholine (ACh).
D.  Sympathetic neurons release ACh in the effector organs.
Correct answer = C. The neurotransmitter at the sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia is acetylcholine. The
sympathetic system generally mediates body functions in “fight or flight” mode, and the parasympathetic system
generally mediates body functions in “rest-and-digest” mode. Sympathetic neurons release NE, and
parasympathetic neurons release ACh in the effector cells.
Why does the somatic nervous system enable a faster response compared to the ANS?
A.  Somatic motor neurons have ganglia where neurotransmission is mediated by ACh.
B.  Somatic motor neurons have ganglia where neurotransmission is mediated by NE.
C.  Somatic motor neurons are not myelinated.
D.  Somatic motor neurons are myelinated and do not have ganglia.
Correct answer = D. Somatic motor neurons are myelinated and have no ganglia. This enables faster transmission
in the somatic neurons.
Which physiological change occurs when the parasympathetic system is activated?
A.  Increase in heart rate
B.  Inhibition of lacrimation (tears)
C.  Dilation of the pupil (mydriasis)
D.  Increase in gastric motility
Correct answer = D. Activation of the parasympathetic system causes an increase in gastric motility, increase in
fluid secretions, reduction in heart rate, and constriction of the pupil. In the “rest-and-digest” mode, the
parasympathetic system is more active, which helps with digestion.
Which physiological change is expected when the sympathetic system is inhibited using a pharmacological
agent?
A.  Reduction in heart rate
B.  Increase in blood pressure
C.  Decrease in fluid secretions
D.  Constriction of blood vessels
Correct answer = A. Activation of the sympathetic system causes an increase in heart rate, increase in blood
pressure, reduction or thickening of fluid secretions, and constriction of blood vessels. Therefore, inhibition of the
sympathetic system should theoretically cause a reduction in heart rate, decrease in blood pressure, increase in
fluid secretions, and relaxation of blood vessels.
Which is correct regarding activation of receptors on the effector organs in the ANS?
A.  Acetylcholine activates muscarinic receptors.
B.  Acetylcholine activates adrenergic receptors.
C.  Epinephrine activates nicotinic receptors.
D.  Norepinephrine activates muscarinic receptors.
Correct answer = A. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter in the cholinergic system, and it activates both
muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic receptors, not adrenergic receptors. Norepinephrine and epinephrine activate
adrenergic receptors, not muscarinic receptors.
Which statement concerning the parasympathetic nervous system is correct?
A.  The parasympathetic system often discharges as a single, functional system.
B.  The parasympathetic division is involved in near vision, movement of food, and urination.
C.  The postganglionic fibers of the parasympathetic division are long, compared to those of the sympathetic
nervous system.
D.  The parasympathetic system controls the secretion of the adrenal medulla.
Correct answer = B. The parasympathetic nervous system maintains essential bodily functions, such as vision,
movement of food, and urination. It uses acetylcholine, not norepinephrine, as a neurotransmitter, and it
discharges as discrete fibers that are activated separately. The postganglionic fibers of the parasympathetic system
are short compared to those of the sympathetic division. The adrenal medulla is under the control of the
sympathetic system.143

3.10Which is correct regarding neurotransmitters and neurotransmission?
A.  Neurotransmitters are released from the presynaptic nerve terminals.
B.  Arrival of an action potential in the postsynaptic cell triggers release of neurotransmitter.
C.  Intracellular calcium levels drop in the neuron before the release of neurotransmitter.
D.  Serotonin and dopamine are the primary neurotransmitters in the ANS.
Correct answer = A. Neurotransmitters are released from presynaptic neurons, triggered by the arrival of an action
potential in the presynaptic neuron (not in the postsynaptic cell). When an action potential arrives in the
presynaptic neuron, calcium enters the presynaptic neuron and calcium levels increase in the neuron before
neurotransmitter is released. The main neurotransmitters in the ANS are norepinephrine and acetylcholine.
An elderly man is brought to the emergency room after ingesting a large quantity of prazosin tablets, a drug
that blocks α1 adrenergic receptors, which mediate effects of epinephrine and norepinephrine on the blood
vessels and urinary bladder. Which symptom is most likely to be seen in this patient?
A.  Reduced heart rate (bradycardia)
B.  Dilation of blood vessels (vasorelaxation)
C.  Increased blood pressure
D.  Reduction in urinary frequency
Correct answer = B. Activation of α1 receptors causes vasoconstriction, reduction in urinary frequency, and an
increase in blood pressure, without a direct effect on the heart rate. It may cause reflex tachycardia (increase in
heart rate) in some patients. Thus blockade of α1 receptors could theoretically cause dilation of blood vessels,
reduction in blood pressure, and increase in urinary frequency. It should not cause a reduction in heart rate.
Which statement is correct regarding the autonomic nervous system?
A.  Afferent neurons carry impulses from the central nervous system (CNS) to the effector organs.
B.  Preganglionic neurons of the sympathetic system arise from the cranial nerves, as well as from the sacral region.
C.  When there is a sudden drop in blood pressure, the baroreceptors send signals to the brain to activate the
parasympathetic system.
D.  The heart receives both sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation.
Correct answer = D. The heart receives both sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation. Activation of
sympathetic neurons increases the heart rate and force of contraction, and activation of parasympathetic neurons
reduces the heart rate and force of contraction (slightly). Afferent neurons carry impulses from the periphery to
the CNS, and efferent neurons carry signals away from the CNS. Preganglionic neurons of the sympathetic
system arise from thoracic and lumbar regions of the spinal cord, whereas the preganglionic neurons of the
parasympathetic system arise from cranial nerves and the sacral region. When there is a sudden drop in blood
pressure, the sympathetic system is activated, not the parasympathetic system.
Which is correct regarding membrane receptors and signal transduction?
A.  ANS neurotransmitters bind to membrane receptors on the effector cells, which leads to intracellular events.
B.  Cholinergic muscarinic receptors are ionotropic receptors.
C.  Cholinergic nicotinic receptors are metabotropic receptors.
D.  Metabotropic receptors activate ion channels directly.
Correct answer = A. Neurotransmitters generally bind to membrane receptors on the postsynaptic effector cells
and cause cellular effects. Acetylcholine (ACh) binds to cholinergic muscarinic receptors and activates the second
messenger pathway in effector cells, which in turn causes cellular events. Receptors that are coupled to second
messenger systems are known as metabotropic receptors. Metabotropic receptors do not directly activate ion
channels. ACh also binds to cholinergic nicotinic receptors and activates ion channels on the effector cells. The
receptors that directly activate ion channels are known as ionotropic receptors.144

I.  Overview
Drugs affecting the autonomic nervous system (ANS) are divided into two groups according to the type of neuron
involved in the mechanism of action. The cholinergic drugs, which are described in this and the following chapter,
act on receptors activated by acetylcholine (ACh), whereas the adrenergic drugs ( Chapters 6 and 7) act on receptors
stimulated by norepinephrine or epinephrine. Cholinergic and adrenergic drugs act by either stimulating or blocking
receptors of the ANS. Figure 4.1 summarizes cholinergic agonists discussed in this chapter.
Figure 4.1 Summary of cholinergic agonists.
146
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 147 ---

II.  The Cholinergic Neuron
The preganglionic fibers terminating in the adrenal medulla, the autonomic ganglia (both parasympathetic and
sympathetic), and the postganglionic fibers of the parasympathetic division use ACh as a neurotransmitter (Figure
4.2). The postganglionic sympathetic division of sweat glands also uses ACh. In addition, cholinergic neurons
innervate the muscles of the somatic system and play an important role in the central nervous system (CNS).
Figure 4.2 Sites of actions of cholinergic agonists in the autonomic and somatic nervous
systems.
147
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 148 ---

A.  Neurotransmission at cholinergic neurons
Neurotransmission in cholinergic neurons involves six sequential steps: 1) synthesis of ACh, 2) storage, 3) release,
4) binding of ACh to the receptor, 5) degradation of ACh in the synaptic cleft (the space between the nerve endings
and adjacent receptors on nerves or effector organs), and 6) recycling of choline (Figure 4.3).
Figure 4.3 Synthesis and release of acetylcholine from the cholinergic neuron. AcCoA =
acetyl coenzyme A.
1.  Synthesis of acetylcholine
Choline is transported from the extracellular fluid into the cytoplasm of the cholinergic neuron by an energy-
dependent carrier system that cotransports sodium and can be inhibited by the drug hemicholinium. [Note: Choline
has a quaternary nitrogen and carries a permanent positive charge and, thus, cannot diffuse through the membrane.]
The uptake of choline is the rate-limiting step in ACh synthesis. Choline acetyltransferase catalyzes the reaction of
choline with acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) to form ACh (an ester) in the cytosol.
2.  Storage of acetylcholine in vesicles
ACh is packaged and stored into presynaptic vesicles by an active transport process. The mature vesicle contains not
only ACh but also adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and proteoglycan. Cotransmission from autonomic neurons is the
rule rather than the exception. This means that most synaptic vesicles contain the primary neurotransmitter (here,
ACh) as well as a cotransmitter (here, ATP) that increases or decreases the effect of the primary neurotransmitter.
3.  Release of acetylcholine
When an action potential propagated by voltage-sensitive sodium channels arrives at a nerve ending, voltage-
sensitive calcium channels on the presynaptic membrane open, causing an increase in the concentration of
intracellular calcium. Elevated calcium levels promote the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the cell membrane and
the release of contents into the synaptic space. This release can be blocked by botulinum toxin. In contrast, the toxin
in black widow spider venom causes all the ACh stored in synaptic vesicles to empty into the synaptic gap.
4.  Binding to the receptor
ACh released from the synaptic vesicles diffuses across the synaptic space and binds to postsynaptic receptors on the
target cell, to presynaptic receptors on the membrane of the neuron that released ACh, or to other targeted
presynaptic receptors. The postsynaptic cholinergic receptors on the surface of effector organs are divided into two
classes: muscarinic and nicotinic (Figure 4.2). Binding to a receptor leads to a biologic response within the cell, such
as the initiation of a nerve impulse in a postganglionic fiber or activation of specific enzymes in effector cells, as148
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 149 ---

mediated by second messenger molecules.
5.  Degradation of acetylcholine
The signal at the postjunctional effector site is rapidly terminated, because acetylcholinesterase (AChE) cleaves ACh
to choline and acetate in the synaptic cleft.
6.  Recycling of choline
Choline may be recaptured by a sodium-coupled, high-affinity uptake system that transports the molecule back into
the neuron. There, it is available to be acetylated into ACh.
149
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 150 ---

III.  Cholinergic Receptors (Cholinoceptors)
Two families of cholinoceptors, designated muscarinic and nicotinic receptors, can be distinguished from each other
on the basis of their different affinities for agents that mimic the action of ACh (cholinomimetic agents).
150
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 151 ---

A.  Muscarinic receptors
Muscarinic receptors belong to the class of G-protein–coupled receptors (metabotropic receptors). These receptors,
in addition to binding ACh, also recognize muscarine, an alkaloid in certain poisonous mushrooms. By contrast, the
muscarinic receptors show only a weak affinity for nicotine, an alkaloid found in tobacco and other plants ( Figure
4.4A). There are five subclasses of muscarinic receptors; however, only M1, M2, and M3 receptors have been
functionally characterized.
Figure 4.4 Types of cholinergic receptors.
1.  Location of muscarinic receptors
These receptors are found on the autonomic effector organs, such as the heart, smooth muscle, brain, and exocrine
151
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 152 ---

glands. Although all five subtypes are found on neurons, M1 receptors are also found on gastric parietal cells, M2
receptors on cardiac cells and smooth muscle, and M3 receptors on the bladder, exocrine glands, and smooth muscle.
[Note: Drugs with muscarinic actions preferentially stimulate muscarinic receptors on these tissues, but at high
concentration, they may show some activity at nicotinic receptors.]
2.  Mechanism of acetylcholine signal transduction
A number of different molecular mechanisms transmit the signal generated by ACh occupation of the receptor. For
example, when M1 or M3 receptors are activated, the receptor undergoes a conformational change and interacts with
a G-protein that activates phospholipase C. This ultimately leads to production of second messengers inositol-1,4,5-
trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 causes an increase in intracellular Ca2+. Calcium can then interact
to stimulate or inhibit enzymes or to cause hyperpolarization, secretion, or contraction. DAG activates protein kinase
C, an enzyme that phosphorylates numerous proteins within the cell. In contrast, activation of the M2 subtype on the
cardiac muscle stimulates a G-protein that inhibits adenylyl cyclase and increases K+ conductance. The heart
responds with a decrease in rate and force of contraction.
3.  Muscarinic agonists
Pilocarpine is a nonselective muscarinic agonist used to treat xerostomia and glaucoma. Attempts are currently
underway to develop muscarinic agents that are directed against specific receptor subtypes.
152
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 153 ---

B.  Nicotinic receptors
These receptors, in addition to binding ACh, also recognize nicotine but show only a weak affinity for muscarine
(Figure 4.4B ). The nicotinic receptor is composed of five subunits, and it functions as a ligand-gated ion channel
(ionotropic receptor). Binding of two ACh molecules elicits a conformational change that allows the entry of sodium
ions, resulting in the depolarization of the effector cell. Nicotine at low concentration stimulates the receptor,
whereas nicotine at high concentration blocks the receptor. Nicotinic receptors are located in the CNS, the adrenal
medulla, autonomic ganglia, and the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in skeletal muscles. Those at the NMJ are
sometimes designated NM, and the others, NN. The nicotinic receptors of autonomic ganglia differ from those of the
NMJ. For example, ganglionic receptors are selectively blocked by mecamylamine, whereas NMJ receptors are
specifically blocked by atracurium.

--- PAGE 154 ---

IV.  Direct-Acting Cholinergic Agonists
Cholinergic agonists mimic the effects of ACh by binding directly to cholinoceptors (muscarinic or nicotinic). These
agents may be broadly classified into two groups: 1) choline esters, which include endogenous ACh and synthetic
esters of choline, such as carbachol  and bethanechol , and 2) naturally occurring alkaloids, such as nicotine and
pilocarpine (Figure 4.5). All direct-acting cholinergic drugs have a longer duration of action than ACh. The more
therapeutically useful drugs (pilocarpine and bethanechol ) preferentially bind to muscarinic receptors and are
sometimes referred to as muscarinic agents. However, as a group, the direct-acting agonists show little specificity in
their actions, which limits clinical usefulness.

A.  Acetylcholine
Acetylcholine [ah-see-teel-KOE-leen] is a quaternary ammonium compound that cannot penetrate membranes.
Although it is the neurotransmitter of parasympathetic and somatic nerves as well as autonomic ganglia, it lacks
therapeutic importance because of its multiplicity of actions (leading to diffuse effects) and its rapid inactivation by
the cholinesterases. ACh has both muscarinic and nicotinic activity. Its actions include the following:
1.  Decrease in heart rate and cardiac output
The actions of ACh on the heart mimic the effects of vagal stimulation. For example, if injected intravenously, ACh
produces a brief decrease in cardiac rate (bradycardia) and cardiac output, mainly because of a reduction in the rate
of firing at the sinoatrial (SA) node. [Note: Normal vagal activity regulates the heart by the release of ACh at the SA
node.]
2.  Decrease in blood pressure
Injection of ACh causes vasodilation and lowering of blood pressure by an indirect mechanism of action. ACh
activates M3 receptors found on endothelial cells lining the smooth muscles of blood vessels. This results in the
production of nitric oxide from arginine. Nitric oxide then diffuses to vascular smooth muscle cells to stimulate
protein kinase G production, leading to hyperpolarization and smooth muscle relaxation via phosphodiesterase-3
inhibition. In the absence of administered cholinergic agents, the vascular cholinergic receptors have no known
function, because ACh is never released into the blood in significant quantities. Atropine blocks these muscarinic
receptors and prevents ACh from producing vasodilation.
3.  Other actions
In the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, acetylcholine increases salivary secretion, increases gastric acid secretion, and
stimulates intestinal secretions and motility. It also enhances bronchiolar secretions and causes bronchoconstriction.
[Note: Methacholine, a direct-acting cholinergic agonist, is used to assist in the diagnosis of asthma due to its
bronchoconstricting properties.] In the genitourinary tract, ACh increases the tone of the detrusor muscle, causing
urination. In the eye, ACh is involved in stimulation of ciliary muscle contraction for near vision and in the
constriction of the pupillae sphincter muscle, causing miosis (marked constriction of the pupil). ACh (1% solution)
is instilled into the anterior chamber of the eye to produce miosis during ophthalmic surgery.

--- PAGE 158 ---

B.  Bethanechol
Bethanechol  [be-THAN-e-kole] is an unsubstituted carbamoyl ester, structurally related to ACh ( Figure 4.5). It is
not hydrolyzed by AChE due to the esterification of carbamic acid, although it is inactivated through hydrolysis by
other esterases. It lacks nicotinic actions (due to addition of the methyl group), but does have strong muscarinic
activity. Its major actions are on the smooth musculature of the bladder and GI tract. It has about a 1-hour duration
of action.
1.  Actions
Bethanechol  directly stimulates muscarinic receptors, causing increased intestinal motility and tone. It also
stimulates the detrusor muscle of the bladder, whereas the trigone and sphincter muscles are relaxed. These effects
stimulate urination.
2.  Therapeutic uses
In urologic treatment, bethanechol  is used to stimulate the atonic bladder, particularly in postpartum or
postoperative, nonobstructive urinary retention. Bethanechol  may also be used to treat neurogenic atony as well as
megacolon.
3.  Adverse effects
Bethanechol  can cause generalized cholinergic stimulation (Figure 4.6), with sweating, salivation, flushing,
decreased blood pressure (with reflex tachycardia), nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bronchospasm. Atropine
sulfate may be administered to overcome severe cardiovascular or bronchoconstrictor responses to this agent.

C.  Carbachol (carbamylcholine)
Carbachol  [KAR-ba-kole] has both muscarinic and nicotinic actions. Like bethanechol , carbachol  is an ester of
carbamic acid (Figure 4.5) and a poor substrate for AChE. It is biotransformed by other esterases, but at a much
slower rate.
1.  Actions
Carbachol  has profound effects on both the cardiovascular and GI systems because of its ganglion-stimulating
activity, and it may first stimulate and then depress these systems. It can cause release of epinephrine from the
adrenal medulla by its nicotinic action. Locally instilled into the eye, it mimics the effects of ACh, causing miosis
and a spasm of accommodation in which the ciliary muscle of the eye remains in a constant state of contraction. The
vision becomes fixed at some particular distance, making it impossible to focus (Figure 4.7). [Note the opposing
effects of atropine, a muscarinic blocker, on the eye.]
Figure 4.7 Actions of pilocarpine, carbachol, and atropine on the iris and ciliary muscle
of the eye.
161
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 162 ---

2.  Therapeutic uses
Because of its high potency, receptor nonselectivity, and relatively long duration of action, carbachol  is rarely used.
Intraocular use provides miosis for eye surgery and lowers intraocular pressure in the treatment of glaucoma.
3.  Adverse effects
With ophthalmologic use, few adverse effects occur due to lack of systemic penetration (quaternary amine).
162
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 163 ---

D.  Pilocarpine
The alkaloid pilocarpine [pye-loe-KAR-peen] is a tertiary amine and is stable to hydrolysis by AChE (Figure 4.5).
Compared with ACh and its derivatives, it is far less potent but is uncharged and can penetrate the CNS at
therapeutic doses. Pilocarpine exhibits muscarinic activity and is used primarily in ophthalmology.
1.  Actions
Applied topically to the eye, pilocarpine produces rapid miosis, contraction of the ciliary muscle, and spasm of
accommodation. Pilocarpine is one of the most potent stimulators of secretions such as sweat, tears, and saliva, but
its use for producing these effects has been limited due to its lack of selectivity.
2.  Therapeutic uses
Pilocarpine is used to treat glaucoma and is the drug of choice for emergency lowering of intraocular pressure of
both open-angle and angle-closure glaucoma. Pilocarpine is extremely effective in opening the trabecular meshwork
around the Schlemm canal, causing an immediate drop in intraocular pressure because of the increased drainage of
aqueous humor. This action occurs within a few minutes, lasts 4 to 8 hours, and can be repeated. [Note: Topical
carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, such as dorzolamide and β-adrenergic blockers such as timolol , are effective in
treating glaucoma but are not used for emergency lowering of intraocular pressure.] The miotic action of pilocarpine
is also useful in reversing mydriasis due to atropine.
The drug is beneficial in promoting salivation in patients with xerostomia resulting from irradiation of the head
and neck. Sjögren syndrome, which is characterized by dry mouth and lack of tears, is treated with oral pilocarpine
tablets and cevimeline, a cholinergic drug that also has the drawback of being nonspecific.
3.  Adverse effects
Pilocarpine can cause blurred vision, night blindness, and brow ache. Poisoning with this agent is characterized by
exaggeration of various parasympathetic effects, including profuse sweating (diaphoresis) and salivation. The effects
are similar to those produced by consumption of mushrooms of the genus Inocybe, which contain muscarine.
Parenteral atropine, at doses that can cross the blood–brain barrier, is administered to counteract the toxicity of
pilocarpine.

V.  Indirect-Acting Cholinergic Agonists: Anticholinesterase
Agents (Reversible)
AChE is an enzyme that specifically cleaves ACh to acetate and choline and, thus, terminates its actions. It is located
both pre- and postsynaptically in the nerve terminal where it is membrane bound. Inhibitors of AChE
(anticholinesterase agents or cholinesterase inhibitors) indirectly provide cholinergic action by preventing the
degradation of ACh. This results in an accumulation of ACh in the synaptic space (Figure 4.8). Therefore, these
drugs can provoke a response at all cholinoceptors, including both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors of the ANS, as
well as at the NMJ and in the brain. The reversible AChE inhibitors can be broadly classified as short-acting or
intermediate-acting agents.
Figure 4.8 Mechanisms of action of indirect cholinergic agonists. AChE =
acetylcholinesterase.
164
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 165 ---

A.  Edrophonium
Edrophonium [ed-row-FOE-nee-um] is the prototype short-acting AChE inhibitor. Edrophonium binds reversibly to
the active center of AChE, preventing hydrolysis of ACh. It has a short duration of action of 10 to 20 minutes due to
rapid renal elimination. Edrophonium is a quaternary amine, and its actions are limited to the periphery. It is used in
the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disease caused by antibodies to the nicotinic receptor at the
NMJ. This causes the degradation of the nicotinic receptors, making fewer receptors available for interaction with
ACh. Intravenous injection of edrophonium leads to a rapid increase in muscle strength in patients with myasthenia
gravis. Care must be taken, because excess drug may provoke a cholinergic crisis ( atropine is the antidote).
Edrophonium may also be used to assess cholinesterase inhibitor therapy, for differentiating cholinergic and
myasthenic crises, and for reversing the effects of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers (NMBs) after surgery.
Due to the availability of other agents, edrophonium use has become limited.

--- PAGE 166 ---

B.  Physostigmine
Physostigmine [fi-zoe-STIG-meen] is a nitrogenous carbamic acid ester found naturally in plants and is a tertiary
amine. It is a substrate for AChE, and it forms a relatively stable carbamoylated intermediate with the enzyme,
which then becomes reversibly inactivated. The result is potentiation of cholinergic activity throughout the body.
1.  Actions
Physostigmine has a wide range of effects and stimulates not only the muscarinic and nicotinic sites of the ANS, but
also the nicotinic receptors of the NMJ. Muscarinic stimulation can cause contraction of GI smooth muscles, miosis,
bradycardia, and hypotension (Figure 4.9). Nicotinic stimulation can cause skeletal muscle twitches, fasciculations,
and skeletal muscle paralysis (at higher doses). Its duration of action is about 30 minutes to 2 hours, and it is
considered an intermediate-acting agent. Physostigmine can enter and stimulate the cholinergic sites in the CNS.
Figure 4.9 Some actions of physostigmine.
166
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 167 ---

2.  Therapeutic uses
Physostigmine is used in the treatment of overdoses of drugs with anticholinergic actions, such as atropine, and to
reverse the effects of NMBs.
3.  Adverse effects
High doses of physostigmine may lead to convulsions. Bradycardia and a fall in cardiac output may also occur.
Inhibition of AChE at the NMJ causes the accumulation of ACh and, ultimately through continuous depolarization,
results in paralysis of skeletal muscle. However, these effects are rarely seen with therapeutic doses.
167
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 168 ---

C.  Neostigmine
Neostigmine [nee-oh-STIG-meen] is a synthetic compound that is also a carbamic acid ester, and it reversibly
inhibits AChE in a manner similar to physostigmine.
1.  Actions
Unlike physostigmine, neostigmine has a quaternary nitrogen. Therefore, it is more polar, is absorbed poorly from
the GI tract, and does not enter the CNS. Its effect on skeletal muscle is greater than physostigmine, and it can
stimulate contractility before it paralyzes. Neostigmine has an intermediate duration of action, usually 30 minutes to
2 hours.
2.  Therapeutic uses
It is used to stimulate the bladder and GI tract and as an antidote for competitive neuromuscular-blocking agents.
Neostigmine is also used to manage symptoms of myasthenia gravis.
3.  Adverse effects
Adverse effects of neostigmine include those of generalized cholinergic stimulation, such as salivation, flushing,
decreased blood pressure, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bronchospasm. Neostigmine does not cause CNS
side effects and is not used to overcome toxicity of central-acting antimuscarinic agents such as atropine.
Neostigmine is contraindicated when intestinal or urinary bladder obstruction is present.
168

--- PAGE 169 ---

D.  Pyridostigmine
Pyridostigmine [peer-id-oh-STIG-meen] is another cholinesterase inhibitor used in the chronic management of
myasthenia gravis. Its duration of action is intermediate (3 to 6 hours) but longer than that of neostigmine. Adverse
effects are similar to those of neostigmine.

--- PAGE 170 ---

E.  Tacrine, donepezil , rivastigmine, and galantamine
Patients with Alzheimer disease have a deficiency of cholinergic neurons and therefore lower levels of ACh in the
CNS. This observation led to the development of anticholinesterases as possible remedies for the loss of cognitive
function. Tacrine [TAK-reen], the first agent in this category, has been replaced by others because of its
hepatotoxicity. Despite the ability of donepezil  [doe-NEP-e-zil], rivastigmine [ri-va-STIG-meen], and galantamine
[ga-LAN-ta-meen] to delay the progression of Alzheimer disease, none can stop its progression. GI distress is their
primary adverse effect (see Chapter 8).

VI.  Indirect-Acting Cholinergic Agonists: Anticholinesterase
Agents (Irreversible)
A number of synthetic organophosphate compounds have the ability to bind covalently to AChE. The result is a
long-lasting increase in ACh at all sites where it is released. Many of these drugs are extremely toxic and were
developed by the military as nerve agents. Related compounds, such as parathion and malathion, are used as
insecticides.
171
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 172 ---

A.  Echothiophate
1.  Mechanism of action
Echothiophate [ek-oe-THI-oh-fate] is an organophosphate that covalently binds via its phosphate group at the active
site of AChE (Figure 4.10). Once this occurs, the enzyme is permanently inactivated, and restoration of AChE
activity requires the synthesis of new enzyme molecules. Following covalent modification of AChE, the
phosphorylated enzyme slowly releases one of its ethyl groups. The loss of an alkyl group, which is called aging,
makes it impossible for chemical reactivators, such as pralidoxime, to break the bond between the remaining drug
and the enzyme.

Figure 4.10 Covalent modification of acetylcholinesterase by echothiophate. Also shown
is the reactivation of the enzyme with pralidoxime (2-PAM). R = (CH3)3N+–CH2–CH2–;
RSH = (CH3)3N+–CH2–CH2–S-H.
2.  Actions
Actions include generalized cholinergic stimulation, paralysis of motor function (causing breathing difficulties), and
convulsions. Echothiophate produces intense miosis and, thus, has found therapeutic use. Intraocular pressure falls
from the facilitation of outflow of aqueous humor. Atropine in high dosages can reverse many of the peripheral and
some of the central muscarinic effects of echothiophate.
3.  Therapeutic uses
A topical ophthalmic solution of the drug is available for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma. However,
echothiophate is rarely used due to its side effect profile, which includes the risk of cataracts. Figure 4.11
summarizes actions of some cholinergic agonists.

VII.  Toxicology of Anticholinesterase Agents
Irreversible AChE inhibitors (mostly organophosphate compounds) are commonly used as agricultural insecticides
in the United States, which has led to numerous cases of accidental poisoning with these agents. In addition, they are
frequently used for suicidal and homicidal purposes. Organophosphate nerve gases such as sarin are used as agents
of warfare and chemical terrorism. Toxicity with these agents is manifested as nicotinic and muscarinic signs and
symptoms (cholinergic crisis). Depending on the agent, the effects can be peripheral or can affect the whole body.
175

--- PAGE 176 ---

A.  Reactivation of acetylcholinesterase
Pralidoxime [pral-i-DOX-eem] (2-PAM) can reactivate inhibited AChE (Figure 4.10). However, it is unable to
penetrate into the CNS and therefore is not useful in treating the CNS effects of organophosphates. The presence of
a charged group allows it to approach an anionic site on the enzyme, where it essentially displaces the phosphate
group of the organophosphate and regenerates the enzyme. If given before aging of the alkylated enzyme occurs, it
can reverse both muscarinic and nicotinic peripheral effects of organophosphates, but not the CNS effects. With the
newer nerve agents that produce aging of the enzyme complex within seconds, pralidoxime is less effective. In
addition, it cannot overcome toxicity of reversible AChE inhibitors (for example, physostigmine).

B.  Other treatments
Atropine is administered to prevent muscarinic side effects of these agents. Such effects include increased bronchial
and salivary secretion, bronchoconstriction, and bradycardia. Diazepam is also administered to reduce the persistent
convulsion caused by these agents. General supportive measures, such as maintenance of patent airway, oxygen
supply, and artificial respiration, may be necessary as well.

4.5Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
Botulinum toxin blocks the release of acetylcholine from cholinergic nerve terminals. Which is a possible
effect of botulinum toxin?
A.  Skeletal muscle paralysis
B.  Improvement of myasthenia gravis symptoms
C.  Increased salivation
D.  Reduced heart rate
Correct answer = A. Acetylcholine released by cholinergic neurons acts on nicotinic receptors in the skeletal
muscle cells to cause contraction. Therefore, blockade of ACh release causes skeletal muscle paralysis.
Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease where antibodies are produced against nicotinic receptors and
inactivate nicotinic receptors. A reduction in ACh release therefore worsens (not improves) the symptoms of this
condition. Reduction in ACh release by botulinum toxin causes reduction in secretions including saliva (not
increase in salivation), causing dry mouth and an increase (not reduction) in heart rate due to reduced vagal
activity.
A patient develops urinary retention after an abdominal surgery. Urinary obstruction was ruled out in this
patient. Which strategy would be helpful in promoting urination?
A.  Activating nicotinic receptors
B.  Inhibiting the release of acetylcholine
C.  Inhibiting cholinesterase enzyme
D.  Blocking muscarinic receptors
Correct answer = C. Activation of muscarinic receptors in the detrusor muscle of the urinary bladder can promote
urination in patients where the tone of detrusor muscle is low. Inhibiting cholinesterase enzyme increases the
levels of acetylcholine, and acetylcholine can increase the tone of the detrusor muscle. There are no nicotinic
receptors in the detrusor muscle; therefore, activation of nicotinic receptors is not helpful. Inhibiting the release of
acetylcholine or blocking muscarinic receptors worsens urinary retention.
Which of the following drugs could theoretically improve asthma symptoms?
A.  Bethanechol
B.  Pilocarpine
C.  Pyridostigmine
D.  Atropine
Correct answer = D. Muscarinic agonists and drugs that increase acetylcholine levels cause constriction of
bronchial smooth muscles and could exacerbate asthma symptoms. Bethanechol and pilocarpine are muscarinic
agonists, and pyridostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor that increases levels of acetylcholine. Atropine is a
muscarinic antagonist and therefore does not exacerbate asthma. Theoretically, it should relieve symptoms of
asthma (not used clinically for this purpose).
If an ophthalmologist wants to dilate the pupils for an eye examination, which drug/class of drugs is
theoretically useful?
A.  Muscarinic receptor activator (agonist)
B.  Muscarinic receptor inhibitor (antagonist)
C.  Pilocarpine
D.  Neostigmine
Correct answer = B. Muscarinic agonists (for example, pilocarpine) contract the circular smooth muscles in the
iris sphincter and constrict the pupil (miosis). Anticholinesterases (for example, neostigmine, physostigmine) also
cause miosis by increasing the level of ACh. Muscarinic antagonists, on the other hand, relax the circular smooth
muscles in the iris sphincter and cause dilation of the pupil (mydriasis).
In Alzheimer disease, there is a deficiency of cholinergic neuronal function in the brain. Theoretically, which
strategy is useful in treating symptoms of Alzheimer disease?
A.  Inhibiting cholinergic receptors in the brain
B.  Inhibiting the release of acetylcholine in the brain
C.  Inhibiting the acetylcholinesterase enzyme in the brain
D.  Activating the acetylcholinesterase enzyme in the brain
Correct answer = C. Because there is already a deficiency in brain cholinergic function in Alzheimer disease,
inhibiting cholinergic receptors or inhibiting the release of ACh worsens the condition. Activating the
acetylcholinesterase enzyme increases the degradation of ACh, which also worsens the condition. However,
inhibiting the acetylcholinesterase enzyme helps to increase the levels of ACh in the brain and thereby relieve the
symptoms of Alzheimer disease.178

4.10An elderly female who lives in a farmhouse was brought to the emergency room in serious condition after
ingesting a liquid from an unlabeled bottle found near her bed, apparently in a suicide attempt. She presented
with diarrhea, frequent urination, convulsions, breathing difficulties, constricted pupils (miosis), and
excessive salivation. Which of the following is correct regarding this patient?
A.  She most likely consumed an organophosphate pesticide.
B.  The symptoms are consistent with sympathetic activation.
C.  Her symptoms can be treated using an anticholinesterase agent.
D.  Her symptoms can be treated using a cholinergic agonist.
Correct answer = A. The symptoms are consistent with that of cholinergic crisis. Since the elderly female lives on
a farm and the symptoms are consistent with a cholinergic crisis (usually caused by cholinesterase inhibitors), it
may be assumed that she has consumed an organophosphate pesticide (irreversible cholinesterase inhibitor).
Assuming that the symptoms are caused by organophosphate poisoning, administering an anticholinesterase agent
or a cholinergic agonist will worsen the condition. The symptoms are not consistent with that of sympathetic
activation, as sympathetic activation will cause symptoms opposite to that of cholinergic crisis seen in this
patient.
A patient who received a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocker (NMB) for skeletal muscle relaxation
during surgery is experiencing mild skeletal muscle paralysis after the surgery. Which drug could reverse
this effect of NMBs?
A.  Pilocarpine
B.  Bethanechol
C.  Neostigmine
D.  Atropine
Correct answer = C. Neuromuscular blockers act by blocking nicotinic receptors on the skeletal muscles.
Increasing the levels of ACh in the neuromuscular junctions can reverse the effects of NMBs. Therefore,
neostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, could reverse the effects of NMBs. Pilocarpine and bethanechol are
preferentially muscarinic agonists and have no effects on the nicotinic receptors. Atropine is a muscarinic
antagonist and has no effects on nicotinic receptors.
A 60-year-old female who had a cancerous growth in the neck region underwent radiation therapy. Her
salivary secretion was reduced due to radiation and she suffers from dry mouth (xerostomia). Which drug
would be most useful in treating xerostomia in this patient?
A.  Acetylcholine
B.  Pilocarpine
C.  Echothiophate
D.  Atropine
Correct answer = B. Salivary secretion may be enhanced by activating muscarinic receptors in the salivary glands.
This can be achieved in theory by using a muscarinic agonist or an anticholinesterase agent. Pilocarpine is a
muscarinic agonist administered orally for this purpose. Acetylcholine has similar effects as that of pilocarpine;
however, it cannot be used therapeutically as it is rapidly destroyed by cholinesterase in the body. Echothiophate
is an irreversible cholinesterase inhibitor, but it cannot be used therapeutically because of its toxic effects.
Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist and worsens dry mouth.
A 40-year-old male presents to his family physician with drooping eyelids, difficulty chewing and
swallowing, and muscle fatigue even on mild exertion. Which agent could be used to diagnose myasthenia
gravis in this patient?
A.  Atropine
B.  Edrophonium
C.  Pralidoxime
D.  Echothiophate
Correct answer = B. The function of nicotinic receptors in skeletal muscles is diminished in myasthenia gravis
due to the development of antibodies to nicotinic receptors (autoimmune disease). Any drug that increases levels
of ACh in the neuromuscular junction can improve symptoms in myasthenia gravis. Thus, edrophonium, a
reversible cholinesterase inhibitor with a short duration of action can temporarily improve skeletal muscle
weakness in myasthenia gravis, serving as a diagnostic tool. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist and has no role
in skeletal muscle function. Pralidoxime is a drug that is used to reverse the binding of irreversible cholinesterase
inhibitors with cholinesterase enzyme and helps to reactivate cholinesterase enzyme. Hence, pralidoxime will not
be useful in improving skeletal muscle function in myasthenia gravis.
Atropa belladonna is a plant that contains atropine (a muscarinic antagonist). Which of the following drugs
or classes of drugs will be most useful in treating poisoning with belladonna?
A.  Malathion
B.  Physostigmine
C.  Muscarinic antagonists
D.  Nicotinic antagonists179
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 180 ---

Correct answer = B. Atropine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist that causes anticholinergic effects.
Muscarinic agonists or any other drugs that increase the levels of ACh are able to counteract effects of atropine.
Thus, anticholinesterases such as malathion and physostigmine can counteract the effects of atropine, in theory.
However, since malathion is an irreversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, it is not used for systemic treatment
in patients. Muscarinic antagonists worsen the toxicity of atropine. Nicotinic antagonists can worsen the toxicity
by acting on parasympathetic ganglionic receptors and thus reducing the release of ACh.

Cholinergic Antagonists

--- PAGE 182 ---

I.  Overview
Cholinergic antagonist is a general term for agents that bind to cholinoceptors (muscarinic or nicotinic) and prevent
the effects of acetylcholine (ACh) and other cholinergic agonists. The most clinically useful of these agents are
selective blockers of muscarinic receptors. They are commonly known as anticholinergic agents (a misnomer, as
they antagonize only muscarinic receptors), antimuscarinic agents (more accurate terminology), or
parasympatholytics. The effects of parasympathetic innervation are thus, interrupted by these agents, and the actions
of sympathetic innervation are left unopposed. A second group of drugs, the ganglionic blockers, shows a preference
for nicotinic receptors of the sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia. Clinically, they are the least important
cholinergic antagonists. A third family of compounds, the neuromuscular blocking agents (mostly nicotinic
antagonists), interfere with transmission of efferent impulses to skeletal muscles. These drugs are used as skeletal
muscle relaxants in surgical anesthesia and as agents to facilitate intubation in surgical and critical care patients.
Figure 5.1 summarizes the cholinergic antagonists discussed in this chapter.

II.  Antimuscarinic Agents
Commonly known as anticholinergic drugs, these agents (for example, atropine and scopolamine) block muscarinic
receptors (Figure 5.2), causing inhibition of muscarinic functions. In addition, these drugs block the few exceptional
sympathetic neurons that are cholinergic, such as those innervating the salivary and sweat glands. Because they do
not block nicotinic receptors, the anticholinergic drugs (more precisely, antimuscarinic drugs) have little or no action
at skeletal neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) or autonomic ganglia. The anticholinergic drugs are beneficial in a
variety of clinical situations. [Note: A number of antihistamines and antidepressants (mainly tricyclic

A.  Atropine
Atropine [A-troe-peen] is a tertiary amine extracted from belladonna alkaloid. It has a high affinity for muscarinic
receptors and binds competitively to prevent ACh from binding (Figure 5.3). Atropine acts both centrally and
peripherally. General actions last about 4 hours; however, effects of topical administration in the eye may persist for
days. Neuroeffector organs have varying sensitivity to atropine. The greatest inhibitory effects are seen in bronchial
tissue, salivary and sweat glands, and the heart.
Figure 5.3 Competition of atropine and scopolamine with acetylcholine for the
muscarinic receptor.
1.  Actions
a.  Eye
Atropine blocks muscarinic activity in the eye, resulting in mydriasis (dilation of the pupil), unresponsiveness to
light, and cycloplegia (inability to focus for near vision). In patients with angle-closure glaucoma, intraocular
pressure may rise dangerously.
b.  Gastrointestinal (GI)
Atropine (as the active isomer, L-hyoscyamine [hi-oh-SYE-uh-meen]) can be used as an antispasmodic to reduce
activity of the GI tract. Atropine and scopolamine (discussed below) are probably the most potent antispasmodic
drugs available. Although gastric motility is reduced, hydrochloric acid production is not significantly affected.
Thus, atropine is not effective for the treatment of ulcers. Doses of atropine that reduce spasms also reduce saliva
secretion, ocular accommodation, and urination. These effects decrease compliance with atropine.
c.  Cardiovascular
Atropine produces divergent effects on the cardiovascular system, depending on the dose (Figure 5.4). At low doses,
the predominant effect is a slight decrease in heart rate. This effect results from blockade of M1 receptors on the
inhibitory prejunctional (or presynaptic) neurons, thus permitting increased ACh release. Higher doses of atropine
cause a progressive increase in heart rate by blocking M2 receptors on the sinoatrial node.

--- PAGE 186 ---

Figure 5.4 Dose-dependent effects of atropine.
d.  Secretions
Atropine blocks muscarinic receptors in the salivary glands, producing dryness of the mouth (xerostomia). The
salivary glands are exquisitely sensitive to atropine. Sweat and lacrimal glands are similarly affected. [Note:
Inhibition of secretions of sweat glands can cause elevated body temperature, which can be dangerous in children
and the elderly.]
2.  Therapeutic uses
a.  Ophthalmic
Topical atropine exerts both mydriatic and cycloplegic effects, and it permits the measurement of refractive errors
without interference by the accommodative capacity of the eye. Shorter-acting antimuscarinics (cyclopentolate [sye-
kloe-PEN-toe-late] and tropicamide [troe-PIK-a-mide]) have largely replaced atropine due to prolonged mydriasis
observed with atropine (7 to 14 days vs. 6 to 24 hours with other agents). [Note: Phenylephrine or similar α-
adrenergic drugs are preferred for pupillary dilation if cycloplegia is not required.]
b.  Antispasmodic
Atropine is used as an antispasmodic agent to relax the GI tract.
c.  Cardiovascular
Injectable atropine is used to treat bradycardia of varying etiologies.
d.  Antisecretory
Atropine is sometimes used as an antisecretory agent to block secretions in the respiratory tract prior to surgery.
[Note: Glycopyrrolate (see below) is also used for this indication.]
e.  Antidote for cholinergic agonists
186
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 187 ---

Atropine is used for the treatment of organophosphate (insecticides, nerve gases) poisoning, of overdose of clinically
used anticholinesterases such as physostigmine, and in some types of mushroom poisoning (certain mushrooms
contain cholinergic substances that block cholinesterases). Massive doses of injectable atropine may be required
over a long period to counteract the poisons. The ability of atropine to enter the central nervous system (CNS) is of
particular importance in treating central toxic effects of anticholinesterases.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
Atropine is readily absorbed, partially metabolized by the liver, and eliminated primarily in urine. It has a half-life of
about 4 hours.
4.  Adverse effects
Depending on the dose, atropine may cause dry mouth, blurred vision, “sandy eyes,” tachycardia, urinary retention,
and constipation. Effects on the CNS include restlessness, confusion, hallucinations, and delirium, which may
progress to depression, collapse of the circulatory and respiratory systems, and death. Low doses of cholinesterase
inhibitors, such as physostigmine, may be used to overcome atropine toxicity. Atropine may also induce
troublesome urinary retention. The drug may be dangerous in children, because they are sensitive to its effects,
particularly to rapid increases in body temperature.

B.  Scopolamine
Scopolamine [skoe-POL-a-meen], another tertiary amine plant alkaloid, produces peripheral effects similar to those
of atropine. However, scopolamine has greater action on the CNS (unlike atropine, CNS effects are observed at
therapeutic doses) and a longer duration of action as compared to atropine. It has some special actions as indicated
below.
1.  Actions
Scopolamine is one of the most effective drugs available for motion sickness (Figure 5.5). It also has the unusual
effect of blocking short-term memory. In contrast to atropine, scopolamine produces sedation, but at higher doses, it
can produce excitement. Scopolamine may produce euphoria and is susceptible to abuse.
Figure 5.5 Scopolamine is an effective agent for motion sickness.
2.  Therapeutic uses
Scopolamine is used for the prevention of motion sickness and postoperative nausea and vomiting. For motion
sickness, it is available as a topical patch that provides effects for up to 3 days. [Note: As with all drugs used for
motion sickness, it is much more effective prophylactically than for treating motion sickness once it occurs.]
3.  Pharmacokinetics and adverse effects
These aspects are similar to those of atropine, with the exception of longer half-life.

C.  Aclidinium , glycopyrrolate, ipratropium , and tiotropium
Ipratropium [i-pra-TROE-pee-um] and tiotropium [TYE-oh-TROE-pee-um] are quaternary derivatives of atropine,
and glycopyrrolate [glye-koe-PYE-roe-late] and aclidinium [a-kli-DIN-ee-um] are synthetic quaternary compounds.
Ipratropium is classified as a short-acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA), while glycopyrrolate, tiotropium, and
aclidinium are classified as long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) based on the duration of action. These
agents are approved as bronchodilators for maintenance treatment of bronchospasm associated with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Ipratropium and tiotropium are also used in the acute management of
bronchospasm in asthma and chronic management of asthma, respectively (see Chapter 39). All of these agents are
delivered via inhalation. Because of the positive charge, these drugs do not enter the systemic circulation or the
CNS, restricting effects to the pulmonary system.

--- PAGE 190 ---

D.  Tropicamide and cyclopentolate
These agents are used as ophthalmic solutions for mydriasis and cycloplegia. Their duration of action is shorter than
that of atropine. Tropicamide produces mydriasis for 6 hours and cyclopentolate for 24 hours.

E.  Benztropine and trihexyphenidyl
Benztropine and trihexyphenidyl  are useful as adjuncts with other antiparkinson agents to treat Parkinson disease

F.  Oxybutynin and other antimuscarinic agents for overactive
bladder
Oxybutynin [ox-i-BYOO-ti-nin], darifenacin [dar-e-FEN-a-sin], fesoterodine [fes-oh-TER-oh-deen], solifenacin
[sol-ee-FEN-a-sin], tolterodine [tol-TER-oh-deen], and trospium [TROSE-pee-um] are synthetic atropine-like drugs
with antimuscarinic actions.
1.  Actions
By competitively blocking muscarinic (M3) receptors in the bladder, intravesical pressure is lowered, bladder
capacity is increased, and the frequency of bladder contractions is reduced. Antimuscarinic actions at M3 receptors
in the GI tract, salivary glands, CNS, and eye may cause adverse effects. Darifenacin and solifenacin are relatively
more selective M3 muscarinic receptor antagonists; however, the other drugs are mainly nonselective muscarinic
antagonists, and binding to other muscarinic receptor subtypes may contribute to adverse effects.
2.  Therapeutic uses
These agents are used for management of overactive bladder and urinary incontinence. Oxybutynin is also used in
patients with neurogenic bladder.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
All of the agents are available in oral dosage forms. Most agents have a long half-life, which allows once-daily
administration. [Note: Immediate-release oxybutynin and tolterodine must be dosed two or more times daily;
however, extended-release formulations of these agents allow for once-daily dosing.] Oxybutynin is also available in
a transdermal patch and topical gel formulation. These drugs are hepatically metabolized by the cytochrome P450
system (primarily CYP 3A4 and 2D6), with the exception of trospium, which is thought to undergo ester hydrolysis.
4.  Adverse effects
Side effects include dry mouth, constipation, and blurred vision, which limit tolerability of these agents. Extended-
release formulations and the transdermal patch have a lower incidence of adverse effects and may be better tolerated.
Trospium is a quaternary compound that minimally crosses the blood–brain barrier and has fewer CNS effects than
do other agents, making it a preferred choice in treating overactive bladder in patients with dementia. Important
characteristics of the muscarinic antagonists are summarized in Figures 5.6 and 5.7.

III.  Ganglionic Blockers
Ganglionic blockers specifically act on the nicotinic receptors of both parasympathetic and sympathetic autonomic
ganglia. Some also block the ion channels of the autonomic ganglia. These drugs show no selectivity toward the
parasympathetic or sympathetic ganglia and are not effective as neuromuscular antagonists. Thus, these drugs block
the entire output of the autonomic nervous system at the nicotinic receptor. Except for nicotine, the other drugs
mentioned in this category are nondepolarizing, competitive antagonists. The responses of the nondepolarizing
blockers are complex and mostly unpredictable. Therefore, ganglionic blockade is rarely used therapeutically, but
often serves as a tool in experimental pharmacology.
196

--- PAGE 197 ---

A.  Nicotine
A component of cigarette smoke, nicotine [NIK-oh-teen] is a poison with many undesirable actions. It is without
therapeutic benefit and is deleterious to health. Depending on the dose, nicotine depolarizes autonomic ganglia,
resulting first in stimulation and then in paralysis of all ganglia. The stimulatory effects are complex and result from
increased release of neurotransmitters (Figure 5.8), due to effects on both sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia
(see Chapter 15 for a full discussion of nicotine).

IV.  Neuromuscular Blocking Agents
These drugs block cholinergic transmission between motor nerve endings and the nicotinic receptors on skeletal
muscle (Figure 5.2). They possess some chemical similarities to ACh and act either as antagonists (nondepolarizing)
or as agonists (depolarizing) at the receptors on the endplate of the NMJ. Neuromuscular blockers (NMBs) are
clinically useful to facilitate rapid intubation when needed due to respiratory failure (rapid sequence intubation).
During surgery, they are used to facilitate endotracheal intubation and provide complete muscle relaxation at lower
anesthetic doses. This increases the safety of anesthesia by allowing patients to recover quickly and completely.
NMBs should not substitute for inadequate anesthesia. NMBs are also used in the intensive care unit (ICU) as
adjuvant therapy to facilitate intubation and mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients.
200
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 201 ---

A.  Nondepolarizing (competitive) blockers
The first known NMB was curare [kyoo-RAH-ree], which Amazon hunters used to paralyze prey. The development
of tubocurarine [too-boe-kyoo-AR-een] followed, but it has been replaced by agents with fewer adverse effects,
such as cisatracurium [cis-a-trah-CURE-ih-um], mivacurium [mi-vah-KYOO-ree-um], pancuronium [pan-kure-OH-
nee-um], rocuronium [roe-kyoor-OH-nee-um], and vecuronium [ve-KYOO-roe-nee-um].
1.  Mechanism of action
a.  At low doses
NMBs competitively block ACh at the nicotinic receptors (Figure 5.9). They compete with ACh at the receptor
without stimulating it, thus preventing depolarization of the muscle cell membrane and inhibiting muscular
contraction. Their competitive action can be overcome by administration of cholinesterase inhibitors, such as
neostigmine and edrophonium, which increase the concentration of ACh in the NMJ. Clinicians employ this strategy
to shorten the duration of neuromuscular blockade. In addition, at low doses the muscle responds to direct electrical
stimulation from a peripheral nerve stimulator to varying degrees, allowing for monitoring of the extent of
neuromuscular blockade.
Figure 5.9 Mechanism of action of competitive neuromuscular blocking drugs.
b.  At high doses
Nondepolarizing agents can block the ion channels of the motor end plate. This leads to further weakening of
neuromuscular transmission, reducing the ability of cholinesterase inhibitors to reverse the actions of the
nondepolarizing blockers. With complete blockade, the muscle does not respond to direct electrical stimulation.
2.  Actions
Muscles have differing sensitivity to blockade by competitive agents. Small, rapidly contracting muscles of the face
and eye are most susceptible and are paralyzed first, followed by the fingers, limbs, neck, and trunk muscles. Next,
the intercostal muscles are affected and, lastly, the diaphragm. The muscles recover in the reverse manner. [Note:
Sugammadex is a selective relaxant-binding agent that terminates the action of both rocuronium and vecuronium and
can be used to speed recovery (see Chapter 13).]
3.  Pharmacokinetics
All NMBs are injected intravenously or occasionally intramuscularly. These agents possess two or more quaternary
amines in their bulky ring structure that prevent absorption from the gut. They penetrate membranes very poorly and
do not enter cells or cross the blood–brain barrier. Drug action is terminated in a variety of ways ( Figure 5.10).
Pancuronium is excreted unchanged in urine. Cisatracurium undergoes organ-independent metabolism (via
Hofmann elimination) to laudanosine, which is further metabolized and renally excreted. The amino steroid drugs
vecuronium and rocuronium are deacetylated in the liver and excreted unchanged in bile. Mivacurium is eliminated
by plasma cholinesterase. The choice of agent depends on the desired onset and duration of muscle relaxation and
the route of elimination. Characteristics of the neuromuscular-blocking drugs are shown in Figure 5.11.

Figure 5.11 Characteristics of neuromuscular blocking drugs.
4.  Adverse effects
In general, these agents are safe with minimal side effects. The adverse effects of the specific NMBs are shown in
Figure 5.11.
5.  Drug interactions
a.  Cholinesterase inhibitors
Drugs such as neostigmine, physostigmine, pyridostigmine, and edrophonium can overcome the action of
nondepolarizing NMBs. However, with increased dosage, cholinesterase inhibitors can cause a depolarizing block
due to elevated ACh concentrations at the end plate membrane. If the NMB has entered the ion channel (is bound to
the receptor), cholinesterase inhibitors are not as effective in overcoming blockade.
b.  Halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics
Drugs such as desflurane act to enhance neuromuscular blockade by exerting a stabilizing action at the NMJ. These
agents sensitize the NMJ to the effects of NMBs.
c.  Aminoglycoside antibiotics
Drugs such as gentamicin and tobramycin inhibit ACh release from cholinergic nerves by competing with calcium
ions. They synergize with competitive blockers, enhancing neuromuscular blockade.
d.  Calcium channel blockers
These agents may increase the neuromuscular blockade of competitive blockers.
204
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 205 ---

B.  Depolarizing agents
Depolarizing blocking agents work by depolarizing the plasma membrane of the muscle fiber, similar to the action
of ACh. However, these agents are more resistant to degradation by acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and can more
persistently depolarize the muscle fibers. Succinylcholine [suk-sin-il-KOE-leen] is the only depolarizing muscle
relaxant in use today.
1.  Mechanism of action
Succinylcholine attaches to the nicotinic receptor and acts like ACh to depolarize the junction ( Figure 5.12). Unlike
ACh, which is instantly destroyed by AChE, the depolarizing agent persists at high concentrations in the synaptic
cleft, remaining attached to the receptor for a longer time and providing sustained depolarization of the muscle cell.
[Note: The duration of action is dependent on diffusion from the motor end plate and hydrolysis by plasma
cholinesterase (also called butyrylcholinesterase or pseudocholinesterase). Genetic variants in which plasma
cholinesterase levels are low or absent lead to prolonged neuromuscular paralysis.] The depolarizing agent first
causes opening of the sodium channel associated with nicotinic receptors, which results in depolarization of the
receptor (phase I). This leads to a transient twitching of the muscle (fasciculations). Continued binding of the
depolarizing agent renders the receptor incapable of transmitting further impulses. With time, continuous
depolarization gives way to gradual repolarization as the sodium channel closes or is blocked. This causes a
resistance to depolarization (phase II) and flaccid paralysis.

www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 207 ---

2.  Actions
As with the competitive blockers, the respiratory muscles are paralyzed last. Succinylcholine initially produces brief
muscle fasciculations that cause muscle soreness. This may be prevented by administering a small dose of
nondepolarizing NMB prior to succinylcholine. Normally, the duration of action of succinylcholine is extremely
short, due to rapid hydrolysis by plasma cholinesterase. However, succinylcholine that reaches the NMJ is not
metabolized, allowing the agent to bind to nicotinic receptors, and redistribution to plasma is necessary for
metabolism.
3.  Therapeutic uses
Because of its rapid onset of action, succinylcholine is useful when rapid endotracheal intubation is required. It is
also used during electroconvulsive shock treatment.
4.  Pharmacokinetics
Succinylcholine is injected intravenously. Its brief duration of action results from redistribution and rapid hydrolysis
by plasma cholinesterase. Drug effects rapidly disappear upon discontinuation.
5.  Adverse effects
a.  Hyperthermia
Succinylcholine can potentially induce malignant hyperthermia in susceptible patients (see Chapter 13).
b.  Apnea
Administration of succinylcholine to a patient who is deficient in plasma cholinesterase or has an atypical form of
the enzyme can lead to prolonged apnea due to paralysis of the diaphragm. The rapid release of potassium may also
contribute to prolonged apnea in patients with electrolyte imbalances. In patients with electrolyte imbalances
receiving digoxin or diuretics (such as heart failure patients) succinylcholine should be used cautiously or not at all.
c.  Hyperkalemia
Succinylcholine increases potassium release from intracellular stores. This may be particularly dangerous in burn
patients and patients with massive tissue damage in which potassium has been rapidly lost or in patients with renal
failure.

5.5Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
During an ophthalmic surgical procedure, the surgeon wanted to constrict the pupil using a miotic drug.
However, he accidentally used another drug that caused dilation of the pupil (mydriasis). Which drug was
most likely used?
A.  Acetylcholine
B.  Pilocarpine
C.  Tropicamide
D.  Bethanechol
Correct answer = C. Muscarinic agonists such as ACh, pilocarpine, and bethanechol contract the circular muscles
of iris sphincter and cause constriction of the pupil (miosis), whereas muscarinic antagonists such as tropicamide
prevent contraction of the circular muscles of the iris and cause dilation of the pupil (mydriasis).
Sarin is a nerve gas that is an organophosphate cholinesterase inhibitor. Which agent could be used as an
antidote to sarin poisoning?
A.  Pilocarpine
B.  Carbachol
C.  Atropine
D.  Physostigmine
Correct answer = C. Sarin is an organophosphate cholinesterase inhibitor. It causes an increase in ACh levels in
tissues that leads to cholinergic crisis through activation of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. Most symptoms of
cholinergic crisis are mediated by muscarinic receptors and, therefore, the muscarinic antagonist atropine is used
as an antidote for sarin poisoning. Cholinergic agonists such as pilocarpine, carbachol, and physostigmine
(indirect agonists) worsen symptoms of sarin poisoning.
A patient with Alzheimer disease needs treatment for overactive bladder (OAB). Which drug is the best
choice for this patient?
A.  Darifenacin
B.  Solifenacin
C.  Tolterodine
D.  Trospium
Correct answer = D. All of agents for OAB except trospium cross the blood–brain barrier to various degrees and
could worsen dementia symptoms in Alzheimer disease. Trospium is a quaternary ammonium compound that
minimally crosses the blood–brain barrier.
A patient with asthma was prescribed a β2 agonist for acute relief of bronchospasm, but did not respond to
treatment. Which drug is the most likely next option for this patient?
A.  Benztropine
B.  Ipratropium
C.  Oxybutynin
D.  Physostigmine
Correct answer = B. Major receptors present in the bronchial tissues are muscarinic and adrenergic β2 receptors.
Muscarinic activation causes bronchoconstriction, and β2 receptor activation causes bronchodilation. Therefore,
direct or indirect (physostigmine) muscarinic agonists worsen bronchospasm. Ipratropium is a muscarinic
antagonist that can relax bronchial smooth muscles and relieve bronchospasm in patients who are not responsive
to β2 agonists. Benztropine is used in the treatment of Parkinson disease or relief of extrapyramidal symptoms
from antipsychotics. Oxybutynin is used for overactive bladder.
A 50-year-old male who is noncompliant with medications was recently diagnosed with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD). His physician would like to prescribe an inhaled anticholinergic that is dosed
once or twice daily. Which drug is most appropriate for this patient?
A.  Atropine
B.  Ipratropium
C.  Tiotropium
D.  Trospium
Correct answer = C. The physician should prescribe a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) so that the
patient has to inhale the medication only 1 or 2 times daily. Tiotropium is a LAMA, whereas ipratropium is a
short-acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA). Atropine and trospium are muscarinic antagonists, but are not
indicated for pulmonary conditions such as asthma or COPD and are not available as inhaled formulations.208

5.10Which is the most effective drug for motion sickness for a person planning to go on a cruise?
A.  Atropine
B.  Fesoterodine
C.  Scopolamine
D.  Tropicamide
Correct answer = C. All muscarinic antagonists (anticholinergic drugs) listed are theoretically useful as
antimotion sickness drugs; however, scopolamine is the most effective in preventing motion sickness.
Tropicamide mostly has ophthalmic uses, and fesoterodine is used for overactive bladder.
Which is correct regarding ganglion-blocking drugs?
A.  Blockade of sympathetic ganglia could result in reduced blood pressure.
B.  Blockade of parasympathetic ganglia could result in reduced heart rate.
C.  Nicotine is a nondepolarizing ganglion blocker.
D.  Atropine is a nondepolarizing ganglion blocker.
Correct answer = A. Selective blockade (in theory) of the sympathetic ganglion causes reduction in
norepinephrine release and, therefore, reduction in heart rate and blood pressure. Selective blockade (in theory) of
the parasympathetic ganglion causes reduction in ACh release and an increase in heart rate. Receptors at both
sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia are of the nicotinic type. Nicotine is an agonist at nicotinic receptors
and produces a depolarizing block in the ganglia. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist and has no effect on the
nicotinic receptors found in the ganglia.
Which drug is useful in treating sinus bradycardia?
A.  Atropine
B.  Cisatracurium
C.  Neostigmine
D.  Succinylcholine
Correct answer = A. Sinus bradycardia is a condition where the heart rate is below normal and most often caused
by increased vagal tone (increased release of ACh in the sinoatrial [SA] node that acts on muscarinic receptors to
reduce heart rate). A muscarinic antagonist such as atropine is useful in this situation to bring the heart rate back
to normal. Succinylcholine and cisatracurium are nicotinic antagonists and have no effect on muscarinic receptors
in the SA node. Neostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor and can worsen bradycardia by increasing the level of
ACh in the SA node.
An ICU patient with severe lung injury requires a neuromuscular blocking agent to assist in his ventilator
management. He has liver disease and is currently in renal failure. Which neuromuscular blocker is the best
choice for this patient?
A.  Cisatracurium
B.  Pancuronium
C.  Vecuronium
D.  Rocuronium
Correct answer = A. Pancuronium is renally eliminated and the patient has renal failure. Vecuronium and
rocuronium are hepatically metabolized and the patient has liver disease. Cisatracurium is cleared by organ-
independent metabolism (Hofmann elimination).
Where would you expect to see the first return of function in skeletal muscles following discontinuation of a
nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent?
A.  Arms
B.  Diaphragm
C.  Fingers
D.  Pupils
Correct answer = B. Following administration of a neuromuscular blocker, the facial muscles are impacted first,
but the pupils are not controlled by skeletal muscle and are not affected. The fingers and arms would be next, with
the diaphragm function lost last. Function returns in the opposite order, so function of the diaphragm returns first.209

Adrenergic Agonists

I.  Overview
The adrenergic drugs affect receptors that are stimulated by norepinephrine (noradrenaline) or epinephrine
(adrenaline). These receptors are known as adrenergic receptors or adrenoceptors. Drugs that activate adrenergic
receptors are termed sympathomimetics, and drugs that block activation of adrenergic receptors are termed
sympatholytics. Some sympathomimetics directly activate adrenergic receptors (direct-acting agonists), while others
act indirectly by enhancing release or blocking reuptake of norepinephrine (indirect-acting agonists). This chapter
describes agents that either directly or indirectly stimulate adrenoceptors ( Figure 6.1). Sympatholytic drugs are
discussed in Chapter 7.

II.  The Adrenergic Neuron
Adrenergic neurons release norepinephrine as the primary neurotransmitter. These neurons are found in the central
nervous system (CNS) and in the sympathetic nervous system, where they serve as links between ganglia and the
effector organs. Adrenergic drugs act on adrenergic receptors, located either presynaptically on the neuron or
postsynaptically on the effector organ (Figure 6.2).
Figure 6.2 Sites of actions of adrenergic agonists.

--- PAGE 214 ---

A.  Neurotransmission at adrenergic neurons
Neurotransmission in adrenergic neurons closely resembles that described for the cholinergic neurons (see Chapter
4), except that norepinephrine is the neurotransmitter instead of acetylcholine. Neurotransmission involves the
following steps: synthesis, storage, release, and receptor binding of norepinephrine, followed by removal of the
neurotransmitter from the synaptic gap (Figure 6.3).
Figure 6.3 Synthesis and release of norepinephrine from the adrenergic neuron. DOPA =
dihydroxyphenylalanine; MAO = monoamine oxidase; NE = norepinephrine; SNRI =
serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor.
1.  Synthesis of norepinephrine
Tyrosine is transported by a carrier into the adrenergic neuron, where it is hydroxylated to dihydroxyphenylalanine
(DOPA) by tyrosine hydroxylase. This is the rate-limiting step in the formation of norepinephrine. DOPA is then
decarboxylated by the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase to form dopamine in the presynaptic neuron.
2.  Storage of norepinephrine in vesicles
Dopamine is then transported into synaptic vesicles by an amine transporter system. This carrier system is blocked
by reserpine (see Chapter 7). Next, dopamine is hydroxylated to form norepinephrine by the enzyme dopamine β-
hydroxylase.
3.  Release of norepinephrine
An action potential arriving at the nerve junction triggers an influx of calcium ions from the extracellular fluid into
the cytoplasm of the neuron. The increase in calcium causes synaptic vesicles to fuse with the cell membrane and to
undergo exocytosis and expel their contents into the synapse. Drugs such as guanethidine block this release.
4.  Binding to receptors
Norepinephrine released from the synaptic vesicles diffuses into the synaptic space and binds to postsynaptic214
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 215 ---

receptors on the effector organ or to presynaptic receptors on the nerve ending. Binding of norepinephrine to
receptors triggers a cascade of events within the cell, resulting in the formation of intracellular second messengers
that act as links (transducers) in the communication between the neurotransmitter and the action generated within the
effector cell. Adrenergic receptors use both the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) second messenger system
and the phosphatidylinositol cycle to transduce the signal into an effect. Norepinephrine also binds to presynaptic
receptors (mainly α2 subtype) that modulate the release of the neurotransmitter.
5.  Removal of norepinephrine
Norepinephrine may 1) diffuse out of the synaptic space and enter the systemic circulation, 2) be metabolized to
inactive metabolites by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) in the synaptic space, or 3) undergo reuptake back
into the neuron. The reuptake by the neuronal membrane involves a sodium–chloride (Na+/Cl−)–dependent
norepinephrine transporter that can be inhibited by tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), such as imipramine; by
serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors such as duloxetine; or by cocaine. Reuptake of norepinephrine into the
presynaptic neuron is the primary mechanism for termination of its effects.
6.  Potential fates of recaptured norepinephrine
Once norepinephrine reenters the adrenergic neuron, it may be taken up into synaptic vesicles via the amine
transporter system and be sequestered for release by another action potential, or it may persist in a protected pool in
the cytoplasm. Alternatively, norepinephrine can be oxidized by monoamine oxidase (MAO) present in neuronal
mitochondria.

B.  Adrenergic receptors (adrenoceptors)
In the sympathetic nervous system, several classes of adrenoceptors can be distinguished pharmacologically. Two
main families of receptors, designated α and β, are classified based on response to the adrenergic agonists
epinephrine, norepinephrine, and isoproterenol . Both the α and β receptor types have a number of specific receptor
subtypes. Alterations in the primary structure of the receptors influence their affinity for various agents.
1.  α-Adrenoceptors
The α-adrenoceptors show a weak response to the synthetic agonist isoproterenol , but they are responsive to the
naturally occurring catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine (Figure 6.4). For α receptors, the rank order of
potency and affinity is epinephrine ≥ norepinephrine >> isoproterenol . The α-adrenoceptors are divided into two
subtypes, α1 and α2, based on their affinities for α agonists and antagonists. For example, α1 receptors have a higher
affinity for phenylephrine than α2 receptors. Conversely, the drug clonidine selectively binds to α2 receptors and has
less effect on α1 receptors.
216
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 217 ---

Figure 6.4 Types of adrenergic receptors.
a.  α1 Receptors
These receptors are present on the postsynaptic membrane of the effector organs and mediate many of the classic
effects, originally designated as α-adrenergic, involving constriction of smooth muscle. Activation of α1 receptors
initiates a series of reactions through the G-protein activation of phospholipase C, ultimately resulting in the
generation of second messengers inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 initiates the
release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol, and DAG turns on other proteins within the cell
(Figure 6.5).
217
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 218 ---

Figure 6.5 Second messengers mediate the effects of α receptors. DAG = diacylglycerol;
IP3 = inositol trisphosphate; ATP = adenosine triphosphate; cAMP = cyclic adenosine
monophosphate.
b.  α2 Receptors
These receptors are located primarily on sympathetic presynaptic nerve endings and control the release of
norepinephrine. When a sympathetic adrenergic nerve is stimulated, a portion of the released norepinephrine “circles
back” and reacts with α2 receptors on the presynaptic membrane (Figure 6.5). Stimulation of α2 receptors causes
feedback inhibition and inhibits further release of norepinephrine from the stimulated adrenergic neuron. This
inhibitory action serves as a local mechanism for modulating norepinephrine output when there is high sympathetic 218
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 219 ---

activity. [Note: In this instance, by inhibiting further output of norepinephrine from the adrenergic neuron, these
receptors are acting as inhibitory autoreceptors.] α2 Receptors are also found on presynaptic parasympathetic
neurons. Norepinephrine released from a presynaptic sympathetic neuron can diffuse to and interact with these
receptors, inhibiting acetylcholine release. [Note: In these instances, these receptors are behaving as inhibitory
heteroreceptors.] This is another mechanism to modulate autonomic activity in a given area. In contrast to α1
receptors, the effects of binding at α2 receptors are mediated by inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and by a fall in the
levels of intracellular cAMP.
c.  Further subdivisions
The α1 and α2 receptors are further divided into α1A, α1B, α1C, and α1D and into α2A, α2B, and α2C. This extended
classification is necessary for understanding the selectivity of some drugs. For example, tamsulosin is a selective α1A
antagonist that is used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia. The drug has fewer cardiovascular side effects because it
targets α1A subtype receptors found primarily in the urinary tract and prostate gland and does not affect the α1B
subtype found in the blood vessels.
2.  β-Adrenoceptors
Responses of β receptors differ from those of α receptors and are characterized by a strong response to
isoproterenol , with less sensitivity to epinephrine and norepinephrine (Figure 6.4). For β receptors, the rank order of
potency is isoproterenol  > epinephrine > norepinephrine. The β-adrenoceptors can be subdivided into three major
subgroups, β1, β2, and β3, based on their affinities for adrenergic agonists and antagonists. β1 receptors have
approximately equal affinities for epinephrine and norepinephrine, whereas β2 receptors have a higher affinity for
epinephrine than for norepinephrine. Thus, tissues with a predominance of β2 receptors (such as the vasculature of
skeletal muscle) are particularly responsive to the effects of circulating epinephrine released by the adrenal medulla.
Binding of a neurotransmitter at any of the three types of β receptors results in activation of adenylyl cyclase and
increased concentrations of cAMP within the cell.
3.  Distribution of receptors
Adrenergically innervated organs and tissues usually have a predominant type of receptor. For example, tissues such
as the vasculature of skeletal muscle have both α1 and β2 receptors, but the β2 receptors predominate. Other tissues
may have one type of receptor almost exclusively. For example, the heart contains predominantly β1 receptors.
4.  Characteristic responses mediated by adrenoceptors
It is useful to organize the physiologic responses to adrenergic stimulation according to receptor type, because many
drugs preferentially stimulate or block one type of receptor. Figure 6.6 summarizes the most prominent effects
mediated by the adrenoceptors. As a generalization, stimulation of α1 receptors characteristically produces
vasoconstriction (particularly in skin and abdominal viscera) and an increase in total peripheral resistance and blood
pressure. Stimulation of β1 receptors characteristically causes cardiac stimulation (increase in heart rate and
contractility), whereas stimulation of β2 receptors produces vasodilation (in skeletal muscle vascular beds) and
smooth muscle relaxation. β3 Receptors are involved in lipolysis (along with β1), and also have effects on the
detrusor muscle of the bladder.
Figure 6.6 Major effects mediated by α- and β-adrenoceptors.
5.  Desensitization of receptors
Prolonged exposure to the catecholamines reduces the responsiveness of these receptors, a phenomenon known as
desensitization. Three mechanisms have been suggested to explain this phenomenon: 1) sequestration of the
receptors so that they are unavailable for interaction with the ligand; 2) down-regulation, that is, a disappearance of
the receptors either by destruction or by decreased synthesis; and 3) an inability to couple to G-protein, because the
receptor has been phosphorylated on the cytoplasmic side.

III.  Characteristics of Adrenergic Agonists
Most adrenergic drugs are derivatives of β-phenylethylamine (Figure 6.7). Substitutions on the benzene ring or on
the ethylamine side chains produce a variety of compounds with varying abilities to differentiate between α and β
receptors and to penetrate the CNS. Two important structural features of these drugs are 1) the number and location
of OH substitutions on the benzene ring and 2) the nature of the substituent on the amino nitrogen.

catechol ring are shown in yellow .

--- PAGE 224 ---

A.  Catecholamines
Sympathomimetic amines that contain the 3,4-dihydroxybenzene group (such as epinephrine, norepinephrine,
isoproterenol , and dopamine) are called catecholamines. These compounds share the following properties:
1.  High potency
Catecholamines show the highest potency in directly activating α or β receptors.
2.  Rapid inactivation
Catecholamines are metabolized by COMT postsynaptically and by MAO intraneuronally, by COMT and MAO in
the gut wall, and by MAO in the liver. Thus, catecholamines have only a brief period of action when given
parenterally, and they are inactivated (ineffective) when administered orally.
3.  Poor penetration into the CNS
Catecholamines are polar and, therefore, do not readily penetrate into the CNS. Nevertheless, most catecholamines
have some clinical effects (anxiety, tremor, and headaches) that are attributable to action on the CNS.
224
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 225 ---

B.  Noncatecholamines
Compounds lacking the catechol hydroxyl groups have longer half-lives, because they are not inactivated by COMT.
These include phenylephrine, ephedrine, and amphetamine (Figure 6.7). These agents are poor substrates for MAO
(an important route of metabolism) and, thus, show a prolonged duration of action. Increased lipid solubility of
many of the noncatecholamines (due to lack of polar hydroxyl groups) permits greater access to the CNS.
225
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 226 ---

C.  Substitutions on the amine nitrogen
The nature of the substituent on the amine nitrogen is important in determining β selectivity of the adrenergic
agonist. For example, epinephrine, with a –CH3 substituent on the amine nitrogen, is more potent at β receptors than
norepinephrine, which has an unsubstituted amine. Similarly, isoproterenol , which has an isopropyl substituent –
CH(CH3)2 on the amine nitrogen (Figure 6.7), is a strong β agonist with little α activity (Figure 6.4).

--- PAGE 227 ---

D.  Mechanism of action of adrenergic agonists
1.  Direct-acting agonists
These drugs act directly on α or β receptors, producing effects similar to those that occur following stimulation of
sympathetic nerves or release of epinephrine from the adrenal medulla (Figure 6.8). Examples of direct-acting
agonists include epinephrine, norepinephrine, isoproterenol , dopamine, and phenylephrine.
Figure 6.8 Sites of action of direct-, indirect-, and mixed-acting adrenergic agonists.
2.  Indirect-acting agonists
These agents may block the reuptake of norepinephrine or cause the release of norepinephrine from the cytoplasmic
pools or vesicles of the adrenergic neuron (Figure 6.8). The norepinephrine then traverses the synapse and binds to α
or β receptors. Examples of reuptake inhibitors and agents that cause norepinephrine release include cocaine and
227
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 228 ---

amphetamine, respectively.
3.  Mixed-action agonists
Ephedrine and its stereoisomer, pseudoephedrine, both stimulate adrenoceptors directly and enhance release of
norepinephrine from the adrenergic neuron (Figure 6.8).
228

--- PAGE 229 ---

IV.  Direct-Acting Adrenergic Agonists
Direct-acting agonists bind to adrenergic receptors on effector organs without interacting with the presynaptic
neuron. As a group, these agents are widely used in clinical practice.

A.  Epinephrine
Epinephrine [ep-i-NEF-rin] is one of the four catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, and
dobutamine) commonly used in therapy. The first three are naturally occurring neurotransmitters, and the latter is a
synthetic compound. In the adrenal medulla, norepinephrine is methylated to yield epinephrine, which is stored in
chromaffin cells along with norepinephrine. On stimulation, the adrenal medulla releases about 80% epinephrine
and 20% norepinephrine directly into the circulation. Epinephrine interacts with both α and β receptors. At low
doses, β effects (vasodilation) on the vascular system predominate, whereas at high doses, α effects
(vasoconstriction) are the strongest.
1.  Actions
a.  Cardiovascular
The major actions of epinephrine are on the cardiovascular system. Epinephrine strengthens the contractility of the
myocardium (positive inotrope: β1 action) and increases its rate of contraction (positive chronotrope: β1 action).
Therefore, cardiac output increases. These effects increase oxygen demands on the myocardium. Epinephrine
activates β1 receptors on the kidney to cause renin release. Renin is an enzyme involved in the production of
angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. Epinephrine constricts arterioles in the skin, mucous membranes, and
viscera (α effects), and it dilates vessels going to the liver and skeletal muscle (β2 effects). These combined effects
result in a decrease in renal blood flow. Therefore, the cumulative effect is an increase in systolic blood pressure,
coupled with a slight decrease in diastolic pressure due to β2 receptor–mediated vasodilation in the skeletal muscle
vascular bed (Figure 6.9).
230
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 231 ---

Figure 6.9 Cardiovascular effects of intravenous infusion of low doses of epinephrine.
b.  Respiratory
Epinephrine causes powerful bronchodilation by acting directly on bronchial smooth muscle (β2 action). It also
inhibits the release of allergy mediators such as histamine from mast cells.
231
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 232 ---

c.  Hyperglycemia
Epinephrine has a significant hyperglycemic effect because of increased glycogenolysis in the liver (β2 effect),
increased release of glucagon (β2 effect), and a decreased release of insulin (α2 effect).
d.  Lipolysis
Epinephrine initiates lipolysis through agonist activity on the β receptors of adipose tissue. Increased levels of
cAMP stimulate a hormone-sensitive lipase, which hydrolyzes triglycerides to free fatty acids and glycerol.
2.  Therapeutic uses
a.  Bronchospasm
Epinephrine is the primary drug used in the emergency treatment of respiratory conditions when
bronchoconstriction has resulted in diminished respiratory function. Thus, in treatment of anaphylactic shock,
epinephrine is the drug of choice and can be lifesaving in this setting. Within a few minutes after subcutaneous
administration, respiratory function greatly improves.
a.  Anaphylactic shock
Epinephrine is the drug of choice for the treatment of type I hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) in
response to allergens.
a.  Cardiac arrest
Epinephrine may be used to restore cardiac rhythm in patients with cardiac arrest.
d.  Local anesthesia
Local anesthetic solutions may contain low concentrations (for example, 1:100,000 parts) of epinephrine.
Epinephrine greatly increases the duration of local anesthesia by producing vasoconstriction at the site of injection.
Epinephrine also reduces systemic absorption of the local anesthetic and promotes local hemostasis.
e.  Intraocular surgery
Epinephrine is used in the induction and maintenance of mydriasis during intraocular surgery.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
Epinephrine has a rapid onset but a brief duration of action (due to rapid degradation). The preferred route for
anaphylaxis in the outpatient setting is intramuscular (anterior thigh) due to rapid absorption. In emergencies,
epinephrine is given intravenously (IV) for the most rapid onset of action. It may also be given subcutaneously, by
endotracheal tube, or by inhalation (Figure 6.10). It is rapidly metabolized by MAO and COMT, and the metabolites
metanephrine and vanillylmandelic acid are excreted in urine.
Figure 6.10 Pharmacokinetics of epinephrine . CNS = central nervous system.
232
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 233 ---

4.  Adverse effects
Epinephrine can produce adverse CNS effects that include anxiety, fear, tension, headache, and tremor. It can trigger
cardiac arrhythmias, particularly if the patient is receiving digoxin. Epinephrine can also induce pulmonary edema
due to increased afterload caused by vasoconstrictive properties of the drug. Patients with hyperthyroidism may
have an increased production of adrenergic receptors in the vasculature, leading to an enhanced response to
epinephrine, and the dose must be reduced in these individuals. Inhalation anesthetics also sensitize the heart to the
effects of epinephrine, which may lead to tachycardia. Epinephrine increases the release of endogenous stores of
glucose. In diabetic patients, dosages of insulin may have to be increased. Nonselective β-blockers prevent
vasodilatory effects of epinephrine on β2 receptors, leaving α receptor stimulation unopposed. This may lead to
increased peripheral resistance and increased blood pressure.
233
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 234 ---

B.  Norepinephrine
Because norepinephrine [nor-ep-ih-NEF-rin] is the neurotransmitter in the adrenergic neurons, it should,
theoretically, stimulate all types of adrenergic receptors. However, when administered in therapeutic doses, the α-
adrenergic receptor is most affected.
1.  Cardiovascular actions
a.  Vasoconstriction
Norepinephrine causes a rise in peripheral resistance due to intense vasoconstriction of most vascular beds,
including the kidney (α1 effect). Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures increase ( Figure 6.11). [Note:
Norepinephrine causes greater vasoconstriction than epinephrine, because it does not induce compensatory
vasodilation via β2 receptors on blood vessels supplying skeletal muscles. The weak β2 activity of norepinephrine
also explains why it is not useful in the treatment of bronchospasm or anaphylaxis.]

Figure 6.11 Cardiovascular effects of intravenous infusion of norepinephrine.
b.  Baroreceptor reflex
Norepinephrine increases blood pressure, and this stimulates the baroreceptors, inducing a rise in vagal activity. The
increased vagal activity produces a reflex bradycardia, which is sufficient to counteract the local actions of
norepinephrine on the heart, although the reflex compensation does not affect the positive inotropic effects of the
drug (Figure 6.11). When atropine, which blocks the transmission of vagal effects, is given before norepinephrine,
stimulation of the heart by norepinephrine is evident as tachycardia.
2.  Therapeutic uses
Norepinephrine is used to treat shock (for example, septic shock), because it increases vascular resistance and,
therefore, increases blood pressure. It has no other clinically significant uses.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
Norepinephrine is given IV for rapid onset of action. The duration of action is 1 to 2 minutes, following the end of
the infusion. It is rapidly metabolized by MAO and COMT, and inactive metabolites are excreted in the urine.
4.  Adverse effects
These are similar to epinephrine. In addition, norepinephrine is a potent vasoconstrictor and may cause blanching
and sloughing of skin along an injected vein. If extravasation (leakage of drug from the vessel into tissues
surrounding the injection site) occurs, it can cause tissue necrosis. It should not be administered in peripheral veins,
if possible. Impaired circulation from norepinephrine may be treated with the α receptor antagonist phentolamine.
Alternatives to phentolamine include intradermal terbutaline and topical nitroglycerin.
236

--- PAGE 237 ---

C.  Isoproterenol
Isoproterenol  [eye-soe-proe-TER-e-nole] is a direct-acting synthetic catecholamine that stimulates both β1- and β2-
adrenergic receptors. Its nonselectivity is a disadvantage and the reason why it is rarely used therapeutically. Its
action on α receptors is insignificant. Isoproterenol  produces intense stimulation of the heart (β1 effect), increasing
heart rate, contractility, and cardiac output (Figure 6.12). It is as active as epinephrine in this action. Isoproterenol
also dilates the arterioles of skeletal muscle (β2 effect), resulting in decreased peripheral resistance. Because of its
cardiac stimulatory action, it may increase systolic blood pressure slightly, but it greatly reduces mean arterial and
diastolic blood pressures (Figure 6.12). Isoproterenol  is also a potent bronchodilator (β2 effect). The adverse effects
of isoproterenol  are similar to the β receptor–related side effects of epinephrine.

D.  Dopamine
Dopamine [DOE-pa-meen], the immediate metabolic precursor of norepinephrine, occurs naturally in the CNS in
the basal ganglia, where it functions as a neurotransmitter, as well as in the adrenal medulla. Dopamine can activate
α- and β-adrenergic receptors. For example, at higher doses, it causes vasoconstriction by activating α1 receptors,
whereas at lower doses, it stimulates β1 cardiac receptors. In addition, D1 and D2 dopaminergic receptors, distinct
from the α- and β-adrenergic receptors, occur in the peripheral mesenteric and renal vascular beds, where binding of
dopamine produces vasodilation. D2 receptors are also found on presynaptic adrenergic neurons, where their
activation interferes with norepinephrine release.
1.  Actions
a.  Cardiovascular
Dopamine exerts a stimulatory effect on the β1 receptors of the heart, having both positive inotropic and
chronotropic effects (Figure 6.13). At very high doses, dopamine activates α1 receptors on the vasculature, resulting
in vasoconstriction.

Figure 6.13 Clinically important actions of isoproterenol and dopamine.
b.  Renal and visceral
Dopamine dilates renal and splanchnic arterioles by activating dopaminergic receptors, thereby increasing blood
flow to the kidneys and other viscera (Figure 6.13). These receptors are not affected by α- or β-blocking drugs, and
in the past, low-dose (“renal-dose”) dopamine was often used in the prevention or treatment of acute renal failure.
However, more recent data suggest there is limited clinical utility in the renal protective effects of dopamine.
2.  Therapeutic uses
Dopamine can be used for cardiogenic and septic shock and is given by continuous infusion. It raises blood pressure
by stimulating the β1 receptors on the heart to increase cardiac output, and α1 receptors on blood vessels to increase
total peripheral resistance. It enhances perfusion to the kidney and splanchnic areas, as described above. Increased
blood flow to the kidney enhances the glomerular filtration rate and causes diuresis. By contrast, norepinephrine can
diminish blood supply to the kidney and may reduce renal function. Dopamine is also used to treat hypotension,
severe heart failure, and bradycardia unresponsive to other treatments.
3.  Adverse effects
An overdose of dopamine produces the same effects as sympathetic stimulation. Dopamine is rapidly metabolized
by MAO or COMT, and its adverse effects (nausea, hypertension, and arrhythmias) are, therefore, short lived.

E.  Fenoldopam
Fenoldopam [fen-OL-de-pam] is an agonist of peripheral dopamine D1 receptors. It is used as a rapid-acting
vasodilator to treat severe hypertension in hospitalized patients, acting on coronary arteries, kidney arterioles, and
mesenteric arteries. Fenoldopam is a racemic mixture, and the R-isomer is the active component. It undergoes
extensive first-pass metabolism and has a 10-minute elimination half-life after IV infusion. Headache, flushing,
dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and tachycardia (due to vasodilation) may occur with this agent.

F.  Dobutamine
Dobutamine [doe-BYOO-ta-meen] is a synthetic, direct-acting catecholamine that is primarily a β1 receptor agonist
with minor β2 and α1 effects. It increases heart rate and cardiac output with few vascular effects. Dobutamine is used
to increase cardiac output in acute heart failure (see Chapter 18), as well as for inotropic support after cardiac
surgery. The drug increases cardiac output and does not elevate oxygen demands of the myocardium as much as
other sympathomimetic drugs. Dobutamine should be used with caution in atrial fibrillation, because it increases
atrioventricular (AV) conduction. Other adverse effects are similar to epinephrine. Tolerance may develop with
prolonged use.

G.  Oxymetazoline
Oxymetazoline [OX-ee-mee-TAZ-ih-leen] is a direct-acting synthetic adrenergic agonist that stimulates both α1- and
α2-adrenergic receptors. Oxymetazoline is found in many over-the-counter nasal spray decongestants, as well as in
ophthalmic drops for the relief of redness of the eyes associated with swimming, colds, and contact lenses.
Oxymetazoline directly stimulates α receptors on blood vessels supplying the nasal mucosa and conjunctiva, thereby
producing vasoconstriction and decreasing congestion. It is absorbed in the systemic circulation regardless of the
route of administration and may produce nervousness, headaches, and trouble sleeping. Local irritation and sneezing
may occur with intranasal administration. Use for greater than 3 days is not recommended, as rebound congestion
and dependence may occur.

--- PAGE 246 ---

H.  Phenylephrine
Phenylephrine [fen-ill-EF-reen] is a direct-acting, synthetic adrenergic drug that binds primarily to α1 receptors.
Phenylephrine is a vasoconstrictor that raises both systolic and diastolic blood pressures. It has no effect on the heart
itself but, rather, induces reflex bradycardia when given parenterally, making it useful in the treatment of
paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. The drug is used to treat hypotension in hospitalized or surgical patients
(especially those with a rapid heart rate). Large doses can cause hypertensive headache and cardiac irregularities.
Phenylephrine acts as a nasal decongestant when applied topically or taken orally. Although data suggest it may not
be as effective, phenylephrine has replaced pseudoephedrine in many oral decongestants, since pseudoephedrine has
been misused to make methamphetamine. Phenylephrine is also used in ophthalmic solutions for mydriasis.

I.  Midodrine
Midodrine, a prodrug, is metabolized to the pharmacologically active desglymidodrine. It is a selective α1 agonist,
which acts in the periphery to increase arterial and venous tone. Midodrine is indicated for the treatment of
orthostatic hypotension. The drug should be given three times daily, with doses at 3- or 4-hour intervals. To avoid
supine hypertension, doses within 4 hours of bedtime are not recommended.

J.  Clonidine
Clonidine [KLOE-ni-deen] is an α2 agonist used for the treatment of hypertension. It can also be used to minimize
symptoms of withdrawal from opiates, tobacco smoking, and benzodiazepines. Both clonidine and the α2 agonist
guanfacine [GWAHN-fa-seen] may be used in the management of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Clonidine
acts centrally on presynaptic α2 receptors to produce inhibition of sympathetic vasomotor centers, decreasing
sympathetic outflow to the periphery. The most common side effects of clonidine are lethargy, sedation,
constipation, and xerostomia. Abrupt discontinuation must be avoided to prevent rebound hypertension. Clonidine
and another α2 agonist methyldopa are discussed with antihypertensives in Chapter 16.

K.  Albuterol, metaproterenol, and terbutaline
Albuterol  [al-BYOO-ter-ole], metaproterenol  [MET-a-proe-TER-e-nol], and terbutaline [ter-BYOO-te-leen] are
short-acting β2 agonists (SABAs) used primarily as bronchodilators and administered by a metered-dose inhaler
(Figure 6.14). Albuterol  is the SABA of choice for the management of acute asthma symptoms, because it is more
selective for β2 receptors than metaproterenol . Inhaled terbutaline is no longer available in the United States, but is
still used in other countries. Injectable terbutaline is used off-label as a uterine relaxant to suppress premature labor,
and use for this indication should not exceed 72 hours. One of the most common side effects of these agents is
tremor, but patients tend to develop tolerance to this effect. Other side effects include restlessness, apprehension,
and anxiety. When these drugs are administered orally, they may cause tachycardia or arrhythmia (due to β1 receptor
activation), especially in patients with underlying cardiac disease. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) also
increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular effects, and concomitant use should be avoided.

L.  Salmeterol, formoterol, and indacaterol
Salmeterol  [sal-ME-ter-ole], formoterol  [for-MOH-ter-ole], arformoterol  (the [R,R]-enantiomer of formoterol ), and
indacaterol  [IN-da-KA-ter-ol] are long-acting β2 selective agonists (LABAs) used for the management of
respiratory disorders such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (see Chapter 39). A single dose by a
metered-dose inhalation device, such as a dry powder inhaler, provides sustained bronchodilation over 12 hours,
compared with less than 3 hours for albuterol . Unlike formoterol , however, salmeterol  has a somewhat delayed
onset of action (Figure 6.14). LABAs are not recommended as monotherapy for the treatment of asthma, because
they have been shown to increase the risk of asthma-related deaths; however, these agents are highly efficacious
when combined with an asthma controller medication such as an inhaled corticosteroid.

M.  Mirabegron
Mirabegron [mir-a-BEG-ron] is a β3 agonist that relaxes the detrusor smooth muscle and increases bladder capacity.
It is used for patients with overactive bladder. Mirabegron may increase blood pressure and should not be used in
patients with uncontrolled hypertension. It increases levels of digoxin and inhibits the CYP2D6 isozyme, which may
enhance the effects of other medications metabolized by this pathway (for example, metoprolol ).

V.  Indirect-Acting Adrenergic Agonists
Indirect-acting adrenergic agonists cause the release, inhibit the reuptake, or inhibit the degradation of epinephrine
or norepinephrine (Figure 6.8). They potentiate the effects of epinephrine or norepinephrine produced endogenously,
but do not directly affect postsynaptic receptors.

--- PAGE 255 ---

A.  Amphetamine
The marked central stimulatory action of amphetamine [am-FET-a-meen] is often mistaken by drug abusers as its
only action. However, the drug can also increase blood pressure significantly by α1 agonist action on the
vasculature, as well as β1 stimulatory effects on the heart. Its actions are mediated primarily through an increase in
nonvesicular release of catecholamines such as dopamine and norepinephrine from nerve terminals. Thus,
amphetamine is an indirect-acting adrenergic drug. The actions and therapeutic uses of amphetamine and its
derivatives are discussed with CNS stimulants (see Chapter 15).
255

--- PAGE 256 ---

B.  Tyramine
Tyramine [TIE-ra-meen] is not a clinically useful drug, but it is important because it is found in fermented foods,
such as aged cheese and Chianti wine. It is a normal by-product of tyrosine metabolism. Normally, it is oxidized by
MAO in the gastrointestinal tract, but if the patient is taking MAOIs, it can precipitate serious vasopressor episodes.
Like amphetamines, tyramine can enter the nerve terminal and displace stored norepinephrine. The released
catecholamine then acts on adrenoceptors.
256
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 257 ---

C.  Cocaine
Cocaine [koe-KANE] is unique among local anesthetics in having the ability to block the sodium–chloride (Na+/Cl
−)–dependent norepinephrine transporter required for cellular uptake of norepinephrine into the adrenergic neuron.
Consequently, norepinephrine accumulates in the synaptic space, resulting in enhanced sympathetic activity and
potentiation of the actions of epinephrine and norepinephrine. Therefore, small doses of the catecholamines produce
greatly magnified effects in an individual taking cocaine. In addition, the duration of action of epinephrine and
norepinephrine is increased. Like amphetamines, it can increase blood pressure by α1 agonist actions and β
stimulatory effects. Cocaine as a drug of abuse is discussed in Chapter 45.

VI.  Mixed-Action Adrenergic Agonists
Ephedrine [eh-FED-rin] and pseudoephedrine [soo-doe-eh-FED-rin] are mixed-action adrenergic agents. They not
only enhance release of stored norepinephrine from nerve endings (Figure 6.8) but also directly stimulate both α and
β receptors. Thus, a wide variety of adrenergic actions ensue that are similar to those of epinephrine, although less
potent. Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are not catecholamines and are poor substrates for COMT and MAO.
Therefore, these drugs have a long duration of action. Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine have excellent absorption
after oral administration and penetrate the CNS, but pseudoephedrine has fewer CNS effects. Ephedrine is
eliminated largely unchanged in urine, and pseudoephedrine undergoes incomplete hepatic metabolism before
elimination in urine. Ephedrine raises systolic and diastolic blood pressures by vasoconstriction and cardiac
stimulation and it is indicated in anesthesia-induced hypotension. Ephedrine produces bronchodilation, but it is less
potent and slower acting than epinephrine or isoproterenol . It was previously used to prevent asthma attacks but has
been replaced by more effective medications. Ephedrine produces a mild stimulation of the CNS. This increases
alertness, decreases fatigue, and prevents sleep. It also improves athletic performance. [Note: The clinical use of
ephedrine is declining because of the availability of better, more potent agents that cause fewer adverse effects.
Ephedrine-containing herbal supplements (mainly ephedra-containing products) have been banned by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration because of life-threatening cardiovascular reactions.] Oral pseudoephedrine is primarily
used to treat nasal and sinus congestion. Pseudoephedrine has been illegally used to produce methamphetamine.
Therefore, products containing pseudoephedrine have certain restrictions and must be kept behind the sales counter
in the United States. Important characteristics of the adrenergic agonists are summarized in Figures 6.15 to 6.17.

6.6Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
Which of the following is correct regarding adrenergic neurotransmission?
A.  Norepinephrine is the major neurotransmitter released from sympathetic nerve terminals.
B.  Norepinephrine is mainly released from the adrenal glands.
C.  Tricyclic antidepressants and cocaine prevent the release of norepinephrine from the nerve terminals.
D.  Monoamine oxidase (MAO) converts dopamine to norepinephrine in the nerve terminal.
Correct answer = A. Norepinephrine (NE) is the major neurotransmitter released from sympathetic nerve
terminals. Epinephrine, not norepinephrine, is mainly released from the adrenal glands. Tricyclic antidepressants
(TCAs) and cocaine inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine into the sympathetic nerve terminals, but they do not
prevent the release of NE. Dopamine is converted to norepinephrine by dopamine β-hydroxylase, not by MAO.
Which of the following adrenergic drugs is used in the treatment of overactive bladder?
A.  Epinephrine
B.  Dobutamine
C.  Phenylephrine
D.  Mirabegron
Correct answer = D. Detrusor muscles in the urinary bladder wall have β3 receptors. Stimulation of these
receptors relaxes the urinary bladder wall and relieves overactive bladder. Mirabegron is a β3 agonist and
therefore used in treating overactive bladder. None of the other drugs listed have β3 agonist activity.
Which of the following classes of adrenergic agents has utility in the management of hypertension?
A.  α1 Agonist
B.  α2 Agonist
C.  β1 Agonist
D.  β3 Agonist
Correct answer = B. α2 Agonists activate α2 receptors located in the presynaptic terminal of sympathetic neurons
and cause a reduction in the release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerve terminals. This leads to a reduction
in blood pressure. α2 Agonists such as clonidine and methyldopa are therefore used as antihypertensive agents. α1
Agonists cause vasoconstriction, and β1 agonists cause increased cardiac output and renin release, so these agents
may increase blood pressure. β3 Agonists are not used in the management of hypertension.
Which of the following is correct regarding responses mediated by adrenergic receptors?
A.  Stimulation of α1 receptors increases blood pressure.
B.  Stimulation of sympathetic presynaptic α2 receptors increases norepinephrine release.
C.  Stimulation of β2 receptors increases heart rate (tachycardia).
D.  Stimulation of β2 receptors causes bronchoconstriction.
Correct answer = A. Stimulation of α1 receptors, mostly found in the blood vessels, causes vasoconstriction and
an increase in blood pressure. Stimulation of α2 receptors on the sympathetic presynaptic terminal reduces the
release of norepinephrine. β2 receptors are not found in the heart, so activation of β2 receptors does not affect
heart rate. Stimulation of β2 receptors found in the bronchial tissues causes bronchodilation, not
bronchoconstriction.
An asthma patient was given a nonselective β agonist to relieve bronchoconstriction. Which adverse effect
would you expect in this patient?
A.  Bradycardia
B.  Tachycardia
C.  Hypotension (reduction in blood pressure)
D.  Worsening bronchoconstriction
Correct answer = B. A nonselective β agonist activates both β1 and β2 receptors. β1 Activation causes an increase
in heart rate (tachycardia), contractility, and subsequent increase in blood pressure. It relieves bronchoconstriction
because of the β2 receptor activation.
A 22-year-old male is brought to the emergency room with suspected cocaine overdose. Which of the
following symptoms is most likely in this patient?
A.  Hypertension
B.  Bronchoconstriction262

6.7
6.8
6.9
6.10C.  Bradycardia
D.  Miosis (constriction of pupil)
Correct answer = A. Cocaine is an indirect adrenergic agonist that prevents the reuptake of norepinephrine into
the nerve terminals, thus increasing the levels of NE in the synaptic cleft. The increase in NE leads to an increase
in blood pressure (hypertension), tachycardia (not bradycardia), mydriasis (not miosis), and other symptoms of
sympathetic overactivity.
A 12-year-old boy with a peanut allergy is brought to the emergency room after accidental consumption of
peanuts. He is in anaphylactic shock. Which of the following drugs is most appropriate to treat this patient?
A.  Norepinephrine
B.  Phenylephrine
C.  Dobutamine
D.  Epinephrine
Correct answer = D. Norepinephrine has more α agonistic effects and activates mainly α1, α2, and β1 receptors.
Epinephrine has more β agonistic effects and activates mainly α1, α2, β1, and β2 receptors. Phenylephrine has
predominantly α effects and activates mainly α1 receptors. Dobutamine mainly activates β1 receptors and has no
significant effects on β2 receptors. Thus, epinephrine is the drug of choice in anaphylactic shock that can both
stimulate the heart (β1 activation) and dilate bronchioles (β2 activation).
An elderly patient is brought to the emergency room with a blood pressure of 76/60 mm Hg, tachycardia, and
low cardiac output. He is diagnosed with acute heart failure. Which of the following drugs is most
appropriate to improve his cardiac function?
A.  Epinephrine
B.  Fenoldopam
C.  Dobutamine
D.  Isoproterenol
Correct answer = C. Among the choices, the ideal drug to increase contractility in acute heart failure is
dobutamine, since it is a selective β1-adrenergic agonist. Fenoldopam is a dopamine agonist used to treat severe
hypertension. The other drugs are nonselective adrenergic agonists that could cause unwanted side effects.
Which of the following adrenergic agonists is commonly present in nasal sprays available over-the-counter
(OTC) to treat nasal congestion?
A.  Clonidine
B.  Albuterol
C.  Oxymetazoline
D.  Formoterol
Correct answer = C. Drugs with selective α1 agonistic activity are commonly used as nasal decongestants because
of their ability to cause vasoconstriction in the nasal vessels. Oxymetazoline is an α1 agonist and therefore the
preferred drug among the choices as a nasal decongestant. Clonidine is an α2 agonist, albuterol is a β2 agonist, and
formoterol is a long-acting β2 agonist.
A patient who has hypertension and mild asthma attacks bought a herbal remedy for asthma online. He does
not take any prescription medications for asthma, but takes a β1-selective blocker for hypertension. The
herbal remedy relieves the asthma attacks, but his blood pressure seems to increase despite the β-blocker
therapy. Which of the following drugs is most likely present in the herbal remedy?
A.  Phenylephrine
B.  Norepinephrine
C.  Ephedrine
D.  Salmeterol
Correct answer = C. Both ephedrine and salmeterol can relieve asthma symptoms, as they activate β2 receptors in
the bronchioles and cause bronchodilation. However, salmeterol is a selective β2 agonist and should not increase
blood pressure. By contrast, ephedrine stimulates the release of norepinephrine and acts as a direct agonist at α-
and β-adrenergic receptors, thus causing an increase in blood pressure. Phenylephrine (a nonselective α agonist)
does not cause bronchodilation, so it would not relieve asthma symptoms. Norepinephrine is a nonselective
adrenergic agonist that does not have any stimulatory effects on β2 receptors. In addition, norepinephrine is not
active when given orally.263

Adrenergic Antagonists

--- PAGE 266 ---

I.  Overview
The adrenergic antagonists (also called adrenergic blockers or sympatholytics) bind to adrenoceptors but do not
trigger the usual receptor-mediated intracellular effects. These drugs act by either reversibly or irreversibly attaching
to the adrenoceptors, thus preventing activation by endogenous or exogenous agonists. Like the agonists, the
adrenergic antagonists are classified according to their relative affinities for α or β receptors in the sympathetic
nervous system. Numerous adrenergic antagonists have important roles in clinical medicine, primarily to treat
diseases associated with the cardiovascular system. [Note: Antagonists that block dopamine receptors are most
important in the central nervous system (CNS) and are, therefore, considered in that section.] The adrenergic
antagonists discussed in this chapter are summarized in Figure 7.1.

II.  α-Adrenergic Blocking Agents
α-Adrenergic blocking agents antagonize the subtype(s) of α-adrenergic receptors (α1 or α2), depending on the
specificity of the agent for the receptor subtype(s). Drugs that block α1-adrenoceptors profoundly affect blood
pressure. Because normal sympathetic control of the vasculature occurs in large part through agonist actions on α1-
adrenergic receptors, blockade of these receptors reduces the sympathetic tone of the blood vessels, resulting in
decreased peripheral vascular resistance. This lowered blood pressure induces reflex tachycardia. The magnitude of
the response depends on the sympathetic tone of the individual when the agent is given. Selective α2-adrenergic
blockers have limited clinical utility.
269

--- PAGE 270 ---

A.  Phenoxybenzamine
Phenoxybenzamine [fen-ox-ee-BEN-za-meen] is a nonselective, noncompetitive blocker of α1- and α2-adrenergic
receptors.
1.  Actions
a.  Cardiovascular effects
The drug prevents α1 receptor vasoconstriction of peripheral blood vessels caused by endogenous catecholamines,
which leads to decreased peripheral resistance and resultant reflex tachycardia. However, by blocking presynaptic α2
receptors on the sympathetic nerve terminals in the heart, phenoxybenzamine causes an increase in the release of
norepinephrine, which in turn increases heart rate and cardiac output (mediated by β1 receptors). This may also lead
to cardiac arrhythmias and anginal pain. Thus, the drug has been unsuccessful in maintaining lowered blood
pressure in hypertension, and it is no longer used for this purpose.
b.  Epinephrine reversal
All α-adrenergic blockers reverse the α agonist actions of epinephrine. For example, the vasoconstrictive action of
epinephrine is interrupted, but vasodilation of other vascular beds caused by stimulation of β2 receptors is not
blocked. Therefore, in the presence of phenoxybenzamine, the systemic blood pressure decreases in response to
epinephrine (Figure 7.2). [Note: The actions of norepinephrine are not reversed but are diminished because
norepinephrine lacks significant β agonist action on the vasculature.] Phenoxybenzamine has no effect on the actions
of isoproterenol , which is a pure β agonist (Figure 7.2).

induced by isoproterenol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine.

--- PAGE 271 ---

2.  Therapeutic uses
Phenoxybenzamine is used in the treatment of sweating and hypertension associated with pheochromocytoma, a
catecholamine-secreting tumor of cells derived from the adrenal medulla. Phenoxybenzamine is sometimes effective
in treating Raynaud disease and frostbite.
3.  Adverse effects
Phenoxybenzamine can cause postural hypotension, nasal stuffiness, nausea, and vomiting. It may inhibit
ejaculation. It may also induce reflex tachycardia, which is mediated by the baroreceptor reflex. Phenoxybenzamine
should be used with caution in patients with cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease.
271

--- PAGE 272 ---

B.  Phentolamine
In contrast to phenoxybenzamine, phentolamine [fen-TOLE-a-meen] produces a competitive block of α1 and α2
receptors. Effects last for approximately 4 hours after a single injection. Pharmacological effects of phentolamine
are very similar to those of phenoxybenzamine. It is used for the diagnosis and short-term management of
pheochromocytoma. It is also used locally to prevent dermal necrosis following extravasation of norepinephrine.
Phentolamine is useful to treat hypertensive crisis due to abrupt withdrawal of clonidine or ingestion of tyramine-
containing foods in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors.
272
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 273 ---

C.  Prazosin, terazosin, and doxazosin
Prazosin [PRAY-zoe-sin], terazosin [ter-AY-zoe-sin], and doxazosin [dox-AY-zoe-sin] are selective competitive
blockers of the α1 receptor. In contrast to phenoxybenzamine and phentolamine, they are useful in the treatment of
hypertension. [Note: Tamsulosin [tam-SUE-loh-sin], alfuzosin [al-FYOO-zoe-sin], and silodosin [sye-LOE-doe-sin]
are examples of other selective α1 antagonists indicated for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (see
Chapter 41).] Metabolism leads to inactive products that are excreted in urine except for those of doxazosin, which
appear in feces. Doxazosin is the longest acting of these drugs.
1.  Mechanism of action
These agents decrease peripheral vascular resistance and lower blood pressure by causing relaxation of both arterial
and venous smooth muscle. Unlike phenoxybenzamine and phentolamine, these drugs cause minimal changes in
cardiac output, renal blood flow, and glomerular filtration rate. Tamsulosin, alfuzosin, and silodosin have less
pronounced effects on blood pressure because they are less selective for α1B receptors found in the blood vessels and
more selective for α1A receptors in the prostate and bladder. Blockade of the α1A receptors decreases tone in the
smooth muscle of the bladder neck and prostate and improves urine flow.
2.  Therapeutic uses
Individuals with elevated blood pressure treated with one of these drugs do not become tolerant to its action.
However, the first dose of these drugs may produce an exaggerated orthostatic hypotensive response (Figure 7.3)
that can result in syncope (fainting). This action, termed a “first-dose” effect, may be minimized by adjusting the
first dose to one-third or one-fourth of the normal dose and by giving the drug at bedtime. These drugs may cause
modest improvement in lipid profiles and glucose metabolism in hypertensive patients. Because of inferior
cardiovascular outcomes as compared to other antihypertensives, α1 antagonists are not used as monotherapy for the
treatment of hypertension (see Chapter 16).
Figure 7.3 First dose of α1 receptor blocker may produce an orthostatic hypotensive
response that can result in syncope (fainting).
3.  Adverse effects
α1-Blockers such as prazosin and doxazosin may cause dizziness, a lack of energy, nasal congestion, headache,
drowsiness, and orthostatic hypotension (although to a lesser degree than that observed with phenoxybenzamine and
phentolamine). An additive antihypertensive effect occurs when α1 antagonists are given with vasodilators such as
nitrates or PDE-5 inhibitors (for example, sildenafil ), thereby necessitating cautious dose titration and use at the
lowest possible doses. These agents may cause “floppy iris syndrome,” a condition in which the iris billows in
response to intraoperative eye surgery. Figure 7.4 summarizes some adverse effects observed with α-blockers.

D.  Yohimbine
Yohimbine [yo-HIM-bean] is a selective competitive α2-blocker that works at the level of the CNS to increase
sympathetic outflow to the periphery. It is found as a component of the bark of the yohimbe tree (Pausinystalia
yohimbe) and has been used as a sexual stimulant and in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Its use in the
treatment of these disorders is not recommended due to lack of demonstrated efficacy.

--- PAGE 276 ---

III.  β-Adrenergic Blocking Agents
All of the clinically available β-blockers are competitive antagonists. Nonselective β-blockers act at both β1 and β2
receptors, whereas cardioselective β antagonists primarily block β1 receptors. [Note: There are no clinically useful
β2 selective antagonists.] These drugs also differ in intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), CNS effects, blockade
of sympathetic receptors, vasodilation, and pharmacokinetics (Figure 7.5). Although all β-blockers lower blood
pressure, they do not induce postural hypotension, because the α-adrenoceptors remain functional. Therefore, normal
sympathetic control of the vasculature is maintained. β-Blockers are effective in treating systemic as well as portal
hypertension, angina, cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, heart failure, hyperthyroidism, and glaucoma.
They are also used for the prophylaxis of migraine headaches. [Note: The names of all β-blockers end in “-olol”
except for labetalol  and carvedilol .]

--- PAGE 277 ---

A.  Propranolol: a nonselective β antagonist
Propranolol  [proe-PRAN-oh-lole] is the prototype β-adrenergic antagonist and blocks both β1 and β2 receptors with
equal affinity. Sustained-release preparations for once-a-day dosing are available. Nonselective β-blockers,
including propranolol , have the ability to block the actions of isoproterenol  (β1, β2 agonist) on the cardiovascular
system. Thus, in the presence of a β-blocker, isoproterenol  does not produce cardiac stimulation (β1 mediated) or
reductions in mean arterial pressure and diastolic pressure (β2 mediated; Figure 7.2). [Note: In the presence of a
nonselective β-blocker, epinephrine no longer lowers diastolic blood pressure or stimulates the heart, but its
vasoconstrictive action (mediated by α receptors) remains unimpaired. The actions of norepinephrine on the
cardiovascular system are mediated primarily by α receptors and are, therefore, mostly unaffected.]
1.  Actions
a.  Cardiovascular
Propranolol  diminishes cardiac output, having both negative inotropic and chronotropic effects ( Figure 7.6). It
directly depresses sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodal activity. The resulting bradycardia usually limits the dose of
the drug. During exercise or stress, when the sympathetic nervous system is activated, β-blockers attenuate the
expected increase in heart rate. Cardiac output, workload, and oxygen consumption are decreased by blockade of β1
receptors, and these effects are useful in the treatment of angina (see Chapter 20). The β-blockers are effective in
attenuating supraventricular cardiac arrhythmias, but generally are not effective against ventricular arrhythmias
(except those induced by exercise).

Figure 7.6 Actions of propranolol and other β-blockers.
b.  Peripheral vasoconstriction
Nonselective blockade of β receptors prevents β2-mediated vasodilation in skeletal muscles, increasing peripheral
vascular resistance (Figure 7.6). The reduction in cardiac output produced by all β-blockers leads to decreased blood
pressure, which triggers a reflex peripheral vasoconstriction that is reflected in reduced blood flow to the periphery.
In patients with hypertension, total peripheral resistance returns to normal or decreases with long-term use of
propranolol  as a result of down regulation of the β receptors. There is a gradual reduction of both systolic and
diastolic blood pressures in hypertensive patients.
c.  Bronchoconstriction
Blocking β2 receptors in the lungs of susceptible patients causes contraction of the bronchiolar smooth muscle
(Figure 7.6). This can precipitate an exacerbation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or
asthma. Therefore, β-blockers, particularly nonselective ones, are contraindicated in patients with asthma and should
be avoided in COPD.
d.  Disturbances in glucose metabolism
β-Blockade leads to decreased glycogenolysis and decreased glucagon secretion. Therefore, if propranolol  is given
to a diabetic patient receiving insulin, careful monitoring of blood glucose is essential, because pronounced
hypoglycemia may occur after insulin injection. β-Blockers also attenuate the normal physiologic response to
hypoglycemia. [Note: Diaphoresis with hypoglycemia still occurs, as this is mediated through the neurotransmitter
acetylcholine.]
2.  Therapeutic uses
a.  Hypertension
Propranolol  does not reduce blood pressure in people with normal blood pressure. Propranolol  lowers blood
pressure in hypertension by several different mechanisms of action. Decreased cardiac output is the primary
mechanism, but inhibition of renin release from the kidney, decrease in total peripheral resistance with long-term
use, and decreased sympathetic outflow from the CNS also contribute to the antihypertensive effects (see Chapter
16).
b.  Angina pectoris
Propranolol  decreases the oxygen requirement of heart muscle and, therefore, is effective in reducing chest pain on
exertion that is common in angina. Propranolol  is therefore useful in the management of chronic stable angina.
c.  Myocardial infarction
Propranolol  and other β-blockers have a protective effect on the myocardium. Thus, patients who have had one
myocardial infarction seem to be protected against a second heart attack by prophylactic use of β-blockers. In
addition, administration of a β-blocker immediately following a myocardial infarction reduces infarct size and early
mortality. The mechanism for these effects may be a reduction in the actions of circulating catecholamines that
increase the oxygen demand in an already ischemic heart muscle. Propranolol  also reduces the incidence of sudden
arrhythmic death after myocardial infarction.
d.  Migraine
Propranolol  is effective in reducing migraine episodes when used prophylactically (see Chapter 37). It is one of the
more useful β-blockers for this indication, due to its lipophilic nature that allows it to penetrate the CNS. [Note: For
the acute management of migraine, serotonin agonists such as sumatriptan are used, as well as other drugs.]
e.  Hyperthyroidism
Propranolol  and other β-blockers are effective in blunting the widespread sympathetic stimulation that occurs in
hyperthyroidism. In acute hyperthyroidism (thyroid storm), β-blockers may be lifesaving in protecting against
serious cardiac arrhythmias.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
After oral administration, propranolol  is almost completely absorbed. It is subject to first-pass effect, and only about
25% of an administered dose reaches the circulation. The volume of distribution of propranolol  is quite large (4
L/kg), and the drug readily crosses the blood–brain barrier due to its high lipophilicity. Propranolol  is extensively
metabolized, and most metabolites are excreted in the urine.
4.  Adverse effects
a.  Bronchoconstriction
Propranolol  has the potential to cause significant bronchoconstriction due to blockade of β2 receptors (Figure 7.7).
Death by asphyxiation has been reported for patients with asthma who inadvertently received the drug. Therefore,
propranolol  is contraindicated in patients with COPD or asthma.279

Figure 7.7 Adverse effects commonly observed in individuals treated with propranolol.
b.  Arrhythmias
Treatment with β-blockers must never be stopped abruptly because of the risk of precipitating cardiac arrhythmias,
which may be severe. The β-blockers must be tapered off gradually over a period of at least a few weeks. Long-term
treatment with a β antagonist leads to up-regulation of the β receptor. On suspension of therapy, the increased
receptors can precipitate worsened angina or hypertension through action of endogenous catecholamines on the up-
regulated β receptors.
c.  Sexual impairment
Impaired sexual activity has been reported in male patients taking propranolol . The reasons for this are not clear and
may be independent of β receptor blockade. However, β-blockers do not affect ejaculation (mediated by α
receptors).
d.  Metabolic disturbances 280
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 281 ---

β-Blockade leads to decreased glycogenolysis and decreased glucagon secretion. Fasting hypoglycemia may occur.
In addition, β-blockers can prevent the counterregulatory effects of catecholamines during hypoglycemia. Thus, the
perception of symptoms of hypoglycemia such as tremor, tachycardia, and nervousness are blunted by β-blockers. A
major role of β receptors is to mobilize energy molecules such as free fatty acids. [Note: Lipases in fat cells are
activated mainly by β receptor stimulation, leading to the metabolism of triglycerides into free fatty acids.] Patients
administered nonselective β-blockers may have increased triglycerides and reduced high-density lipoprotein (“good”
cholesterol) through β-blockade. These effects on the serum lipid profile may be less pronounced with the use of β1-
selective antagonists such as metoprolol .
e.  CNS effects
Propranolol  has numerous CNS-mediated effects, including depression, dizziness, lethargy, fatigue, weakness,
visual disturbances, hallucinations, short-term memory loss, emotional lability, vivid dreams (including nightmares),
and depression. Fewer CNS effects may be seen with more hydrophilic β-blockers (for example, atenolol ) because
they do not cross the blood–brain barrier as readily.
f.  Drug interactions
Drugs that interfere with, or inhibit, the metabolism of propranolol , such as cimetidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and
ritonavir, may potentiate its antihypertensive effects. Conversely, those that stimulate or induce its metabolism, such
as barbiturates, phenytoin, and rifampin, can decrease its effects. Nonselective β-blockers such as propranolol  may
prevent the rescue effects of epinephrine in anaphylaxis.

B.  Nadolol and timolol: nonselective β antagonists
Nadolol  [NAH-doh-lole] and timolol  [TIM-o-lole] also block β1- and β2-adrenoceptors and are more potent than
propranolol . Nadolol  has a very long duration of action (Figure 7.5). Timolol  reduces the production of aqueous
humor in the eye. It is used topically in the treatment of chronic open-angle glaucoma.
1.  Treatment of glaucoma
β-Blockers, such as topically applied timolol , are effective in diminishing intraocular pressure in glaucoma (Figure
7.8). This occurs by decreasing the secretion of aqueous humor by the ciliary body. Carteolol  [kar-TEE-oh-lol],
levobunolol  [lee-voe-BYOO-noe-lole], and metipranolol  [met-i-PRAN-oh-lol] are nonselective β antagonists,
whereas betaxolol  [be-TAKS-oh-lol] is a β1-selective agent. Unlike the cholinergic drugs, these agents neither affect
the ability of the eye to focus for near vision nor change pupil size. When administered intraocularly, the onset is
about 30 minutes, and the effects last for 12 to 24 hours. The β-blockers are only used for chronic management of
glaucoma. In an acute attack of glaucoma, pilocarpine is still the drug of choice for emergency lowering of
intraocular pressure. Other agents used in the treatment of glaucoma are summarized in Figure 7.8.

--- PAGE 283 ---

C.  Acebutolol, atenolol, betaxolol, bisoprolol, esmolol, metoprolol,
and nebivolol: selective β 1 antagonists
Drugs that preferentially block the β1 receptors minimize the unwanted bronchoconstriction (β2 effect) seen with use
of nonselective agents in asthma patients. Cardioselective β-blockers, such as acebutolol  [a-se-BYOO-toe-lole],
atenolol  [a-TEN-oh-lole], and metoprolol  [me-TOE-proe-lole], antagonize β1 receptors at doses 50- to 100-fold less
than those required to block β2 receptors. This cardioselectivity is most pronounced at low doses and is lost at high
doses. [Note: Because β1 selectivity of these agents is lost at high doses, they may antagonize β2 receptors.]
1.  Actions
These drugs lower blood pressure in hypertension and increase exercise tolerance in angina (Figure 7.6). Esmolol
[EZ-moe-lole] has a very short half-life (Figure 7.5) due to metabolism of an ester linkage. It is only available
intravenously and is used to control blood pressure or heart rhythm in critically ill patients and those undergoing
surgery or diagnostic procedures. In addition to its cardioselective β-blockade, nebivolol  [ne-BIV-oh-lole] releases
nitric oxide from endothelial cells and causes vasodilation. In contrast to propranolol , the cardioselective β-blockers
have fewer effects on pulmonary function, peripheral resistance, and carbohydrate metabolism. Nevertheless, asthma
patients treated with these agents must be carefully monitored to make certain that respiratory activity is not
compromised. Because these drugs have less effect on peripheral vascular β2 receptors, coldness of extremities
(Raynaud phenomenon), a common side effect of β-blockers, is less frequent.
2.  Therapeutic uses
The cardioselective β-blockers are useful in hypertensive patients with impaired pulmonary function. These agents
are also first-line therapy for chronic stable angina. Bisoprolol  and the extended-release formulation of metoprolol
are indicated for the management of chronic heart failure.

--- PAGE 284 ---

D.  Acebutolol and pindolol: antagonists with partial agonist
activity
1.  Actions
a.  Cardiovascular
Acebutolol  (β1-selective antagonist) and pindolol  (nonselective β-blocker) [PIN-doe-lole] are not pure antagonists.
These drugs can also weakly stimulate both β1 and β2 receptors (Figure 7.9) and are said to have ISA. These partial
agonists stimulate the β receptor to which they are bound, yet they inhibit stimulation by the more potent
endogenous catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine. The result of these opposing actions is a diminished
effect on reduction of cardiac rate and cardiac output compared to that of β-blockers without ISA.

Figure 7.9 Comparison of agonists, antagonists, and partial agonists of β-adrenoceptors.
b.  Decreased metabolic effects
β-Blockers with ISA minimize the disturbances of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism that are seen with other β-
blockers. For example, these agents do not decrease plasma HDL levels.
2.  Therapeutic use
β-Blockers with ISA are effective in hypertensive patients with moderate bradycardia, because a further decrease in
heart rate is less pronounced with these drugs. [Note: β-blockers with ISA are not used for stable angina or
arrhythmias due to their partial agonist effect.] Overall, β-blockers with ISA are infrequently used in clinical
practice. Figure 7.10 summarizes some of the indications for β-blockers.

E.  Labetalol and carvedilol: antagonists of both α- and β-
adrenoceptors
1.  Actions
Labetalol  [lah-BET-a-lole] and carvedilol  [CAR-ve-dil-ol] are nonselective β-blockers with concurrent α1-blocking
actions that produce peripheral vasodilation, thereby reducing blood pressure. They contrast with the other β-
blockers that produce initial peripheral vasoconstriction, and these agents are, therefore, useful in treating
hypertensive patients for whom increased peripheral vascular resistance is undesirable. Carvedilol  also decreases
lipid peroxidation and vascular wall thickening, effects that have benefit in heart failure.
2.  Therapeutic use in hypertension and heart failure
Labetalol  is used as an alternative to methyldopa in the treatment of pregnancy-induced hypertension. Intravenous
labetalol  is also used to treat hypertensive emergencies, because it can rapidly lower blood pressure (see Chapter
16). β-Blockers should not be given to patients with an acute exacerbation of heart failure, as they can worsen the
condition. However, carvedilol  as well as metoprolol  and bisoprolol  are beneficial in patients with stable chronic
heart failure. These agents work by blocking the effects of sympathetic stimulation on the heart, which causes
worsening heart failure over time (see Chapter 18).
3.  Adverse effects
Orthostatic hypotension and dizziness are associated with α1-blockade. Figure 7.11 summarizes the receptor
specificities and uses of the β-adrenergic antagonists.

pindolol are partial agonists, as well. 2Bisoprolol, metoprolol, and carvedilol are also

IV.  Drugs Affecting Neurotransmitter Release or Uptake
Some agents act on the adrenergic neuron, either to interfere with neurotransmitter release from storage vesicles or
to alter the uptake of the neurotransmitter into the adrenergic neuron. However, due to the advent of newer and more
effective agents with fewer side effects, these agents are seldom used therapeutically. Reserpine [re-SER-peen] is
one of the remaining agents in this category.
Reserpine, a plant alkaloid, blocks the Mg2+/adenosine triphosphate–dependent transport of biogenic amines
(norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin) from the cytoplasm into storage vesicles in the adrenergic nerve
terminals in all body tissues. This causes the ultimate depletion of biogenic amines. Sympathetic function, in
general, is impaired because of decreased release of norepinephrine. Reserpine has a slow onset, a long duration of
action, and effects that persist for many days after discontinuation. It has been used for the management of
hypertension but has largely been replaced with newer agents with better side effect profiles and fewer drug
interactions. It is also indicated in agitated psychotic states such as schizophrenia to relieve symptoms.

7.5Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
A 60-year-old patient started a new antihypertensive medication. His blood pressure is well controlled, but
he complains of fatigue, drowsiness, and fainting when he gets up from the bed (orthostatic hypotension).
Which of the following drugs is he most likely taking?
A.  Metoprolol
B.  Propranolol
C.  Prazosin
D.  Alfuzosin
Correct answer = C. Because they block α1-mediated vasoconstriction, α-blockers (prazosin) are more likely to
cause orthostatic hypotension, as compared to β-blockers (metoprolol, propranolol). Alfuzosin is a more selective
antagonist for α1A receptors in the prostate and bladder and is less likely to cause hypotension than prazosin.
A 30-year-old male patient was brought to the ER with amphetamine overdose. He presented with high
blood pressure and arrhythmias. Which drug is the most appropriate to treat the cardiovascular symptoms of
amphetamine overdose in this patient?
A.  Metoprolol
B.  Prazosin
C.  Labetalol
D.  Nebivolol
Correct answer = C. Amphetamine is an indirect adrenergic agonist that mainly enhances the release of
norepinephrine from peripheral sympathetic neurons. Therefore, it activates all types of adrenergic receptors (that
is, α and β receptors) and causes an increase in blood pressure. Since both α and β receptors are activated
indirectly by amphetamine, α-blockers (prazosin) or β-blockers (metoprolol, nebivolol) alone cannot relieve the
cardiovascular effects of amphetamine poisoning. Labetalol blocks both α1 and beta receptors and can minimize
the cardiovascular effects of amphetamine overdose.
A new antihypertensive drug was tested in an animal model of hypertension. The drug when given alone
reduces blood pressure in the animal. Norepinephrine when given in the presence of this drug did not cause
any significant change in blood pressure or heart rate in the animal. The mechanism of action of the new
drug is similar to which of the following agents?
A.  Doxazosin
B.  Clonidine
C.  Atenolol
D.  Carvedilol
Correct answer = D. Norepinephrine activates both α1 and β1 receptors and causes an increase in heart rate and
blood pressure. A drug that prevents the increase in blood pressure caused by norepinephrine should be similar to
carvedilol that antagonizes both α1 and β1 receptors. Doxazosin is an α1 antagonist, clonidine is an α2 agonist, and
atenolol is a β antagonist, and these drugs cannot completely prevent the cardiovascular effects of norepinephrine.
A β-blocker was prescribed for hypertension in a patient with asthma. After a week of treatment, the asthma
attacks got worse, and the patient was asked to stop taking the β-blocker. Which β-blocker would you
suggest as an alternative that is less likely to worsen the asthma?
A.  Propranolol
B.  Metoprolol
C.  Labetalol
D.  Carvedilol
Correct answer = B. The patient was most likely given a nonselective β-blocker (antagonizes both β1 and β2
receptors) that made the asthma worse due to β2 antagonism. An alternative is to prescribe a cardioselective
(antagonizes only β1) β-blocker that does not antagonize β2 receptors in the bronchioles. Metoprolol is a
cardioselective β-blocker. Propranolol, labetalol, and carvedilol are nonselective β-blockers and could worsen the
asthma.
A 70-year-old male is treated with doxazosin for overflow incontinence due to his enlarged prostate. He
complains of dizzy spells while getting up from bed at night. Which drug would you suggest as an alternative
that may not cause dizziness?
A.  Propranolol
B.  Phentolamine
C.  Tamsulosin
D.  Terazosin291
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 292 ---

7.6
7.7
7.8
7.9
7.10Correct answer = C. Dizziness in this elderly patient could be due to orthostatic hypotension caused by doxazosin.
Tamsulosin is an α1 antagonist that is more selective to the α1 receptor subtype (α1A) present in the prostate and
less selective to the α1 receptor subtype (α1B) present in the blood vessels. Therefore, tamsulosin should not affect
blood pressure significantly and may not cause dizziness. Terazosin and phentolamine antagonize both these
subtypes and cause significant hypotension as a side effect. Propranolol is a nonselective beta-blocker that is not
indicated in overflow incontinence.
A 50-year-old male was in anaphylactic shock after being stung by a hornet. The medical team tried to
reverse the bronchoconstriction and hypotension using epinephrine; however, the patient did not fully
respond to the treatment. The patient’s wife mentioned that he is taking a prescription medication for blood
pressure. Which medication is he most likely taking that contributed to a reduced response to epinephrine?
A.  Doxazosin
B.  Propranolol
C.  Metoprolol
D.  Acebutolol
Correct answer = B. Epinephrine reverses hypotension by activating β1 receptors and relieves bronchoconstriction
by activating β2 receptors in anaphylaxis. Since epinephrine was not effective in reversing hypotension or
bronchoconstriction in this patient, it could be assumed that the patient was on a nonselective β-blocker
(propranolol). Doxazosin (α1-blocker), metoprolol, or acebutolol (both β1-selective blockers) would not have
completely prevented the effects of epinephrine.
Which of the following is correct regarding α-adrenergic blockers?
A.  α-Adrenergic blockers are used in the treatment of hypotension in anaphylactic shock.
B.  α-Adrenergic blockers are used in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).
C.  α-Adrenergic blockers may cause bradycardia.
D.  α-Adrenergic blockers reduce the frequency of urination.
Correct answer = B. α-Adrenergic blockers are used in the treatment of BPH because of their relaxant effect on
prostate smooth muscles. Being antihypertensive agents, they are not useful in treating hypotension in
anaphylaxis. α-Adrenergic blockers generally cause reflex tachycardia (not bradycardia) due to the significant
drop in blood pressure caused by them. They increase (not reduce) the frequency of urination by relaxing the
internal sphincter of the urinary bladder, which is controlled by α1 receptors.
Which of the following is correct regarding β-blockers?
A.  Treatment with β-blockers should not be stopped abruptly.
B.  Propranolol is a cardioselective β-blocker.
C.  Cardioselective β-blockers worsen asthma.
D.  β-Blockers decrease peripheral resistance by causing vasorelaxation.
Correct answer = A. If β-blocker therapy is stopped abruptly, that could cause angina and rebound hypertension.
This could be due to the up-regulation of β receptors in the body. β-Blockers do not cause direct vasorelaxation.
Therefore, they do not decrease peripheral resistance with short-term use. Propranolol is a nonselective β-blocker
(not cardioselective). Cardioselective β-blockers antagonize only β1 receptors and do not worsen asthma, as they
do not antagonize β2 receptors.
Which of the following drugs is commonly used topically in the treatment of glaucoma?
A.  Esmolol
B.  Timolol
C.  Silodosin
D.  Yohimbine
Correct answer = B. β-Blockers reduce the formation of aqueous humor in the eye and therefore reduce
intraocular pressure, thus relieving glaucoma. Timolol is a nonselective β-blocker that is commonly used topically
to treat glaucoma. Esmolol is a short-acting β-blocker that is used intravenously for hypertension or arrhythmias.
Silodosin is an α1 antagonist used for BPH, and yohimbine is a α2 antagonist used for sexual dysfunction.
Which of the following drugs has the highest potential to worsen orthostatic hypotension when given
together with prazosin?
A.  Propranolol
B.  Atenolol
C.  Nebivolol
D.  Labetalol
Correct answer = D. Labetalol is a nonselective β-blocker with α1-blocking activity. Prazosin causes orthostatic
hypotension due to its α1-blockade, which could be enhanced by adding labetalol. Propranolol, atenolol and292

I.  Overview
Most drugs that affect the central nervous system (CNS) act by altering some step in the neurotransmission process.
Drugs affecting the CNS may act presynaptically by influencing the production, storage, release, or termination of
action of neurotransmitters. Other agents may activate or block postsynaptic receptors. This chapter provides an
overview of the CNS, with a focus on those neurotransmitters that are involved in the actions of the clinically useful
CNS drugs. These concepts are useful in understanding the etiology and treatment strategies for the
neurodegenerative disorders that respond to drug therapy: Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, multiple sclerosis
(MS), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Figure 8.1).

II.  Neurotransmission in the CNS
The basic functioning of neurons in the CNS is similar to that of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) described in
Chapter 3. For example, transmission of information in both the CNS and in the periphery involves the release of
neurotransmitters that diffuse across the synaptic cleft to bind to specific receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. In
both systems, the recognition of the neurotransmitter by the membrane receptor of the postsynaptic neuron triggers
intracellular changes. However, several major differences exist between neurons in the peripheral ANS and those in
the CNS. The circuitry of the CNS is more complex than that of the ANS, and the number of synapses in the CNS is
far greater. The CNS, unlike the peripheral ANS, contains networks of inhibitory neurons that are constantly active
in modulating the rate of neuronal transmission. In addition, the CNS communicates through the use of multiple
neurotransmitters, whereas the ANS uses only two primary neurotransmitters, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine.
298
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 299 ---

III.  Synaptic Potentials
In the CNS, receptors in most synapses are coupled to ion channels. Binding of the neurotransmitter to the
postsynaptic membrane receptors results in a rapid but transient opening of ion channels. Open channels allow
specific ions inside and outside the cell membrane to flow down their concentration gradients. The resulting change
in the ionic composition across the membrane of the neuron alters the postsynaptic potential, producing either
depolarization or hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic membrane, depending on the specific ions and the direction
of their movement.
299
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 300 ---

A.  Excitatory pathways
Neurotransmitters can be classified as either excitatory or inhibitory, depending on the nature of the action they
elicit. Stimulation of excitatory neurons causes a movement of ions that results in a depolarization of the
postsynaptic membrane. These excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) are generated by the following: 1)
Stimulation of an excitatory neuron causes the release of neurotransmitters, such as glutamate or acetylcholine,
which bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell membrane. This causes a transient increase in the permeability of
sodium (Na+) ions. 2) The influx of Na+ causes a weak depolarization, or EPSP, that moves the postsynaptic
potential toward its firing threshold. 3) If the number of stimulated excitatory neurons increases, more excitatory
neurotransmitter is released. This ultimately causes the EPSP depolarization of the postsynaptic cell to pass a
threshold, thereby generating an all-or-none action potential. [Note: The generation of a nerve impulse typically
reflects the activation of synaptic receptors by thousands of excitatory neurotransmitter molecules released from
many nerve fibers.] Figure 8.2 shows an example of an excitatory pathway.

depolarization of the neuron.

www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 302 ---

B.  Inhibitory pathways
Stimulation of inhibitory neurons causes movement of ions that results in a hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic
membrane. These inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSP) are generated by the following: 1) Stimulation of
inhibitory neurons releases neurotransmitters, such as γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or glycine, which bind to
receptors on the postsynaptic cell membrane. This causes a transient increase in the permeability of specific ions,
such as potassium (K+) and chloride (Cl−). 2) The influx of Cl− and efflux of K+ cause a weak hyperpolarization, or
IPSP, that moves the postsynaptic potential away from its firing threshold. This diminishes the generation of action
potentials. Figure 8.3 shows an example of an inhibitory pathway.

--- PAGE 305 ---

C.  Combined effects of the EPSP and IPSP
Most neurons in the CNS receive both EPSP and IPSP input. Thus, several different types of neurotransmitters may
act on the same neuron, but each binds to its own specific receptor. The overall action is the summation of the
individual actions of the various neurotransmitters on the neuron. The neurotransmitters are not uniformly
distributed in the CNS but are localized in specific clusters of neurons, the axons of which may synapse with
specific regions of the brain. Many neuronal tracts, thus, seem to be chemically coded, and this may offer greater
opportunity for selective pharmacological modulation of certain neuronal pathways.

IV.  Neurodegenerative Diseases
Neurodegenerative diseases of the CNS include Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, MS, and ALS. These
devastating illnesses are characterized by the progressive loss of selected neurons in discrete brain areas, resulting in
characteristic disorders of movement, cognition, or both.

V.  Overview of Parkinson Disease
Parkinsonism is a progressive neurological disorder of muscle movement, characterized by tremors, muscular
rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural and gait abnormalities. Most cases involve people over the age of 65, among
whom the incidence is about 1 in 100 individuals.
307
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 308 ---

A.  Etiology
The cause of Parkinson disease is unknown for most patients. The disease is correlated with destruction of
dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra with a consequent reduction of dopamine actions in the corpus
striatum, parts of the basal ganglia system that are involved in motor control.
1.  Substantia nigra
The substantia nigra, part of the extrapyramidal system, is the source of dopaminergic neurons (shown in red in
Figure 8.4) that terminate in the neostriatum. Each dopaminergic neuron makes thousands of synaptic contacts
within the neostriatum and therefore modulates the activity of a large number of cells. These dopaminergic
projections from the substantia nigra fire tonically rather than in response to specific muscular movements or
sensory input. Thus, the dopaminergic system appears to serve as a tonic, sustaining influence on motor activity,
rather than participating in specific movements.
Figure 8.4 Role of substantia nigra in Parkinson disease. ACh = acetylcholine; DA =
dopamine; GABA = γ-aminobutyric acid.
2.  Neostriatum
Normally, the neostriatum is connected to the substantia nigra by neurons (shown in orange in Figure 8.4) that
secrete the inhibitory transmitter GABA at their termini. In turn, cells of the substantia nigra send neurons back to
the neostriatum, secreting the inhibitory transmitter dopamine at their termini. This mutual inhibitory pathway
normally maintains a degree of inhibition of both areas. In Parkinson disease, destruction of cells in the substantia
nigra results in the degeneration of the nerve terminals that secrete dopamine in the neostriatum. Thus, the normal
inhibitory influence of dopamine on cholinergic neurons in the neostriatum is significantly diminished, resulting in
overproduction, or a relative overactivity, of acetylcholine by the stimulatory neurons (shown in green in Figure308
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 309 ---

8.4). This triggers a chain of abnormal signaling, resulting in loss of the control of muscle movements.
3.  Secondary parkinsonism
Drugs such as the phenothiazines and haloperidol , whose major pharmacologic action is blockade of dopamine
receptors in the brain, may produce parkinsonian symptoms (also called pseudoparkinsonism). These drugs should
be used with caution in patients with Parkinson disease.
309
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 310 ---

B.  Strategy of treatment
In addition to an abundance of inhibitory dopaminergic neurons, the neostriatum is also rich in excitatory
cholinergic neurons that oppose the action of dopamine (Figure 8.4). Many of the symptoms of parkinsonism reflect
an imbalance between the excitatory cholinergic neurons and the greatly diminished number of inhibitory
dopaminergic neurons. Therapy is aimed at restoring dopamine in the basal ganglia and antagonizing the excitatory
effect of cholinergic neurons, thus reestablishing the correct dopamine/acetylcholine balance.
310
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 311 ---

VI.  Drugs Used in Parkinson Disease
Many currently available drugs aim to maintain CNS dopamine levels, or signaling, as constant as possible. These
agents offer temporary relief from the symptoms of the disorder, but they do not arrest or reverse the neuronal
degeneration caused by the disease.

A.  Levodopa and carbidopa
Levodopa [lee-voe-DOE-pa] is a metabolic precursor of dopamine (Figure 8.5). It restores dopaminergic
neurotransmission in the neostriatum by enhancing the synthesis of dopamine in the surviving neurons of the
substantia nigra. In early disease, the number of residual dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (typically
about 20% of normal) is adequate for conversion of levodopa to dopamine. Thus, in new patients, the therapeutic
response to levodopa is consistent, and the patient rarely complains that the drug effects “wear off.” Unfortunately,
with time, the number of neurons decreases, and fewer cells are capable of converting exogenously administered
levodopa to dopamine. Consequently, motor control fluctuation develops. Relief provided by levodopa is only
symptomatic, and it lasts only while the drug is present in the body.
Figure 8.5 Synthesis of dopamine from levodopa in the absence and presence of
carbidopa, an inhibitor of dopamine decarboxylase in the peripheral tissues. (GI =
gastrointestinal.)
1.  Mechanism of action
a.  Levodopa
Dopamine does not cross the blood–brain barrier, but its immediate precursor, levodopa, is actively transported into
the CNS and converted to dopamine (Figure 8.5). Levodopa must be administered with carbidopa [kar-bi-DOE-pa].
Without carbidopa, much of the drug is decarboxylated to dopamine in the periphery, resulting in diminished effect,
nausea, vomiting, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypotension.
b.  Carbidopa
Carbidopa, a dopamine decarboxylase inhibitor, diminishes the metabolism of levodopa in the periphery, thereby
increasing the availability of levodopa to the CNS. The addition of carbidopa lowers the dose of levodopa needed
by four- to five-fold and, consequently, decreases the severity of adverse effects arising from peripherally formed
dopamine.
2.  Therapeutic uses
Levodopa in combination with carbidopa is an efficacious drug regimen for the treatment of Parkinson disease. It
decreases rigidity, tremors, and other symptoms of parkinsonism. In approximately two-thirds of patients with
Parkinson disease, levodopa–carbidopa substantially reduces the severity of symptoms for the first few years of
treatment. Patients typically experience a decline in response during the 3rd to 5th year of therapy. Withdrawal from
the drug must be gradual.
3.  Absorption and metabolism
The drug is absorbed rapidly from the small intestine (when empty of food). Levodopa has an extremely short half-
life (1 to 2 hours), which causes fluctuations in plasma concentration. This may produce fluctuations in motor
response, which generally correlate with the plasma concentration of levodopa, or perhaps give rise to the more
troublesome “on–off” phenomenon, in which the motor fluctuations are not related to plasma levels in a simple way.
Motor fluctuations may cause the patient to suddenly lose normal mobility and experience tremors, cramps, and
immobility. Ingestion of meals, particularly if high in protein, interferes with the transport of levodopa into the CNS.
Thus, levodopa should be taken on an empty stomach, typically 30 minutes before a meal.
4.  Adverse effects312

--- PAGE 313 ---

a.  Peripheral effects
Anorexia, nausea, and vomiting occur because of stimulation of the chemoreceptor trigger zone ( Figure 8.6).
Tachycardia and ventricular extrasystole result from dopaminergic action on the heart. Hypotension may also
develop. Adrenergic action on the iris causes mydriasis. In some individuals, blood dyscrasias and a positive
reaction to the Coombs test are seen. Saliva and urine may turn brownish color because of the melanin pigment
produced from catecholamine oxidation.

b.  CNS effects
314
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 315 ---

Visual and auditory hallucinations and abnormal involuntary movements (dyskinesias) may occur. These effects are
the opposite of parkinsonian symptoms and reflect overactivity of dopamine in the basal ganglia. Levodopa can also
cause mood changes, depression, psychosis, and anxiety.
5.  Interactions
The vitamin pyridoxine (B6) increases the peripheral breakdown of levodopa and diminishes its effectiveness
(Figure 8.7). Concomitant administration of levodopa and nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs),
such as phenelzine, can produce a hypertensive crisis caused by enhanced catecholamine production. Therefore,
concomitant administration of these agents is contraindicated. In many psychotic patients, levodopa exacerbates
symptoms, possibly through the buildup of central catecholamines. Cardiac patients should be carefully monitored
for the possible development of arrhythmias. Antipsychotic drugs are generally contraindicated in Parkinson disease,
because they potently block dopamine receptors and may augment parkinsonian symptoms. However, low doses of
atypical antipsychotics, such as quetiapine or clozapine, are sometimes used to treat levodopa-induced psychotic
symptoms.
Figure 8.7 Some drug interactions observed with levodopa. MAO = monoamine oxidase.
315

--- PAGE 316 ---

B.  Selegiline, rasagiline, and safinamide
Selegiline [seh-LEDGE-ah-leen], also called deprenyl  [DE-pre-nill], selectively inhibits monoamine oxidase (MAO)
type B, the enzyme that metabolizes dopamine. It does not inhibit MAO type A (metabolizes norepinephrine and
serotonin) unless given above recommended doses, where it loses its selectivity. By decreasing the metabolism of
dopamine, selegiline increases dopamine levels in the brain (Figure 8.8). When selegiline is administered with
levodopa, it enhances the actions of levodopa and substantially reduces the required dose. Unlike nonselective
MAOIs, selegiline at recommended doses has little potential for causing hypertensive crises. However, the drug
loses selectivity at high doses, and there is a risk for severe hypertension. Selegiline is metabolized to
methamphetamine and amphetamine, whose stimulating properties may produce insomnia if the drug is
administered later than mid-afternoon. Rasagiline [ra-SA-gi-leen], an irreversible and selective inhibitor of brain
MAO type B, has five times the potency of selegiline. Unlike selegiline, rasagiline is not metabolized to an
amphetamine-like substance. Safinamide [sa-FIN-a-mide] is also a selective inhibitor of MAO type B indicated for
use as an adjunct to levodopa–carbidopa.

monoamine oxidase type B.)

--- PAGE 317 ---

C.  Catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors
Normally, the methylation of levodopa by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) to 3-O-methyldopa is a minor
pathway for levodopa metabolism. However, when peripheral dopamine decarboxylase activity is inhibited by
carbidopa, a significant concentration of 3-O-methyldopa is formed that competes with levodopa for active transport
into the CNS (Figure 8.9). Entacapone [en-TAK-a-pone] and tolcapone [TOLE-ka-pone] selectively and reversibly
inhibit COMT. Inhibition of COMT by these agents leads to decreased plasma concentrations of 3-O-methyldopa,
increased central uptake of levodopa, and greater concentrations of brain dopamine. Both of these agents reduce the
symptoms of “wearing-off” phenomena seen in patients on levodopa–carbidopa. The two drugs differ primarily in
their pharmacokinetic and adverse effect profiles.
Figure 8.9 Effect of entacapone on dopa concentration in the central nervous system
(CNS). COMT = catechol-O- methyltransferase.
1.  Pharmacokinetics
Oral absorption of both drugs occurs readily and is not influenced by food. They are extensively bound to plasma
albumin, with a limited volume of distribution. Tolcapone has a relatively long duration of action (probably due to
its affinity for the enzyme) compared to entacapone, which requires more frequent dosing. Both drugs are
extensively metabolized and eliminated in feces and urine. The dosage may need to be adjusted in patients with
moderate or severe cirrhosis.
2.  Adverse effects
Both drugs exhibit adverse effects that are observed in patients taking levodopa–carbidopa, including diarrhea,
postural hypotension, nausea, anorexia, dyskinesias, hallucinations, and sleep disorders. Most seriously, fulminating
hepatic necrosis is associated with tolcapone use. Therefore, it should be used, along with appropriate hepatic
function monitoring, only in patients in whom other modalities have failed. Entacapone does not exhibit this toxicity
and has largely replaced tolcapone in clinical practice.

D.  Dopamine receptor agonists
This group of antiparkinsonian compounds includes bromocriptine [broe-moe-KRIP-teen], an ergot derivative, and
the nonergot drugs, ropinirole [roe-PIN-i-role], pramipexole [pra-mi-PEX-ole], rotigotine [ro-TIG-oh-teen], and
apomorphine [A-poe-more-feen]. These agents have a longer duration of action than that of levodopa and are
effective in patients exhibiting fluctuations in response to levodopa. Initial therapy with these drugs is associated
with less risk of developing dyskinesias and motor fluctuations as compared to patients started on levodopa.
Bromocriptine, pramipexole, and ropinirole are effective in patients with Parkinson disease complicated by motor
fluctuations and dyskinesias. However, these drugs are ineffective in patients who have not responded to levodopa.
Apomorphine is an injectable dopamine agonist that is used in severe and advanced stages of the disease to
supplement oral medications. Adverse effects severely limit the utility of the dopamine agonists (Figure 8.10).

1.  Bromocriptine
319
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 320 ---

The actions of the ergot derivative bromocriptine are similar to those of levodopa, except that hallucinations,
confusion, delirium, nausea, and orthostatic hypotension are more common, whereas dyskinesia is less prominent. In
psychiatric illness, bromocriptine may cause the mental condition to worsen. It should be used with caution in
patients with a history of myocardial infarction or peripheral vascular disease due to the risk of vasospasm. Because
bromocriptine is an ergot derivative, it has the potential to cause pulmonary and retroperitoneal fibrosis.
2.  Apomorphine, pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine
These are nonergot dopamine agonists that are approved for the treatment of Parkinson disease. Ropinirole is also
indicated for the treatment of restless legs syndrome. Pramipexole and ropinirole are orally active agents.
Apomorphine and rotigotine are available in injectable and transdermal delivery systems, respectively. Apomorphine
is used for acute management of the hypomobility “off” phenomenon in advanced Parkinson disease. Rotigotine is
administered as a once-daily transdermal patch that provides even drug levels over 24 hours. These agents alleviate
the motor deficits in patients who have never taken levodopa and also in patients with advanced Parkinson disease
who are treated with levodopa. Dopamine agonists may delay the need to use levodopa in early Parkinson disease
and may decrease the dose of levodopa in advanced Parkinson disease. Unlike the ergotamine derivatives, these
agents do not exacerbate peripheral vascular disorders or cause fibrosis. Nausea, hallucinations, insomnia, dizziness,
constipation, and orthostatic hypotension are adverse effects of these drugs, but dyskinesias are less frequent than
with levodopa (Figure 8.11). Pramipexole is mainly excreted unchanged in the urine, and dosage adjustments are
needed in renal dysfunction. The fluoroquinolone antibiotics and other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450)
1A2 isoenzyme (for example, fluvoxamine) may inhibit the metabolism of ropinirole, requiring an adjustment in
ropinirole dosage. Figure 8.12 summarizes some properties of dopamine agonists.

E.  Amantadine
It was accidentally discovered that the antiviral drug amantadine [a-MAN-ta-deen] has an antiparkinsonian action.
Amantadine has several effects on a number of neurotransmitters implicated in parkinsonism, including increasing
the release of dopamine, blocking cholinergic receptors, and inhibiting the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type of
glutamate receptors. The drug may cause restlessness, agitation, confusion, and hallucinations, and, at high doses, it
may induce acute toxic psychosis. Orthostatic hypotension, urinary retention, peripheral edema, and dry mouth also
may occur. Amantadine is less efficacious than levodopa, and tolerance develops more readily. However,
amantadine has fewer adverse effects.
323
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 324 ---

F.  Antimuscarinic agents
The antimuscarinic agents are much less efficacious than levodopa and play only an adjuvant role in
antiparkinsonism therapy. The actions of benztropine [BENZ-troe-peen] and trihexyphenidyl  [tri-hex-ee-FEN-i-dill]
are similar, although individual patients may respond more favorably to one drug or the other. Blockade of
cholinergic transmission produces effects similar to augmentation of dopaminergic transmission, since it helps to
correct the imbalance in the dopamine/acetylcholine activity (Figure 8.4). These agents can induce mood changes
and confusion, and produce xerostomia, constipation, and visual problems typical of muscarinic blockers (see
Chapter 5). They interfere with gastrointestinal peristalsis and are contraindicated in patients with glaucoma,
prostatic hyperplasia, or pyloric stenosis.

VII.  Drugs Used in Alzheimer Disease
Dementia of the Alzheimer type has three distinguishing features: 1) accumulation of senile plaques (β-amyloid
accumulations), 2) formation of numerous neurofibrillary tangles, and 3) loss of cortical neurons, particularly
cholinergic neurons. Current therapies aim to either improve cholinergic transmission within the CNS or prevent
excitotoxic actions resulting from overstimulation of NMDA-glutamate receptors in selected areas of the brain.
Pharmacologic intervention for Alzheimer disease is only palliative and provides modest short-term benefit. None of
the available therapeutic agents alter the underlying neurodegenerative process.
325
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 326 ---

A.  Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors
Numerous studies have linked the progressive loss of cholinergic neurons and, presumably, cholinergic transmission
within the cortex to the memory loss that is a hallmark symptom of Alzheimer disease. It is postulated that inhibition
of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) within the CNS improves cholinergic transmission, at least at those neurons that are
still functioning. The reversible AChE inhibitors approved for the treatment of Alzheimer disease include donepezil
[doe-NE-peh-zil], galantamine [ga-LAN-ta-meen], and rivastigmine [ri-va-STIG-meen]. These agents have some
selectivity for AChE in the CNS, as compared to the periphery. Galantamine may also augment the action of
acetylcholine at nicotinic receptors in the CNS. At best, these compounds may provide a modest reduction in the
rate of loss of cognitive functioning in Alzheimer patients. Rivastigmine is the only agent approved for the
management of dementia associated with Parkinson disease and also the only AChE inhibitor available as a
transdermal formulation. Rivastigmine is hydrolyzed by AChE to a carbamylated metabolite and has no interactions
with drugs that alter the activity of CYP450 enzymes. The other agents are substrates for CYP450 and have a
potential for such interactions. Common adverse effects include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia, tremors,
bradycardia, and muscle cramps (Figure 8.13).

--- PAGE 329 ---

B.  NMDA receptor antagonist
Stimulation of glutamate receptors in the CNS appears to be critical for the formation of certain memories.
However, overstimulation of glutamate receptors, particularly of the NMDA type, may result in excitotoxic effects
on neurons and is suggested as a mechanism for neurodegenerative or apoptotic (programmed cell death) processes.
Binding of glutamate to the NMDA receptor assists in the opening of an ion channel that allows Ca2+ to enter the
neuron. Excess intracellular Ca2+ can activate a number of processes that ultimately damage neurons and lead to
apoptosis. Memantine [meh-MAN-teen] is an NMDA receptor antagonist indicated for moderate to severe
Alzheimer disease. It acts by blocking the NMDA receptor and limiting Ca2+ influx into the neuron, such that toxic
intracellular levels are not achieved. Memantine is well tolerated, with few dose-dependent adverse events. Expected
adverse effects, such as confusion, agitation, and restlessness, are often indistinguishable from the symptoms of
Alzheimer disease. Given its different mechanism of action and possible neuroprotective effects, memantine is often
given in combination with an AChE inhibitor.

VIII.  Drugs Used in Multiple Sclerosis
MS is an autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS. The course of MS is variable. For some, MS
may consist of one or two acute neurologic episodes. In others, it is a chronic, relapsing, or progressive disease that
may span 10 to 20 years. Historically, corticosteroids (for example, dexamethasone and prednisone) have been used
to treat acute exacerbations of the disease. Chemotherapeutic agents, such as cyclophosphamide and azathioprine,
have also been used.
330
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 331 ---

A.  Disease-modifying therapies
Drugs currently approved for MS are indicated to decrease relapse rates or, in some cases, to prevent accumulation
of disability. The major target of these medications is to modify the immune response through inhibition of white
blood cell–mediated inflammatory processes that eventually lead to myelin sheath damage and decreased or
inappropriate axonal communication between cells.
1.  Interferon b 1a and interferon b 1b
The immunomodulatory effects of interferon [in-ter-FEER-on] help to diminish the inflammatory responses that
lead to demyelination of the axon sheaths. Adverse effects of these medications may include depression, local
injection site reactions, increases in hepatic enzymes, and flu-like symptoms.
2.  Glatiramer
Glatiramer [gluh-TEER-a-mur] is a synthetic polypeptide that resembles myelin protein and may act as a decoy to
T-cell attack. Some patients experience a postinjection reaction that includes flushing, chest pain, anxiety, and
itching. It is usually self-limiting.
3.  Fingolimod
Fingolimod [fin-GO-li-mod] is an oral drug that alters lymphocyte migration, resulting in fewer lymphocytes in the
CNS. Fingolimod may cause first-dose bradycardia and is associated with an increased risk of infection and macular
edema.
4.  Teriflunomide
Teriflunomide [te-ree-FLOO-no-mide] is an oral pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor that leads to a lower concentration of
active lymphocytes in the CNS. Teriflunomide may cause elevated liver enzymes. It should be avoided in pregnancy.
5.  Dimethyl fumarate
Dimethyl fumarate [dye-METH-il FOO-ma-rate] is an oral agent that may alter the cellular response to oxidative
stress to reduce disease progression. Flushing and abdominal pain are the most common adverse events.
6.  Monoclonal antibodies
Alemtuzumab [AL-em-TOOZ-ue-mab], daclizumab [dah-KLIH-zyoo-mab], natalizumab [na-ta-LIZ-oo-mab], and
ocrelizumab [OK-re-LIZ-ue-mab] are monoclonal antibodies indicated for the treatment of MS. Ocrelizumab is the
first agent to be approved for primary progressive forms of the disease. These agents can be associated with
significant toxicities, such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy with natalizumab, serious infections with
daclizumab and alemtuzumab, and autoimmune disorders with alemtuzumab. As such, these agents may be reserved
for patients who have failed other therapies.
331

--- PAGE 332 ---

B.  Symptomatic treatment
Many different classes of drugs are used to manage symptoms of MS such as spasticity, constipation, bladder
dysfunction, and depression. Dalfampridine [DAL-fam-pre-deen], an oral potassium channel blocker, improves
walking speeds in patients with MS. It is the first drug approved for this use.
332

IX.  Drugs Used in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
ALS is characterized by progressive degeneration of motor neurons, resulting in the inability to initiate or control
muscle movement. Riluzole [RIL-ue-zole] and edaravone [e-DAR-a-vone] are indicated for the management of
ALS. Riluzole, an oral NMDA receptor antagonist, is believed to act by inhibiting glutamate release and blocking
sodium channels. Riluzole may improve survival time in patients suffering from ALS. Edaravone is an intravenous
free radical scavenger and antioxidant that may slow the progression of ALS.

8.6Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
A 75-year-old man with moderate Parkinson disease is no longer responding to anticholinergic treatment for
his tremors and bradykinesia. Which combination of antiparkinsonian drugs is an appropriate treatment plan?
A.  Amantadine, carbidopa, and entacapone
B.  Levodopa, carbidopa, and entacapone
C.  Pramipexole, carbidopa, and entacapone
D.  Ropinirole, carbidopa, and selegiline
Correct answer = B. To reduce the dose of levodopa and its peripheral side effects, the peripheral decarboxylase
inhibitor, carbidopa, is coadministered. As a result of this combination, more levodopa is available for
metabolism by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) to 3-O-methyldopa, which competes with levodopa for the
active transport processes into the CNS. By administering entacapone (an inhibitor of COMT), the competing
product is not formed, and more levodopa enters the brain. The other choices are not appropriate because neither
peripheral decarboxylase, nor COMT, nor monoamine oxidase metabolizes amantadine or the direct-acting
dopamine agonists ropinirole and pramipexole; thus carbidopa and entacapone should only be given with
levodopa, otherwise they are not contributing to the clinical response of the patient.
Peripheral adverse effects of levodopa, including nausea, hypotension, and cardiac arrhythmias, can be
diminished by including which drug in the therapy?
A.  Amantadine
B.  Ropinirole
C.  Carbidopa
D.  Entacapone
Correct answer = C. Carbidopa inhibits the peripheral decarboxylation of levodopa to dopamine, thereby
diminishing the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular side effects of levodopa. The other agents listed do not
ameliorate adverse effects of levodopa.
Which antiparkinsonian drug may cause vasospasm?
A.  Amantadine
B.  Bromocriptine
C.  Entacapone
D.  Ropinirole
Correct answer = B. Bromocriptine is a dopamine receptor agonist that may cause vasospasm. It is
contraindicated in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Ropinirole directly stimulates dopamine receptors,
but it does not cause vasospasm. The other drugs do not act directly on dopamine receptors.
Modest improvement in the memory of patients with Alzheimer disease may occur with drugs that increase
transmission at which receptor?
A.  Adrenergic
B.  Cholinergic
C.  Dopaminergic
D.  Serotonergic
Correct answer = B. AChE inhibitors, such as galantamine, increase cholinergic transmission in the CNS and may
cause a modest delay in the progression of Alzheimer disease. Increased transmission at the other types of
receptors listed does not result in improved memory.
A 70-year-old woman with moderate to severe dementia of the Alzheimer type has been treated with an
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor for 6 months at maximum dosing with minimal effect. Which medication is a
glutamate receptor antagonist that could provide added benefit for management of her moderate to severe
symptoms of Alzheimer disease?
A.  Rivastigmine
B.  Pramipexole
C.  Memantine
D.  Galantamine
Correct answer = C. When combined with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, memantine has modest efficacy in
keeping patients with Alzheimer disease at or above baseline for at least 6 months and may delay disease
progression. It is currently not approved for mild cognitive impairment or mild AD.
An 80-year-old male patient with moderate Alzheimer disease had a short trial of an oral medication for
Alzheimer disease and experienced frequent nausea, along with difficulty swallowing the medication. Which
agent is best for management of Alzheimer disease in this patient?334

8.7
8.8
8.9
8.10A.  Rivastigmine
B.  Donepezil
C.  Memantine
D.  Rotigotine
Correct answer = A. Rivastigmine is the only agent available as a transdermal delivery system (patch) for the
treatment of Alzheimer disease. It may also be used for dementia associated with Parkinson disease. Daily use of
the rivastigmine patch provides steady drug levels to treat Alzheimer disease, with a possible reduced incidence
of nausea. Rotigotine is available as a transdermal delivery system; however, it is indicated for Parkinson disease
and not for Alzheimer disease.
Which medication would benefit a 55-year-old female patient recently diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS)?
A.  Pramipexole
B.  Galantamine
C.  Riluzole
D.  Glatiramer
Correct answer = C. Riluzole is approved for the debilitating and lethal illness of ALS. It is used to, ideally, delay
the progression and need for ventilator support in severe patients. It is believed to work by decreasing the release
of glutamate from the presynaptic terminal.
A 48-year-old woman with relapsing multiple sclerosis has had intolerable adverse reactions to interferon
beta (depression) and dimethyl fumarate (angioedema) and now requires an alternative treatment option.
Which medication is most appropriate for this patient?
A.  Riluzole
B.  Rotigotine
C.  Teriflunomide
D.  Galantamine
Correct answer = C. Teriflunomide is believed to exert its disease modifying and anti-inflammatory effects by
inhibiting the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase to reduce pyrimidine synthesis. Teriflunomide may provide
an alternative treatment option with a different side effect profile compared to the prior two attempted treatments.
The other agents are not indicated for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.
Which agent may cause tremors as an adverse effect and, thus, should be used with caution in patients with
Parkinson disease, even though it is also indicated for the treatment of dementia associated with Parkinson
disease?
A.  Benztropine
B.  Rotigotine
C.  Rivastigmine
D.  Dimethyl fumarate
Correct answer = C. Though rivastigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, which can cause tremors as an
adverse effect, its use is not contraindicated in patients with Parkinson disease, as this agent is also the only
medication approved for dementia associated with Parkinson disease. It should be used with caution, as it may
worsen the parkinsonian-related tremors. A risk–benefit discussion should occur with the patient and the
caregiver before rivastigmine is used.
A 50-year-old male patient with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis reports continued difficulty
walking and the distance that he can walk before being overcome by fatigue. Which agent may be beneficial
to improve walking speed and disability in this patient?
A.  Dalfampridine
B.  Donepezil
C.  Riluzole
D.  Bromocriptine
Correct answer = A. Dalfampridine is a potassium channel blocker that exerts its therapeutic effect in multiple
sclerosis via potassium channel blockade and has been proven to improve walking speed and disability in patients
with multiple sclerosis. It is the only agent that is indicated to improve walking speed in patients with MS. The
other agents are not indicated for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.335

Anxiolytic and Hypnotic Drugs

--- PAGE 337 ---

I.  Overview
Disorders involving anxiety are among the most common mental disorders. Anxiety is an unpleasant state of
tension, apprehension, or uneasiness (a fear that arises from either a known or an unknown source). The physical
symptoms of severe anxiety are similar to those of fear (such as tachycardia, sweating, trembling, and palpitations)
and involve sympathetic activation. Episodes of mild anxiety are common life experiences and do not warrant
treatment. However, severe, chronic, debilitating anxiety may be treated with antianxiety drugs (sometimes called
anxiolytics) and/or some form of psychotherapy. Because many antianxiety drugs also cause some sedation, they
may be used clinically as both anxiolytic and hypnotic (sleep-inducing) agents. Figure 9.1 summarizes the anxiolytic
and hypnotic agents. Some antidepressants are also indicated for certain anxiety disorders; however, they are
discussed with the antidepressants (see Chapter 10).

II.  Benzodiazepines
Benzodiazepines are widely used anxiolytic drugs. They have largely replaced barbiturates and meprobamate in the
treatment of anxiety and insomnia, because benzodiazepines are generally considered to be safer and more effective
(Figure 9.2). Though benzodiazepines are commonly used, they are not necessarily the best choice for anxiety or
insomnia. Certain antidepressants with anxiolytic action, such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),
are preferred in many cases, and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics and antihistamines may be preferable for insomnia.

A.  Mechanism of action
The targets for benzodiazepine actions are the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors. [Note: GABA is the major
inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS).] The GABAA receptors are composed of a
combination of five α, β, and γ subunits that span the postsynaptic membrane (Figure 9.3). For each subunit, many
subtypes exist (for example, there are six subtypes of the α subunit). Binding of GABA to its receptor triggers an
opening of the central ion channel, allowing chloride through the pore. The influx of chloride ions causes
hyperpolarization of the neuron and decreases neurotransmission by inhibiting the formation of action potentials.
Benzodiazepines modulate GABA effects by binding to a specific, high-affinity site (distinct from the GABA-
binding site) located at the interface of the α subunit and the γ subunit on the GABAA receptor (Figure 9.3).
Benzodiazepines increase the frequency of channel openings produced by GABA. The clinical effects of individual
benzodiazepines correlate well with the binding affinity of each drug for the GABA receptor–chloride ion channel
complex.

B.  Actions
All benzodiazepines exhibit the following actions to some extent:
1.  Reduction of anxiety
At low doses, the benzodiazepines are anxiolytic. They are thought to reduce anxiety by selectively enhancing
GABAergic transmission in neurons having the α2 subunit in their GABAA receptors, thereby inhibiting neuronal
circuits in the limbic system of the brain.
2.  Sedative/hypnotic
All benzodiazepines have sedative and calming properties, and some can produce hypnosis (artificially produced
sleep) at higher doses. The hypnotic effects are mediated by the α1-GABAA receptors.
3.  Anterograde amnesia
Temporary impairment of memory with the use of the benzodiazepines is also mediated by the α1-GABAA
receptors. The ability to learn and form new memories is also impaired.
4.  Anticonvulsant
This effect is partially, although not completely, mediated by α1-GABAA receptors.
5.  Muscle relaxant
At high doses, the benzodiazepines relax the spasticity of skeletal muscle, probably by increasing presynaptic
inhibition in the spinal cord, where the α2-GABAA receptors are largely located. [Note: Baclofen [BAK-loe-fen] is a
muscle relaxant that is believed to affect GABA receptors at the level of the spinal cord.]

C.  Therapeutic uses
The individual benzodiazepines show small differences in their relative anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and sedative
properties. However, pharmacokinetic considerations are often important in choosing one benzodiazepine over
another.
1.  Anxiety disorders
Benzodiazepines are effective for the treatment of anxiety associated with panic disorder, generalized anxiety
disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder, performance anxiety, and extreme phobias, such as fear of flying. The
benzodiazepines are also useful in treating anxiety related to depression and schizophrenia. These drugs should be
reserved for severe anxiety and should not be used to manage the stress of everyday life. Because of their addictive
potential, they should only be used for short periods of time. The longer-acting agents, such as clonazepam [kloe-
NAZ-e-pam], lorazepam [lor-AZ-e-pam], and diazepam [dye-AZ-e-pam], are often preferred in patients with
anxiety that require prolonged treatment. The antianxiety effects of the benzodiazepines are less subject to tolerance
than the sedative and hypnotic effects. [Note: Tolerance is decreased responsiveness to repeated doses of the drug
that occurs when used for more than 1 to 2 weeks.] For panic disorders, alprazolam [al-PRAY-zoe-lam] is effective
for short- and long-term treatment, although it may cause withdrawal reactions in approximately 30% of patients.
2.  Sleep disorders
Benzodiazepine hypnotics decrease the latency to sleep onset and increase stage II of non–rapid eye movement
(REM) sleep. Both REM sleep and slow-wave sleep are decreased. In the treatment of insomnia, it is important to
balance the sedative effect needed at bedtime with the residual sedation (“hangover”) upon awakening. Short-acting
triazolam [try-AY-zoe-lam] is effective in treating individuals who have problems falling asleep. The risk of
withdrawal and rebound insomnia is higher with triazolam than with other agents. Intermediate-acting temazepam
[te-MAZ-e-pam] is useful for patients who experience frequent awakenings and have difficulty staying asleep.
Temazepam should be administered 1 to 2 hours before the desired bedtime. Long-acting flurazepam [flure-AZ-e-
pam] is rarely used, due to its extended half-life, which may result in excessive daytime sedation and accumulation
of the drug, especially in the elderly. Estazolam [eh-STAY-zoe-lam] and quazepam [QUAY-ze-pam] are considered
intermediate- and long-acting agents, respectively. In general, hypnotics should be used for only a limited time,
usually 1 to 3 weeks.
3.  Amnesia
The shorter-acting agents are often employed as premedication for anxiety-provoking and unpleasant procedures,
such as endoscopy, dental procedures, and angioplasty. They cause a form of conscious sedation, allowing the
patient to be receptive to instructions during these procedures. Midazolam [mi-DAY-zoe-lam] is a benzodiazepine
used to facilitate anterograde amnesia while providing sedation prior to anesthesia.
4.  Seizures
Clonazepam is occasionally used as an adjunctive therapy for certain types of seizures, whereas lorazepam and
diazepam are the drugs of choice in terminating status epilepticus (see Chapter 12). Due to cross-tolerance,
chlordiazepoxide [klor-di-az-e-POX-ide], clorazepate [klor-AZ-e-pate], diazepam, lorazepam, and oxazepam [ox-
AZ-e-pam] are useful in the acute treatment of alcohol withdrawal and reduce the risk of withdrawal-related
seizures.
5.  Muscular disorders
Diazepam is useful in the treatment of skeletal muscle spasms and in treating spasticity from degenerative disorders,
such as multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy.

D.  Pharmacokinetics
1.  Absorption and distribution
The benzodiazepines are lipophilic. They are rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration, distribute
throughout the body, and penetrate into the CNS.
2.  Duration of action
The half-lives of the benzodiazepines are important clinically, because the duration of action may determine the
therapeutic usefulness. The benzodiazepines can be roughly divided into short-, intermediate-, and long-acting
groups (Figure 9.4). The longer-acting agents form active metabolites with long half-lives. However, with some
benzodiazepines, the clinical duration of action does not correlate with the actual half-life (otherwise, a dose of
diazepam could conceivably be given only every other day, given its long half-life and active metabolites). This may
be due to receptor dissociation rates in the CNS and subsequent redistribution to fatty tissues and other areas.

--- PAGE 346 ---

Figure 9.4 Comparison of the durations of action of the benzodiazepines.
3.  Fate
Most benzodiazepines, including chlordiazepoxide and diazepam, are metabolized by the hepatic microsomal
system to compounds that are also active. For these benzodiazepines, the apparent half-life of the drug represents the
combined actions of the parent drug and its metabolites. The benzodiazepines are excreted in the urine as
glucuronides or oxidized metabolites. All benzodiazepines cross the placenta and may depress the CNS of the
newborn if given before birth. The benzodiazepines are not recommended for use during pregnancy. Nursing infants
may also be exposed to the drugs in breast milk.

--- PAGE 347 ---

E.  Dependence
Psychological and physical dependence can develop if high doses of benzodiazepines are given for a prolonged
period. All benzodiazepines are controlled substances. Abrupt discontinuation of these agents results in withdrawal
symptoms, including confusion, anxiety, agitation, restlessness, insomnia, tension, and (rarely) seizures.
Benzodiazepines with a short elimination half-life, such as triazolam, induce more abrupt and severe withdrawal
reactions than those seen with drugs that are slowly eliminated such as flurazepam (Figure 9.5).
Figure 9.5 Frequency of rebound insomnia resulting from discontinuation of
benzodiazepine therapy.
347
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 348 ---

F.  Adverse effects
Drowsiness and confusion are the most common adverse effects of the benzodiazepines. Ataxia occurs at high doses
and precludes activities that require fine motor coordination, such as driving an automobile. Cognitive impairment
(decreased recall and retention of new knowledge) can occur with use of benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines should
be used cautiously in patients with liver disease. Alcohol and other CNS depressants enhance the sedative–hypnotic
effects of the benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines are, however, considerably less dangerous than the older anxiolytic
and hypnotic drugs. As a result, a drug overdose is seldom lethal unless other central depressants, such as alcohol or
opioids, are taken concurrently.

III.  Benzodiazepine Antagonist
Flumazenil  [floo-MAZ-eh-nill] is a GABA receptor antagonist that rapidly reverses the effects of benzodiazepines.
The drug is available for intravenous (IV) administration only. Onset is rapid, but the duration is short, with a half-
life of about 1 hour. Frequent administration may be necessary to maintain reversal of a long-acting benzodiazepine.
Administration of flumazenil  may precipitate withdrawal in dependent patients or cause seizures if a benzodiazepine
is used to control seizure activity. Seizures may also result if the patient has a mixed ingestion with tricyclic
antidepressants or antipsychotics. Dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and agitation are the most common adverse effects.

350
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 351 ---

A.  Antidepressants
Many antidepressants are effective in the treatment of chronic anxiety disorders and should be considered as first-
line agents, especially in patients with concerns for addiction or dependence. SSRIs (such as escitalopram or
paroxetine) or serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs, such as venlafaxine or duloxetine) may be used
alone or prescribed in combination with a benzodiazepine during the first week of treatment (Figure 9.6). After 4 to
6 weeks, when the antidepressant begins to produce an anxiolytic effect, the benzodiazepine dose can be tapered.
While only certain SSRIs or SNRIs have been approved for the treatment of anxiety disorders such as GAD, the
efficacy of these drugs is most likely a class effect. Long-term use of antidepressants and benzodiazepines for
anxiety disorders is often required to maintain ongoing benefit and prevent relapse.
Figure 9.6 Treatment guideline for persistent anxiety.
351
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 352 ---

B.  Buspirone
Buspirone [byoo-SPYE-rone] is useful for the chronic treatment of GAD and has an efficacy comparable to that of
benzodiazepines. It has a slow onset of action and is not effective for short-term or “as-needed” treatment of acute
anxiety. The actions of buspirone appear to be mediated by serotonin (5-HT1A) receptors, although it also displays
some affinity for D2 dopamine receptors and 5-HT2A serotonin receptors. Thus, its mode of action differs from that
of the benzodiazepines. In addition, buspirone lacks the anticonvulsant and muscle-relaxant properties of the
benzodiazepines. The frequency of adverse effects is low, with the most common effects being headache, dizziness,
nervousness, nausea, and light-headedness. Sedation and psychomotor and cognitive dysfunction are minimal, and
dependence is unlikely. Buspirone does not potentiate the CNS depression of alcohol. Figure 9.7 compares common
adverse effects of buspirone and the benzodiazepine alprazolam.

V.  Barbiturates
The barbiturates were formerly the mainstay of treatment to sedate patients or to induce and maintain sleep. They
have been largely replaced by the benzodiazepines, primarily because barbiturates induce tolerance and physical
dependence, are lethal in overdose, and are associated with severe withdrawal symptoms. All barbiturates are
controlled substances.
355
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 356 ---

A.  Mechanism of action
The sedative–hypnotic action of the barbiturates is due to their interaction with GABAA receptors, which enhances
GABAergic transmission. The binding site of barbiturates on the GABA receptor is distinct from that of the
benzodiazepines. Barbiturates potentiate GABA action on chloride entry into the neuron by prolonging the duration
of the chloride channel openings. In addition, barbiturates can block excitatory glutamate receptors. These molecular
actions lead to decreased neuronal activity.
356
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 357 ---

B.  Actions
Barbiturates are classified according to their duration of action (Figure 9.8). Long-acting phenobarbital  [fee-noe-
BAR-bi-tal] has a duration of action greater than a day. Pentobarbital  [pen-toe-BAR-bi-tal], secobarbital  [see-koe-
BAR-bi-tal], amobarbital  [am-oh-BAR-bi-tal], and butalbital  [bu-TAL-bi-tal] are short-acting barbiturates.
Figure 9.8 Barbiturates classified according to their durations of action.
357
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 358 ---

1.  Depression of CNS
At low doses, the barbiturates produce sedation (have a calming effect and reduce excitement). At higher doses, the
drugs cause hypnosis, followed by anesthesia (loss of feeling or sensation), and, finally, coma and death. Thus, any
degree of depression of the CNS is possible, depending on the dose. Barbiturates do not raise the pain threshold and
have no analgesic properties. They may even exacerbate pain. Chronic use leads to tolerance.
2.  Respiratory depression
Barbiturates suppress the hypoxic and chemoreceptor response to CO2, and overdose is followed by respiratory
depression and death.
358
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 359 ---

C.  Therapeutic uses
1.  Anesthesia
The ultra–short-acting barbiturates have been historically used intravenously to induce anesthesia but have been
replaced by other agents.
2.  Anticonvulsant
Phenobarbital  has specific anticonvulsant activity that is distinguished from the nonspecific CNS depression.
However, phenobarbital  can depress cognitive development in children and decrease cognitive performance in
adults, and it should be used for seizures only if other therapies have failed. Similarly, phenobarbital  may be used
for the treatment of refractory status epilepticus.
3.  Sedative/hypnotic
Barbiturates have been used as mild sedatives to relieve anxiety, nervous tension, and insomnia. When used as
hypnotics, they suppress REM sleep more than other stages. However, the use of barbiturates for insomnia is no
longer generally accepted, given their adverse effects and potential for tolerance. Butalbital  is commonly used in
combination products (with acetaminophen and caffeine or aspirin and caffeine) as a sedative to assist in the
management of tension or migraine headaches.
359

--- PAGE 360 ---

D.  Pharmacokinetics
Barbiturates are well absorbed after oral administration and distribute throughout the body. All barbiturates
redistribute from the brain to the splanchnic areas, to skeletal muscle, and, finally, to adipose tissue. Barbiturates
readily cross the placenta and can depress the fetus. These agents are metabolized in the liver, and inactive
metabolites are excreted in urine.
360

E.  Adverse effects
Barbiturates cause drowsiness, impaired concentration, and mental and psychomotor impairment ( Figure 9.9). The
CNS depressant effects of barbiturates synergize with those of ethanol .

Figure 9.9 Adverse effects of barbiturates.
Hypnotic doses of barbiturates produce a drug “hangover” that may lead to impaired ability to function normally for
many hours after waking. Occasionally, nausea and dizziness occur. Barbiturates induce cytochrome P450
(CYP450) microsomal enzymes in the liver. Therefore, chronic barbiturate administration diminishes the action of
many drugs that are metabolized by the CYP450 system. Barbiturates are contraindicated in patients with acute
intermittent porphyria. Abrupt withdrawal from barbiturates may cause tremors, anxiety, weakness, restlessness,
nausea and vomiting, seizures, delirium, and cardiac arrest. Withdrawal is much more severe than that associated
with opioids and can result in death. Death may also result from overdose. Severe depression of respiration and
central cardiovascular depression results in a shock-like condition with shallow, infrequent breathing. Treatment
includes supportive care and gastric decontamination for recent ingestions.

VI.  Other Hypnotic Agents
364
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 365 ---

A.  Zolpidem
The hypnotic zolpidem [ZOL-pi-dem] is not structurally related to benzodiazepines, but it binds to GABAA
receptors with relative selectivity for those with the α1 subunit. Zolpidem has no anticonvulsant or muscle-relaxing
properties at hypnotic doses. It shows few withdrawal effects, exhibits minimal rebound insomnia, and little
tolerance occurs with prolonged use. Zolpidem is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. It has a rapid onset of
action and short elimination half-life (about 2 to 3 hours). The drug provides a hypnotic effect for approximately 5
hours (Figure 9.10). [Note: A lingual spray and an extended-release formulation are also available. A sublingual
tablet formulation may be used for middle-of-the-night awakening.] Zolpidem undergoes hepatic oxidation by the
CYP450 system to inactive products. Thus, drugs such as rifampin, which induce this enzyme system, shorten the
half-life of zolpidem, and drugs that inhibit the CYP3A4 isoenzyme may increase the half-life. Adverse effects of
zolpidem include headache, dizziness, anterograde amnesia, and next-morning impairment (especially with
extended-release formulations). Sleep-walking, sleep-driving, and performing other activities while not fully awake
have been reported. Unlike the benzodiazepines, at usual hypnotic doses, the nonbenzodiazepine drugs, zolpidem,
zaleplon, and eszopiclone, do not significantly alter the various sleep stages and, hence, are often the preferred
hypnotics. All three agents are controlled substances.

hypnotic agents.
365
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 366 ---

B.  Zaleplon
Zaleplon [ZAL-e-plon] is an oral nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic similar to zolpidem; however, zaleplon causes fewer
residual effects on psychomotor and cognitive function compared to zolpidem or the benzodiazepines. This may be
due to its rapid elimination, with a half-life of approximately 1 hour. The drug is metabolized by CYP3A4.
366
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 367 ---

C.  Eszopiclone
Eszopiclone [es-ZOE-pi-clone] is an oral nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic that has been shown to be effective for
insomnia for up to 6 months. Eszopiclone is rapidly absorbed (time to peak, 1 hour), extensively metabolized by
oxidation and demethylation via the CYP450 system, and mainly excreted in urine. Elimination half-life is
approximately 6 hours. Adverse events with eszopiclone include anxiety, dry mouth, headache, peripheral edema,
somnolence, and unpleasant taste.
367
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 368 ---

D.  Melatonin receptor agonists
Ramelteon [ram-EL-tee-on] and tasimelteon [tas-i-MEL-tee-on] are selective agonists at the MT1 and MT2 subtypes
of melatonin receptors. Melatonin is a hormone secreted by the pineal gland that helps to maintain the circadian
rhythm underlying the normal sleep–wake cycle. Stimulation of MT1 and MT2 receptors by ramelteon and
tasimelteon is thought to induce and promote sleep. They have minimal potential for abuse, and no evidence of
dependence or withdrawal has been observed. Therefore, ramelteon and tasimelteon can be administered long-term.
Ramelteon is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulty falling asleep (increased sleep
latency). Common adverse effects of ramelteon include dizziness, fatigue, and somnolence. Ramelteon may also
increase prolactin levels. Tasimelteon is indicated for non–24-hour sleep–wake disorder, often experienced by
patients who are blind. The most common adverse effects of tasimelteon are headache, abnormal dreams, increase in
liver function tests, and possible upper respiratory tract infections. CYP450 1A2 and 3A4 are the principle
isoenzymes required for metabolism of ramelteon and tasimelteon, and, thus, drug–drug interactions are possible
with inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes.

--- PAGE 369 ---

E.  Antihistamines
Antihistamines with sedating properties, such as diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, and doxylamine, are effective in
treating mild situational insomnia (see Chapter 37). However, they have undesirable adverse effects (such as
anticholinergic effects) that make them less useful than the benzodiazepines and the nonbenzodiazepines. Sedative
antihistamines are marketed in numerous over-the-counter products.
369
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 370 ---

F.  Antidepressants
The use of sedating antidepressants with strong antihistamine profiles has been ongoing for decades. Doxepin
[DOX-e-pin], an older tricyclic agent with SNRI mechanisms of antidepressant and anxiolytic action, is approved at
low doses for the management of insomnia. Other antidepressants, such as trazodone [TRAZ-oh-done], mirtazapine
[mir-TAZ-a-pine], and other older tricyclic antidepressants with strong antihistamine properties are used off-label
for the treatment of insomnia (see Chapter 10).
370

--- PAGE 371 ---

G.  Suvorexant
Suvorexant  [soo-voe-REX-ant] is an antagonist of the orexin receptor. Orexin is a neuropeptide that promotes
wakefulness. Antagonism of the effects of orexin suppresses the wake drive from this neuropeptide. This
antagonism may also explain the adverse events that are similar to signs of narcolepsy and cataplexy. The loss of
orexin-producing neurons is believed to be an underlying pathology for narcolepsy. Daytime somnolence and
increased suicidal ideation are other reported adverse effects. Suvorexant  is mainly metabolized by CYP450 3A4,
and, thus, it may have drug interactions with CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors.

9.6Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
Which one of the following statements is correct regarding benzodiazepines?
A.  Benzodiazepines directly open chloride channels.
B.  Benzodiazepines show analgesic actions.
C.  Clinical improvement of anxiety requires 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with benzodiazepines.
D.  All benzodiazepines have some sedative effects.
Correct answer = D. Although all benzodiazepines can cause sedation, the drugs labeled “benzodiazepines” in
Figure 9.1 are promoted for the treatment of sleep disorder. Benzodiazepines enhance the binding of GABAA to
its receptor, which increases the permeability of chloride. The benzodiazepines do not relieve pain but may reduce
the anxiety associated with pain. Unlike the tricyclic antidepressants and the monoamine oxidase inhibitors, the
benzodiazepines are effective within hours of administration. Benzodiazepines do not produce general anesthesia
and therefore are relatively safe drugs with a high therapeutic index.
Which one of the following is a short-acting hypnotic?
A.  Phenobarbital
B.  Diazepam
C.  Chlordiazepoxide
D.  Triazolam
Correct answer = D. Triazolam is a short-acting hypnotic agent. It causes little daytime sedation. The other
medications listed are longer acting with longer half-lives.
Which one of the following statements is correct regarding the anxiolytic and hypnotic agents?
A.  Diazepam and phenobarbital induce the cytochrome P450 enzyme system.
B.  Phenobarbital is useful in the treatment of acute intermittent porphyria.
C.  Phenobarbital induces respiratory depression, which is enhanced by the consumption of ethanol.
D.  Buspirone has actions similar to those of benzodiazepines.
Correct answer = C. Barbiturates and ethanol are a potentially lethal combination because of a high risk for
respiratory depression. Only phenobarbital strongly induces the synthesis of the hepatic cytochrome P450 drug-
metabolizing system. Phenobarbital is contraindicated in the treatment of acute intermittent porphyria. Buspirone
lacks the anticonvulsant and muscle-relaxant properties of the benzodiazepines and causes only minimal sedation.
A 45-year-old man who has been injured in a car accident is brought into the emergency department. His
blood alcohol level at admission is 275 mg/dL. Hospital records show a prior hospitalization for alcohol-
related seizures. His wife confirms that he has been drinking heavily for 3 weeks. What treatment should be
provided to the patient if he goes into withdrawal?
A.  No pharmacological treatment is necessary.
B.  Lorazepam.
C.  Phenytoin.
D.  Buspirone.
Correct answer = B. It is important to treat the seizures associated with alcohol withdrawal. Benzodiazepines such
as chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, or the shorter-acting lorazepam are effective in controlling this problem. They are
less sedating than phenytoin, have fewer adverse effects, and are cross-tolerant with alcohol. Buspirone will not
prevent the seizures associated with alcohol withdrawal.
A 36-year-old male patient reports difficulty falling asleep for the past 2 weeks but needs to be able to wake
up at 6 AM for work and doesn’t want any daytime sedation. Which medication is best to recommend for the
treatment of his insomnia?
A.  Temazepam
B.  Flurazepam
C.  Zaleplon
D.  Buspirone
Correct answer = C. Zaleplon has the shortest half-life and duration of action. Buspirone is not effective as a
hypnotic agent. Temazepam and flurazepam have a longer duration of action and reduce nighttime awakenings
but have a greater risk of daytime sedation or hangover effect compared with zaleplon.
A 45-year-old woman reports constant daytime anxiety about work and family problems. This is causing
difficulties functioning and participating in necessary daily activities. Which of the following agents has a
rapid anxiolytic effect and is best for the acute management of her anxiety?

9.10B.  Venlafaxine
C.  Lorazepam
D.  Escitalopram
Correct answer = C. The benzodiazepines have same-day, first-dose efficacy for anxiety, whereas the other agents
require 2 to 8 weeks for clinically significant improvement in anxiety to occur.
Which of the following sedative–hypnotic agents utilizes melatonin receptor agonist as the mechanism of
action to induce sleep?
A.  Zolpidem
B.  Eszopiclone
C.  Estazolam
D.  Tasimelteon
Correct answer = D. Tasimelteon is a melatonin receptor agonist to promote sleep, especially in those individuals
with non–24-hour sleep–wake disorder. Zolpidem, eszopiclone, and estazolam all utilize the benzodiazepine
receptor.
A 50-year-old man presents with insomnia not responsive to sleep hygiene interventions. He has a long
history of alcohol and opioid abuse. He has been successfully sober for 10 years but is very concerned about
future addiction and dependence. Which is most appropriate to address insomnia and minimize the risk for
dependence in this patient?
A.  Zaleplon
B.  Flurazepam
C.  Doxepin
D.  Zolpidem
Correct answer = C. Only doxepin, a tricyclic agent with significant antihistaminergic properties, is considered to
have no risk of addiction or dependence. The other agents are all controlled substances with some risk for
addiction or dependence, especially when used for extended periods.
A 68-year-old female patient is demonstrating signs and symptoms of insomnia, especially difficulty falling
asleep. She is afraid of taking a medication that can negatively affect her memory and concentration, as she
is still working as a bookkeeper. She has been taking temazepam for the past 4 days and has noticed a
memory problem and would like to discontinue this medication. Which medication is most appropriate to
treat the insomnia and minimize the risk for cognitive impairment?
A.  Diphenhydramine
B.  Zolpidem
C.  Alprazolam
D.  Ramelteon
Correct answer = D. All of these agents, except ramelteon, have been associated with cognitive impairments,
including memory impairment. Diphenhydramine likely causes its cognitive problems from its anticholinergic
and antihistaminergic effects. Zolpidem and alprazolam are well-known causes of cognitive impairment,
including anterograde amnesia. Ramelteon is a noncontrolled hypnotic agent acting as a melatonin receptor
agonist. It is not considered to have a risk for cognitive impairment compared with the other agents listed.
An 18-year-old woman is admitted to the emergency room after an accidental overdose of alprazolam. She is
unconscious and not considered a regular user of any medications or illicit drugs. Which treatment could be
used to reverse the effect of the alprazolam overdose?
A.  Diazepam
B.  Ramelteon
C.  Flumazenil
D.  Naloxone
Correct answer = C. Flumazenil is only indicated to reverse the effects of benzodiazepines via antagonism of the
benzodiazepine receptor. It should be used with caution because of a risk of seizures if the patient has been a
long-time recipient of benzodiazepines or if the overdose attempt was with mixed drugs. Naloxone is an opioid
receptor antagonist. The other agents are not efficacious in reversing effects of benzodiazepines.373

I.  Overview
The symptoms of depression are feelings of sadness and hopelessness, as well as the inability to experience pleasure
in usual activities, changes in sleep patterns and appetite, loss of energy, and suicidal thoughts. Mania is
characterized by the opposite behavior: enthusiasm, anger, rapid thought and speech patterns, extreme self-
confidence, and impaired judgment. This chapter provides an overview of drugs used for the treatment of depression
and mania.

II.  Mechanism of Antidepressant Drugs
Most antidepressant drugs ( Figure 10.1) potentiate, either directly or indirectly, the actions of norepinephrine and/or
serotonin (5-HT) in the brain. This, along with other evidence, led to the biogenic amine theory, which proposes that
depression is due to a deficiency of monoamines, such as norepinephrine and serotonin, at certain key sites in the
brain. Conversely, the theory proposes that mania is caused by an overproduction of these neurotransmitters.
However, the biogenic amine theory of depression and mania is overly simplistic. It fails to explain the time course
for a therapeutic response, which usually occurs over several weeks compared to the immediate pharmacodynamic
effects of the agents, which are usually immediate. This suggests that decreased reuptake of neurotransmitters is
only an initial effect of the drugs, which may not be directly responsible for the antidepressant effects.

III.  Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors
The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a group of antidepressant drugs that specifically inhibit
serotonin reuptake, having 300- to 3000-fold greater selectivity for the serotonin transporter, as compared to the
norepinephrine transporter. This contrasts with the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and serotonin-norepinephrine
reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) that nonselectively inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin ( Figure 10.2).
Moreover, the SSRIs have little blocking activity at muscarinic, α-adrenergic, and histaminic H1 receptors. Because
they have different adverse effects and are relatively safe in overdose, the SSRIs have largely replaced TCAs and
monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) as the drugs of choice in treating depression. The SSRIs include fluoxetine
[floo-OX-e-teen] (the prototypic drug), citalopram [sye-TAL-oh-pram], escitalopram [es-sye-TAL-oh-pram],
fluvoxamine [floo-VOX-e-meen], paroxetine [pa-ROX-e-teen], and sertraline [SER-tra-leen]. Escitalopram is the
pure S-enantiomer of citalopram.

--- PAGE 380 ---

A.  Actions
The SSRIs block the reuptake of serotonin, leading to increased concentrations of the neurotransmitter in the
synaptic cleft. Antidepressants, including SSRIs, typically take at least 2 weeks to produce significant improvement
in mood, and maximum benefit may require up to 12 weeks or more (Figure 10.3).
Figure 10.3 Onset of therapeutic effects of the major antidepressant drugs requires
several weeks.
380
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 381 ---

B.  Therapeutic uses
The primary indication for SSRIs is depression. A number of other psychiatric disorders also respond favorably to
SSRIs, including obsessive–compulsive disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress
disorder, social anxiety disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and bulimia nervosa (only fluoxetine is approved
for bulimia).
381
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 382 ---

C.  Pharmacokinetics
All of the SSRIs are well absorbed after oral administration. Peak levels are seen in approximately 2 to 8 hours on
average. Food has little effect on absorption (except with sertraline, for which food increases its absorption). The
majority of SSRIs have plasma half-lives that range between 16 and 36 hours. Metabolism by cytochrome P450
(CYP450)–dependent enzymes and glucuronide or sulfate conjugation occur extensively. Fluoxetine differs from the
other members of the class by having a much longer half-life (50 hours), and the half-life of its active metabolite S-
norfluoxetine is quite long, averaging 10 days. Fluoxetine and paroxetine are potent inhibitors of a CYP450
isoenzyme (CYP2D6). Other CYP450 isoenzymes (CYP2C9/19, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2) are involved with SSRI
metabolism and may also be inhibited to various degrees by the SSRIs.
382

--- PAGE 383 ---

D.  Adverse effects
Although the SSRIs are considered to have fewer and less severe adverse effects than the TCAs and MAOIs, the
SSRIs are not without adverse effects, such as headache, sweating, anxiety and agitation, hyponatremia,
gastrointestinal (GI) effects (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), weakness and fatigue, sexual dysfunction, changes in
weight, sleep disturbances (insomnia and somnolence), and the above-mentioned potential for drug–drug
interactions (Figure 10.4).

--- PAGE 385 ---

Figure 10.4 Some commonly observed adverse effects of selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors.
1.  Sleep disturbances
Paroxetine and fluvoxamine are generally more sedating than activating, and they may be useful in patients who
have difficulty sleeping. Conversely, patients who are fatigued or complaining of excessive somnolence may benefit
from one of the more activating SSRIs, such as fluoxetine or sertraline.
2.  Sexual dysfunction
Sexual dysfunction, which may include loss of libido, delayed ejaculation, and anorgasmia, is common with the
SSRIs.
3.  Use in children and teenagers
Antidepressants should be used cautiously in children and teenagers, because of reports of suicidal ideation as a
result of SSRI treatment. Pediatric patients should be observed for worsening depression and suicidal thinking with
initiation or dosage change of any antidepressant. Fluoxetine, sertraline, and fluvoxamine are approved for use in
children to treat obsessive–compulsive disorder, and fluoxetine and escitalopram are approved to treat childhood
depression.
4.  Overdose
Overdose with SSRIs does not usually cause cardiac arrhythmias, with the exception of citalopram, which may
cause QT prolongation. Seizures are a possibility because all antidepressants may lower the seizure threshold. SSRIs
have the potential to cause serotonin syndrome, especially when used in the presence of an MAOI or other highly
serotonergic drug. Serotonin syndrome may include the symptoms of hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, sweating,
myoclonus (clonic muscle twitching), and changes in mental status and vital signs.
5.  Discontinuation syndrome
SSRIs have the potential to cause a discontinuation syndrome after their abrupt withdrawal, particularly the agents
with shorter half-lives and inactive metabolites. Fluoxetine has the lowest risk of causing an SSRI discontinuation
syndrome due to its longer half-life and active metabolite. Possible signs and symptoms of SSRI discontinuation
syndrome include headache, malaise and flu-like symptoms, agitation and irritability, nervousness, and changes in
sleep pattern.

IV.  Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors
Venlafaxine [VEN-la-fax-een], desvenlafaxine [dez-VEN-la-fax-een], levomilnacipran [lee-voe-mil-NA-si-pran],
and duloxetine [doo-LOX-e-teen] inhibit the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine (Figure 10.5) and, thus,
are termed SNRIs. Depression is often accompanied by chronic pain, such as backache and muscle aches, for which
SSRIs are relatively ineffective. This pain is, in part, modulated by serotonin and norepinephrine pathways in the
central nervous system. With dual inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, both the SNRIs and the
TCAs may be effective in relieving pain. These agents are also used in the treatment of pain syndromes, such as
diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, fibromyalgia, and low back pain. The SNRIs, unlike the
TCAs, have little activity at α-adrenergic, muscarinic, or histamine receptors and, thus, have fewer receptor-
mediated adverse effects than the TCAs. The SNRIs may precipitate a discontinuation syndrome if treatment is
abruptly stopped.

reuptake inhibitor antidepressant drugs.

--- PAGE 387 ---

A.  Venlafaxine and desvenlafaxine
Venlafaxine is an inhibitor of serotonin reuptake and, at medium to higher doses, is an inhibitor of norepinephrine
reuptake. Venlafaxine has minimal inhibition of the CYP450 isoenzymes and is a substrate of the CYP2D6
isoenzyme. Desvenlafaxine is the active, demethylated metabolite of venlafaxine. The most common side effects of
venlafaxine are nausea, headache, sexual dysfunction, dizziness, insomnia, sedation, and constipation. At high doses,
there may be an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. The clinical activity and adverse effect profile of
desvenlafaxine are similar to that of venlafaxine.
387
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 388 ---

B.  Duloxetine
Duloxetine inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake at all doses. It is extensively metabolized in the liver to
inactive metabolites and should be avoided in patients with liver dysfunction. GI side effects are common with
duloxetine, including nausea, dry mouth, and constipation. Insomnia, dizziness, somnolence, sweating, and sexual
dysfunction are also seen. Duloxetine may increase blood pressure or heart rate. Duloxetine is a moderate inhibitor
of CYP2D6 isoenzymes and may increase concentrations of drugs metabolized by this pathway, such as
antipsychotics.
388
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 389 ---

C.  Levomilnacipran
Levomilnacipran is an enantiomer of milnacipran (an older SNRI used for the treatment of depression in Europe and
fibromyalgia in the United States). The adverse effect profile of levomilnacipran is similar to other SNRIs. It is
primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, and, thus, activity may be altered by inducers or inhibitors of this enzyme
system.
389

--- PAGE 390 ---

V.  Atypical Antidepressants
The atypical antidepressants are a mixed group of agents that have actions at several different sites. This group
includes bupropion [byoo-PROE-pee-on], mirtazapine [mir-TAZ-a-peen], nefazodone [ne-FAZ-oh-done], trazodone
[TRAZ-oh-done], vilazodone [vil-AZ-oh-done], and vortioxetine [vor-TEE-ox-e-teen].
390
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 391 ---

A.  Bupropion
Bupropion is a weak dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that is used to alleviate the symptoms of
depression. Bupropion is also useful for decreasing cravings and attenuating withdrawal symptoms of nicotine in
patients trying to quit smoking. Side effects may include dry mouth, sweating, nervousness, tremor, and a dose-
dependent increased risk for seizures. It has a very low incidence of sexual dysfunction. Bupropion is metabolized
by the CYP2B6 pathway and has a relatively low risk for drug–drug interactions, given the few agents that
inhibit/induce this enzyme. Use of bupropion should be avoided in patients at risk for seizures or those who have
eating disorders such as bulimia.
391
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 392 ---

B.  Mirtazapine
Mirtazapine enhances serotonin and norepinephrine neurotransmission by serving as an antagonist at central
presynaptic α2 receptors. Additionally, some of the antidepressant activity may be related to antagonism at 5-HT2
receptors. It is sedating because of its potent antihistaminic activity, but it does not cause the antimuscarinic side
effects of the TCAs or interfere with sexual function like the SSRIs. Sedation, increased appetite, and weight gain
frequently occur (Figure 10.6).
Figure 10.6 Some commonly observed adverse effects of mirtazapine.
392
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 393 ---

C.  Nefazodone and trazodone
These drugs are weak inhibitors of serotonin reuptake and are also antagonists at the postsynaptic 5-HT2a receptor.
Both agents are sedating, probably because of their potent histamine H1-blocking activity. Trazodone is commonly
used off-label for the management of insomnia. Trazodone has been associated with priapism, and nefazodone has
been associated with a risk for hepatotoxicity. Both agents also have mild-to-moderate α1 receptor antagonism,
contributing to orthostasis and dizziness.
393
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 394 ---

D.  Vilazodone
Vilazodone is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a 5-HT1a receptor partial agonist. Although the extent to which the
5-HT1a receptor activity contributes to its therapeutic effects is unknown, this possible mechanism of action renders
it unique from that of the SSRIs. The adverse effect profile of vilazodone is similar to the SSRIs, including a risk for
discontinuation syndrome if abruptly stopped.
394
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 395 ---

E.  Vortioxetine
Vortioxetine utilizes a combination of serotonin reuptake inhibition, 5-HT1a agonism, and 5-HT3 and 5-HT7
antagonism as its suggested mechanisms of action to treat depression. It is unclear to what extent the activities other
than inhibition of serotonin reuptake influence the overall effects of vortioxetine. The common adverse effects
include nausea, constipation, and sexual dysfunction, which may be expected due to its serotonergic mechanisms.
395
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 396 ---

VI.  Tricyclic Antidepressants
The TCAs inhibit norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake into the presynaptic neuron and, thus, if discovered today,
might have been referred to as SNRIs, except for their differences in adverse effects relative to this newer class of
antidepressants. The TCAs include the tertiary amines imipramine [ee-MIP-ra-meen] (the prototype drug),
amitriptyline [a-mee-TRIP-ti-leen], clomipramine [kloe-MIP-ra-meen], doxepin [DOX-e-pin], and trimipramine
[trye-MIP-ra-meen], and the secondary amines desipramine [dess-IP-ra-meen] and nortriptyline [nor-TRIP-ti-leen]
(the N-demethylated metabolites of imipramine and amitriptyline, respectively) and protriptyline [proe-TRIP-ti-
leen]. Maprotiline [ma-PROE-ti-leen] and amoxapine [a-MOX-a-peen] are related “tetracyclic” antidepressant
agents and are commonly included in the general class of TCAs.
396
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 397 ---

A.  Mechanism of action
1.  Inhibition of neurotransmitter reuptake
TCAs and amoxapine are potent inhibitors of the neuronal reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin into presynaptic
nerve terminals. Maprotiline and desipramine are relatively selective inhibitors of norepinephrine reuptake.
2.  Blocking of receptors
TCAs also block serotonergic, α-adrenergic, histaminic, and muscarinic receptors. It is not known if any of these
actions produce the therapeutic benefit of the TCAs. However, actions at these receptors are likely responsible for
many of their adverse effects. Amoxapine also blocks 5-HT2 and dopamine D2 receptors.
397
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 398 ---

B.  Actions
The TCAs improve mood, in 50% to 70% of individuals with major depression. The onset of the mood elevation is
slow, requiring 2 weeks or longer ( Figure 10.3). Patient response can be used to adjust dosage. Tapering of these
agents is recommended to minimize discontinuation syndromes and cholinergic rebound effects.
398
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 399 ---

C.  Therapeutic uses
The TCAs are effective in treating moderate to severe depression. Some patients with panic disorder also respond to
TCAs. Imipramine is used as an alternative to desmopressin or nonpharmacologic therapies (enuresis alarms) in the
treatment of bed-wetting in children. The TCAs, particularly amitriptyline, have been used to help prevent migraine
headache and treat chronic pain syndromes (for example, neuropathic pain) in a number of conditions for which the
cause of pain is unclear. Low doses of TCAs, especially doxepin, can be used to treat insomnia.
399
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 400 ---

D.  Pharmacokinetics
TCAs are well absorbed upon oral administration. As a result of their variable first-pass metabolism in the liver,
TCAs have low and inconsistent bioavailability. These drugs are metabolized by the hepatic microsomal system
(and, thus, may be sensitive to agents that induce or inhibit the CYP450 isoenzymes) and conjugated with
glucuronic acid. Ultimately, the TCAs are excreted as inactive metabolites via the kidney.
400
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 401 ---

E.  Adverse effects
Blockade of muscarinic receptors leads to blurred vision, xerostomia, urinary retention, sinus tachycardia,
constipation, and aggravation of angle-closure glaucoma ( Figure 10.7). These agents affect cardiac conduction
similar to quinidine and may precipitate life-threatening arrhythmias in an overdose situation. The TCAs also block
α-adrenergic receptors, causing orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and reflex tachycardia. Sedation is related to the
ability of these drugs to block histamine H1 receptors. Weight gain is a common adverse effect of the TCAs. Sexual
dysfunction occurs in a minority of patients, and the incidence is lower than that associated with the SSRIs.

Figure 10.7 Some commonly observed adverse effects of tricyclic antidepressants.
All antidepressants, including TCAs, should be used with caution in patients with bipolar disorder, even during their
depressed state, because antidepressants may cause a switch to manic behavior. The TCAs have a narrow therapeutic
index (for example, five- to six-fold the maximal daily dose of imipramine can be lethal). Depressed patients who
are suicidal should be given only limited quantities of these drugs and be monitored closely. Drug interactions with
the TCAs are shown in Figure 10.8. The TCAs may exacerbate certain medical conditions, such as benign prostatic
hyperplasia, epilepsy, and preexisting arrhythmias.

Figure 10.8 Drugs interacting with tricyclic antidepressants. CNS = central nervous
system; MAO = monoamine oxidase.

--- PAGE 405 ---

VII.  Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors
Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is a mitochondrial enzyme found in nerve and other tissues, such as the gut and liver. In
the neuron, MAO functions as a “safety valve” to oxidatively deaminate and inactivate any excess neurotransmitters
(for example, norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin) that may leak out of synaptic vesicles when the neuron is at
rest. The MAOIs may irreversibly or reversibly inactivate the enzyme, permitting neurotransmitters to escape
degradation and, therefore, to accumulate within the presynaptic neuron and leak into the synaptic space. The four
MAOIs currently available for the treatment of depression include phenelzine [FEN-el-zeen], tranylcypromine [tran-
il-SIP-roe-meen], isocarboxazid [eye-soe-car-BOX-ih-zid], and selegiline [seh-LEDGE-ah-leen]. [Note: Selegiline
is also used for the treatment of Parkinson disease. It is the only antidepressant available in a transdermal delivery
system.] Use of MAOIs is limited due to the complicated dietary restrictions required while taking these agents.
405
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 406 ---

A.  Mechanism of action
Most MAOIs, such as phenelzine, form stable complexes with the enzyme, causing irreversible inactivation. This
results in increased stores of norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine within the neuron and subsequent diffusion of
excess neurotransmitter into the synaptic space (Figure 10.9). These drugs inhibit not only MAO in the brain but
also MAO in the liver and gut that catalyzes oxidative deamination of drugs and potentially toxic substances, such as
tyramine, which is found in certain foods. The MAOIs, therefore, show a high incidence of drug–drug and drug–
food interactions. Selegiline administered as the transdermal patch may produce less inhibition of gut and hepatic
MAO at low doses because it avoids first-pass metabolism.

--- PAGE 409 ---

B.  Actions
Although MAO is fully inhibited after several days of treatment, the antidepressant action of the MAOIs, like that of
the SSRIs, SNRIs, and TCAs, is delayed several weeks. Selegiline and tranylcypromine have an amphetamine-like
stimulant effect that may produce agitation or insomnia.
409
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 410 ---

C.  Therapeutic uses
The MAOIs are indicated for depressed patients who are unresponsive or intolerant of other antidepressants.
Because of their risk for drug–drug and drug–food interactions, the MAOIs are considered last-line agents in many
treatment settings.
410
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 411 ---

D.  Pharmacokinetics
These drugs are well absorbed after oral administration. Enzyme regeneration, when irreversibly inactivated, varies,
but it usually occurs several weeks after termination of the drug. Thus, when switching antidepressant agents, a
minimum of 2 weeks of delay must be allowed after termination of MAOI therapy and the initiation of another
antidepressant from any other class. MAOIs are hepatically metabolized and excreted rapidly in urine.
411
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 412 ---

E.  Adverse effects
Severe and often unpredictable side effects, due to drug–food and drug–drug interactions, limit the widespread use
of MAOIs. For example, tyramine, which is contained in foods, such as aged cheeses and meats, liver, pickled or
smoked fish, and red wines, is normally inactivated by MAO in the gut. Individuals receiving a MAOI are unable to
degrade tyramine obtained from the diet. Tyramine causes the release of large amounts of stored catecholamines
from nerve terminals, resulting in a hypertensive crisis, with signs and symptoms such as occipital headache, stiff
neck, tachycardia, nausea, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and, possibly, stroke. Patients must,
therefore, be educated to avoid tyramine-containing foods. Other possible adverse effects of treatment with MAOIs
include drowsiness, orthostatic hypotension, blurred vision, dry mouth, and constipation. SSRIs should not be
coadministered with MAOIs due to the risk of serotonin syndrome. Both SSRIs and MAOIs require a washout
period of at least 2 weeks before the other type is administered, with the exception of fluoxetine, which should be
discontinued at least 6 weeks before an MAOI is initiated. In addition, the MAOIs have many other critical drug
interactions, and caution is required when administering these agents concurrently with other drugs. Figure 10.10
summarizes the side effects of the antidepressant drugs.

VIII.  Serotonin–Dopamine Antagonists
While 60% to 80% of patients respond favorably to antidepressants, 20% to 40% experience a partial or poor
response to monotherapy. The serotonin–dopamine antagonists (SDAs), or atypical antipsychotics, are occasionally
used as adjunctive treatments to antidepressants in partial responders. Aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, quetiapine, and
the combination of fluoxetine and olanzapine are approved for use as adjuncts in major depressive disorder (MDD).

XI.  Treatment of Mania and Bipolar Disorder
The treatment of bipolar disorder has increased in recent years due to increased recognition of the disorder and also
an increase in the number of available medications for the treatment of mania.
416
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 417 ---

A.  Lithium
Lithium salts are used acutely and prophylactically for managing bipolar patients. Lithium is effective in treating
60% to 80% of patients exhibiting mania and hypomania. Although many cellular processes are altered by treatment
with lithium, the mode of action is unknown. The therapeutic index of lithium is extremely low, and lithium can be
toxic. Common adverse effects may include headache, dry mouth, polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, GI distress, fine
hand tremor, dizziness, fatigue, dermatologic reactions, and sedation. Adverse effects due to higher plasma levels
may indicate toxicity and include ataxia, slurred speech, coarse tremors, confusion, and convulsions. Thyroid
function may be decreased and should be monitored. Lithium is renally eliminated, and though caution should be
used when dosing this drug in renally impaired patients, it may be the best choice in patients with hepatic
impairment.
417
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 418 ---

B.  Other drugs
Several antiepileptic drugs, including carbamazepine, valproic acid, and lamotrigine (see Chapter 12) are approved
as mood stabilizers for bipolar disorder. Other agents that may improve manic symptoms include the older
(chlorpromazine and haloperidol ) and newer antipsychotics. The atypical antipsychotics risperidone, olanzapine,
ziprasidone, aripiprazole, asenapine, cariprazine, and quetiapine (see Chapter 11) are also used for the management
of mania. Quetiapine, lurasidone, and the combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine have been approved for bipolar
depression.

10.6Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
A 55-year-old teacher was diagnosed with depression. After 6 weeks of therapy with fluoxetine, his
symptoms improved, but he complains of sexual dysfunction. Which of the following drugs might be useful
for management of depression in this patient?
A.  Sertraline
B.  Citalopram
C.  Mirtazapine
D.  Lithium
Correct answer = C. Mirtazapine is largely free from sexual side effects. However, sexual dysfunction commonly
occurs with SSRIs (sertraline and citalopram), as well as with TCAs and SNRIs. Lithium is used for the treatment
of mania and bipolar disorder.
A 25-year-old woman has a long history of depressive symptoms accompanied by body aches and pain
secondary to a car accident. Which of the following drugs might be useful in this patient?
A.  Fluoxetine
B.  Sertraline
C.  Phenelzine
D.  Duloxetine
Correct answer = D. Duloxetine is an SNRI that can be used for depression accompanied by symptoms of pain.
SSRIs (fluoxetine and sertraline) and MAOIs (phenelzine) have little activity against pain syndromes.
A 51-year-old woman with symptoms of major depression also has angle-closure glaucoma. Which
antidepressant should be avoided in this patient?
A.  Amitriptyline
B.  Bupropion
C.  Mirtazapine
D.  Fluvoxamine
Correct answer = A. Because of its potent antimuscarinic activity, amitriptyline should not be given to patients
with glaucoma because of the risk of acute increases in intraocular pressure. The other antidepressants all lack
antagonist activity at the muscarinic receptor.
A 36-year-old man presents with symptoms of compulsive behavior. He realizes that his behavior is
interfering with his ability to accomplish his daily tasks but cannot seem to stop himself. Which drug would
be most helpful to this patient?
A.  Desipramine
B.  Paroxetine
C.  Amitriptyline
D.  Selegiline
Correct answer = B. SSRIs are particularly effective in treating obsessive–compulsive disorder, and paroxetine is
approved for this condition. The other drugs are less effective in the treatment of obsessive–compulsive disorder.
Which antidepressant has, as its two proposed principal mechanisms of action, 5-HT1a receptor partial
agonism and 5-HT reuptake inhibition?
A.  Fluoxetine
B.  Aripiprazole
C.  Maprotiline
D.  Vilazodone
Correct answer = D. In addition to inhibition of serotonin reuptake, the antidepressant activity of vilazodone may
be related to its 5-HT1a receptor agonism. Though aripiprazole is also proposed to have 5-HT1a partial agonism, it
is not a serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
Which antidepressant is the most sedating?
A.  Bupropion
B.  Duloxetine
C.  Doxepin
D.  Venlafaxine
Correct answer = C. Doxepin is the most sedating of the list due to its histamine-blocking activity.419

10.10Which mood stabilizer is completely renally eliminated and may be beneficial for patients with hepatic
impairment?
A.  Valproic acid
B.  Carbamazepine
C.  Lithium
D.  Risperidone
Correct answer = C. Lithium is the only agent for bipolar disorder that does not require hepatic metabolism and,
thus, may be dosed without issue in a hepatically impaired patient. However, if the patient had renal impairment,
the lithium dosage would have to be adjusted.
Which antidepressant has, as its two principal mechanisms of action, 5-HT2A receptor antagonism and α2
receptor antagonism?
A.  Fluoxetine
B.  Doxepin
C.  Maprotiline
D.  Mirtazapine
Correct answer = D. Mirtazapine is the only antidepressant with this combination of mechanisms of action that
are believed to contribute to its therapeutic effects.
Which mood-stabilizing agent is most likely to decrease the thyroid function?
A.  Carbamazepine
B.  Lithium
C.  Valproic acid
D.  Chlorpromazine
Correct answer = B. Lithium is best known for causing a drug-induced hypothyroidism in patients after long-term
use. Though it is possible with other mood stabilizers, lithium has the most reported cases, and thus, thyroid
function tests should be performed at baseline and during follow-up to monitor for this possible effect.
Which antidepressant agent has significant α1 receptor antagonism and, thus, is a poor choice in an elderly
female with depressive symptoms due to a higher risk of falls related to orthostatic hypotension?
A.  Venlafaxine
B.  Bupropion
C.  Escitalopram
D.  Amitriptyline
Correct answer = D. Venlafaxine, bupropion, and escitalopram have very little effect on decreasing blood
pressure (no α1 receptor antagonism) and are considered acceptable choices for treatment of depression in the
elderly. Amitriptyline is associated with a high risk for orthostasis in the elderly and should be avoided due to its
adverse effect profile and risk for falls.

Antipsychotic Drugs

I.  Overview
The antipsychotic drugs are used primarily to treat schizophrenia, but they are also effective in other psychotic and
manic states. The use of antipsychotic medications involves a difficult trade-off between the benefit of alleviating
psychotic symptoms and the risk of a wide variety of adverse effects. Antipsychotic drugs (Figure 11.1) are not
curative and do not eliminate chronic thought disorders, but they often decrease the intensity of hallucinations and
delusions and permit the person with schizophrenia to function in a supportive environment.
422

--- PAGE 423 ---

Figure 11.1 Summary of antipsychotic agents.
423
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 424 ---

II.  Schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is a type of chronic psychosis characterized by delusions, hallucinations (often in the form of voices),
and disturbances in thought. The onset of illness is often during late adolescence or early adulthood. It occurs in
about 1% of the population and is a chronic and disabling disorder. Schizophrenia has a strong genetic component
and probably reflects some fundamental developmental and biochemical abnormality, possibly a dysfunction of the
mesolimbic or mesocortical dopaminergic neuronal pathways.
424
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 425 ---

III.  Antipsychotic Drugs
The antipsychotic drugs are usually divided into first- and second-generation agents. The first-generation drugs are
further classified as “low potency” or “high potency.” This classification does not indicate clinical effectiveness of
the drugs but rather specifies affinity for the dopamine D2 receptor, which, in turn, may influence the adverse effect
profile of the drug.
425
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 426 ---

A.  First-generation antipsychotics
The first-generation antipsychotic drugs (also called conventional) are competitive inhibitors at a variety of
receptors, but their antipsychotic effects reflect competitive blockade of dopamine D2 receptors. First-generation
antipsychotics are more likely to be associated with movement disorders known as extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS),
particularly drugs that bind tightly to dopaminergic neuroreceptors, such as haloperidol  [HAL-oh-PER-i-dol].
Movement disorders are somewhat less likely with medications that bind less potently, such as chlorpromazine
[klor-PROE-ma-zeen]. No one drug is clinically more effective than another.
426
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 427 ---

B.  Second-generation antipsychotic drugs
The second-generation antipsychotic drugs (also called “atypical” antipsychotics) have a lower incidence of EPS
than the first-generation agents but are associated with a higher risk of metabolic adverse effects, such as diabetes,
hypercholesterolemia, and weight gain. The second-generation drugs owe their unique activity to blockade of both
serotonin and dopamine receptors.
1.  Drug selection
Second-generation agents are generally used as first-line therapy for schizophrenia to minimize the risk of
debilitating EPS associated with the first-generation drugs that act primarily at the dopamine D2 receptor. The
second-generation antipsychotics exhibit an efficacy that is equivalent to, and occasionally exceeds, that of the first-
generation antipsychotic agents. Differences in therapeutic efficacy among the second-generation drugs have not
been established, and individual patient response and comorbid conditions must often be used to guide drug
selection.
2.  Refractory patients
Approximately 10% to 20% of patients with schizophrenia have an insufficient response to first- and second-
generation antipsychotics. For these patients, clozapine [KLOE-za-peen] has shown to be an effective antipsychotic
with a minimal risk of EPS. However, its clinical use is limited to refractory patients because of serious adverse
effects. Clozapine can produce bone marrow suppression, seizures, and cardiovascular side effects, such as
orthostasis. The risk of severe agranulocytosis necessitates frequent monitoring of white blood cell counts.
427
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 428 ---

C.  Mechanism of action
1.  Dopamine antagonism
All of the first-generation and most of the second-generation antipsychotic drugs block D2 dopamine receptors in the
brain and the periphery (Figure 11.2).
Figure 11.2 Dopamine-blocking actions of antipsychotic drugs.
2.  Serotonin receptor–blocking activity
Most of the second-generation agents exert part of their action through inhibition of serotonin receptors (5-HT),
particularly 5-HT2A receptors. Clozapine has high affinity for D1, D4, 5-HT2, muscarinic, and α-adrenergic
428
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 429 ---

receptors, but it is also a weak dopamine D2 receptor antagonist (Figure 11.3). Risperidone [ris-PER-ih-dohn] blocks
5-HT2A receptors to a greater extent than it does D2 receptors, as does olanzapine [oh-LANZ-ah-peen]. The second-
generation antipsychotics aripiprazole [a-rih-PIP-ra-zole], brexpiprazole [brex-PIP-ra-zole], and cariprazine [kar-
IP-ra-zeen] are partial agonists at D2 and 5-HT1A receptors, as well as antagonists of 5-HT2A receptors. Quetiapine
[qwe-TY-uh-peen] is relatively weak at blockade of D2 and 5-HT2A receptors. Its low risk for EPS may also be
related to the relatively short period of time it binds to the D2 receptor. Pimavanserin [pim-a-VAN-ser-in] appears to
act as an inverse agonist and antagonist at the 5-HT2A receptor and the 5-HT2C receptor, with no appreciable affinity
for dopamine receptors. Pimavanserin is indicated for psychosis associated with Parkinson disease.
Figure 11.3 Relative affinities of clozapine , chlorpromazine, and haloperidol at D1 and
D2 dopaminergic receptors.

D.  Actions
The clinical effects of antipsychotic drugs reflect a blockade at dopamine and/or serotonin receptors. However,
many antipsychotic agents also block cholinergic, adrenergic, and histaminergic receptors (Figure 11.4). It is
unknown what role, if any, these actions have in alleviating the symptoms of psychosis. However, the undesirable
adverse effects of antipsychotic drugs often result from pharmacological actions at these other receptors.
Figure 11.4 Antipsychotic drugs block dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors as well
as adrenergic, cholinergic, and histamine-binding receptors.
1.  Antipsychotic effects
All antipsychotic drugs can reduce hallucinations and delusions associated with schizophrenia (known as “positive”
symptoms) by blocking D2 receptors in the mesolimbic system of the brain. The “negative” symptoms, such as
blunted affect, apathy, and impaired attention, as well as cognitive impairment, are not as responsive to therapy,
particularly with the first-generation antipsychotics. Many second-generation agents, such as clozapine, can
ameliorate the negative symptoms to some extent.
2.  Extrapyramidal effects
Dystonias (sustained contraction of muscles leading to twisting, distorted postures), Parkinson-like symptoms,
akathisia (motor restlessness), and tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements, usually of the tongue, lips, neck,
trunk, and limbs) can occur with both acute and chronic treatment. Blockade of dopamine receptors in the
nigrostriatal pathway is believed to cause these unwanted movement symptoms. The second-generation
antipsychotics exhibit a lower incidence of EPS.
3.  Antiemetic effects
The antipsychotic drugs have antiemetic effects that are mediated by blocking D2 receptors of the chemoreceptor
trigger zone of the medulla (see Chapter 40). Figure 11.5 summarizes the antiemetic uses of antipsychotic agents, as
well as other drugs that combat nausea.
431

--- PAGE 432 ---

432
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 433 ---

Figure 11.5 Therapeutic application of antiemetic agents.
4.  Anticholinergic effects
Some of the antipsychotics, particularly thioridazine [THYE-oh-RID-a-zeen], chlorpromazine, clozapine, and
olanzapine, produce anticholinergic effects. These effects include blurred vision, dry mouth (the exception is
clozapine, which increases salivation), confusion, and inhibition of gastrointestinal and urinary tract smooth muscle,
leading to constipation and urinary retention. The anticholinergic effects may actually assist in reducing the risk of
EPS with these agents.
5.  Other effects
Blockade of α-adrenergic receptors causes orthostatic hypotension and light-headedness. The antipsychotics also
alter temperature-regulating mechanisms and can produce poikilothermia (condition in which body temperature
varies with the environment). In the pituitary, antipsychotics that block D2 receptors may cause an increase in
prolactin release. Sedation occurs with those drugs that are potent antagonists of the H1-histamine receptor,
including chlorpromazine, olanzapine, quetiapine, and clozapine. Sexual dysfunction may also occur with the
antipsychotics due to various receptor-binding characteristics. Weight gain is also a common adverse effect of
antipsychotics and is more significant with the second-generation agents.
433

--- PAGE 434 ---

E.  Therapeutic uses
1.  Treatment of schizophrenia
The antipsychotics are the only efficacious pharmacological treatment for schizophrenia. The first-generation
antipsychotics are generally most effective in treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. The atypical
antipsychotics with 5-HT2A receptor–blocking activity may be effective in many patients who are resistant to the
traditional agents, especially in treating the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.
2.  Prevention of nausea and vomiting
The older antipsychotics (most commonly, prochlorperazine [PROE-klor-PER-a-zeen]) are useful in the treatment
of drug-induced nausea.
3.  Other uses
The antipsychotic drugs can be used as tranquilizers to manage agitated and disruptive behavior secondary to other
disorders. Chlorpromazine is used to treat intractable hiccups. Pimozide [PIM-oh-zide] is primarily indicated for
treatment of the motor and phonic tics of Tourette disorder. However, risperidone and haloperidol  are also
commonly prescribed for this tic disorder. Also, risperidone and aripiprazole are approved for the management of
disruptive behavior and irritability secondary to autism. Many antipsychotic agents are approved for the
management of the manic and mixed symptoms associated with bipolar disorder. Lurasidone [loo-RAS-i-done] and
quetiapine are indicated for the treatment of bipolar depression. Paliperidone [pal-ee-PER-i-dohn] is approved for
the treatment of schizoaffective disorder. Some antipsychotics (aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, and quetiapine) are used
as adjunctive agents with antidepressants for treatment-refractory depression.
434

--- PAGE 435 ---

F.  Absorption and metabolism
After oral administration, the antipsychotics show variable absorption that is unaffected by food (except for
ziprasidone [zi-PRAS-i-done], lurasidone, and paliperidone, the absorption of which is increased with food). These
agents readily pass into the brain and have a large volume of distribution. They are metabolized to many different
metabolites, usually by the cytochrome P-450 system in the liver, particularly the CYP2D6, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4
isoenzymes. Some metabolites are active and have been developed as pharmacological agents themselves (for
example, paliperidone is the active metabolite of risperidone, and the antidepressant amoxapine is the active
metabolite of loxapine). Fluphenazine decanoate, haloperidol decanoate, risperidone microspheres, paliperidone
palmitate, aripiprazole monohydrate, aripiprazole lauroxil , and olanzapine pamoate are long-acting injectable
(LAI) formulations of antipsychotics. These formulations usually have a therapeutic duration of action of 2 to 4
weeks, with some having a duration of 6 to 12 weeks. Therefore, these LAI formulations are often used to treat
outpatients and individuals who are nonadherent with oral medications.

G.  Adverse effects
Adverse effects of the antipsychotic drugs can occur in practically all patients and are significant in about 80%
(Figure 11.6).
436

--- PAGE 438 ---

Figure 11.6 Adverse effects observed in individuals treated with antipsychotic drugs.
1.  Extrapyramidal effects
The inhibitory effects of dopaminergic neurons are normally balanced by the excitatory actions of cholinergic
neurons in the striatum. Blocking dopamine receptors alters this balance, causing a relative excess of cholinergic
influence, which results in extrapyramidal motor effects. The appearance of the movement disorders is generally
time- and dose dependent, with dystonias occurring within a few hours to days of treatment, followed by akathisias
occurring within days to weeks. Parkinson-like symptoms of bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor usually occur within
weeks to months of initiating treatment. Tardive dyskinesia (see below), which can be irreversible, may occur after
months or years of treatment.
If cholinergic activity is also blocked, a new, more nearly normal balance is restored, and extrapyramidal effects
are minimized. This can be achieved by administration of an anticholinergic drug, such as benztropine [BENZ-troe-
peen]. The therapeutic trade-off is a lower incidence of EPS in exchange for the adverse effect of muscarinic
receptor blockade. Akathisia may respond better to β-blockers (for example, propranolol ) or benzodiazepines, rather
than anticholinergic medications.
2.  Tardive dyskinesia
Long-term treatment with antipsychotics can cause this motor disorder. Patients display involuntary movements,
including bilateral and facial jaw movements and “fly-catching” motions of the tongue. A prolonged holiday from
antipsychotics may cause the symptoms to diminish or disappear within a few months. However, in many
individuals, tardive dyskinesia is irreversible and persists after discontinuation of therapy. Tardive dyskinesia is
postulated to result from an increased number of dopamine receptors that are synthesized as a compensatory
response to long-term dopamine receptor blockade. This makes the neuron supersensitive to the actions of
dopamine, and it allows the dopaminergic input to this structure to overpower the cholinergic input, causing excess
movement in the patient. Traditional anti-EPS medications may actually worsen this condition. Valbenazine [val-
BEN-a-zeen] and deutetrabenazine [doo-TET-ra-BEN-a-zeen] are inhibitors of the vesicular monoamine
transporter, and they are indicated for the management of tardive dyskinesia. These agents cause a decreased uptake
of monoamines into synaptic vesicles and depletion of monoamine stores, ideally focused on dopamine, to address
the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia.
3.  Neuroleptic malignant syndrome
This potentially fatal reaction to antipsychotic drugs is characterized by muscle rigidity, fever, altered mental status
and stupor, unstable blood pressure, and myoglobinemia. Treatment necessitates discontinuation of the antipsychotic
agent and supportive therapy. Administration of dantrolene or bromocriptine may be helpful.
4.  Other effects
Drowsiness occurs during the first few weeks of treatment. These agents may also cause confusion. Those
antipsychotics with potent antimuscarinic activity often produce dry mouth, urinary retention, constipation, and loss
of visual accommodation. Others may block α-adrenergic receptors, resulting in lowered blood pressure and
orthostatic hypotension. The antipsychotics depress the hypothalamus, thereby affecting thermoregulation and
causing amenorrhea, galactorrhea, gynecomastia, infertility, and erectile dysfunction. Significant weight gain is
often a reason for nonadherence. Glucose and lipid profiles should be monitored in patients taking antipsychotics, as
the second-generation agents may increase these laboratory parameters and possibly exacerbate preexisting diabetes
or hyperlipidemia. Some antipsychotics have been associated with mild to significant QT prolongation. Thioridazine
has the highest risk, and ziprasidone and iloperidone [eye-low-PER-ee-dohn] also have cautions with their use due
to this effect. Other antipsychotics have a general precaution regarding QT prolongation, even if the risk is relatively
low.
5.  Cautions and contraindications
All antipsychotics may lower the seizure threshold and should be used cautiously in patients with seizure disorders
or those with an increased risk for seizures, such as withdrawal from alcohol. These agents also carry the warning of
increased risk for mortality when used in elderly patients with dementia-related behavioral disturbances and
psychosis. Antipsychotics used in patients with mood disorders should also be monitored for worsening of mood and
suicidal ideation or behaviors.438

--- PAGE 439 ---

H.  Maintenance treatment
Patients who have had two or more psychotic episodes secondary to schizophrenia should receive maintenance
therapy for at least 5 years, and some experts prefer indefinite therapy. The rate of relapse may be lower with
second-generation drugs (Figure 11.7). Figure 11.8 summarizes the therapeutic uses of some of the antipsychotic
drugs.

therapy with either risperidone or haloperidol.

11.6Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
An adolescent male is newly diagnosed with schizophrenia. Which antipsychotic agent may have the best
chance to improve his apathy and blunted affect?
A.  Chlorpromazine
B.  Fluphenazine
C.  Haloperidol
D.  Risperidone
Correct answer = D. Risperidone is the only antipsychotic on the list that has some reported benefit in improving
the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. All of the agents have the potential to diminish the hallucinations and
delusional thought processes (positive symptoms).
Which of the following antipsychotics is a partial agonist at the dopamine D2 receptor?
A.  Brexpiprazole
B.  Clozapine
C.  Haloperidol
D.  Risperidone
Correct answer = A. Brexpiprazole is the only agent listed that acts as a partial agonist at D2 receptors.
Theoretically, the drug enhances action at these receptors under low dopamine conditions and blocks activation
when dopamine levels are high. All of the other drugs are antagonistic at D2 receptors.
A 21-year-old man has recently begun pimozide therapy for Tourette disorder. He has been having
“different-appearing tics,” such as prolonged contraction of the facial muscles, and he experiences
opisthotonos (extrapyramidal spasm of the body in which the head and heels are bent backward and the body
is bowed forward). Which of the following drugs would be beneficial in reducing these symptoms?
A.  Benztropine
B.  Bromocriptine
C.  Prochlorperazine
D.  Risperidone
Correct answer = A. The patient is experiencing EPS due to pimozide, and a muscarinic antagonist such as
benztropine would be effective in reducing the symptoms. The other drugs would have no effect or, in the case of
prochlorperazine and risperidone, might increase the adverse symptoms.
A 28-year-old woman with schizoaffective disorder (combination of mood and psychotic symptoms) reports
difficulty falling asleep. Which of the following would be most beneficial in this patient?
A.  Olanzapine
B.  Haloperidol
C.  Paliperidone
D.  Ziprasidone
Correct answer = C. Paliperidone is the only agent that is approved for schizoaffective disorder. Olanzapine has
significant sedative activity as well as antipsychotic properties and is the drug most likely to alleviate this
patient’s report of insomnia. Although other antipsychotics may benefit this patient’s disorder, paliperidone has
the indication for this disorder, and if the underlying disorder is improved, then the symptom of insomnia may
also improve without risking other unwanted adverse effects, such as the weight gain associated with olanzapine.
Which of the following antipsychotic agents is considered to be the most potent and thus have the highest
risk of extrapyramidal symptoms?
A.  Thioridazine
B.  Haloperidol
C.  Quetiapine
D.  Chlorpromazine
Correct answer = B. Among the older, conventional, or typical antipsychotics on this list, haloperidol is the most
potent and would thus be expected to have the highest incidence of EPS. The atypical antipsychotics listed
(quetiapine) could be considered low potency based on their common dosing and are considered to have the
lowest risk for EPS.
Which antipsychotic has the most sedative potential and is sometimes, questionably, used as a hypnotic agent
in certain clinical settings?
A.  Fluphenazine
B.  Thiothixene441

11.7
11.8
11.9
11.10C.  Quetiapine
D.  Haloperidol
Correct answer = C. Quetiapine has strong antihistaminergic effects causing sedation and is sometimes used at
low doses as a sedative–hypnotic, even though this use is considered off-label. The other antipsychotic agents
listed are weaker at blocking the histamine receptor and therefore are not as sedating.
A 30-year-old male patient is treated with haloperidol for schizophrenia. His psychotic symptoms are well
managed with haloperidol; however, he is reporting restlessness, the inability to sit still at the dinner table,
and his family notices that he frequently paces the hallway. Which is the best agent to treat this
antipsychotic-induced akathisia?
A.  Benztropine
B.  Dantrolene
C.  Bromocriptine
D.  Propranolol
Correct answer = D. Propranolol, a β-blocker, is considered the drug of choice for the management of
antipsychotic-induced akathisia. Benztropine is more effective for pseudoparkinsonism and acute dystonias.
Bromocriptine is more effective for Parkinson-like symptoms, and dantrolene is a muscle relaxant that is best
reserved for managing some symptoms of neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
Which antipsychotic agent is available in an LAI formulation that may be useful for patients with difficulty
adhering to therapy?
A.  Asenapine
B.  Chlorpromazine
C.  Clozapine
D.  Aripiprazole
Correct answer = D. Aripiprazole is available in two different LAI formulations. The other agents listed do not
have LAI formulations. Risperidone, fluphenazine, haloperidol, olanzapine, and paliperidone are other
antipsychotics that are available in LAI formulations.
Which antipsychotic agent is most associated with the possibility of a hematological dyscrasia such as
agranulocytosis in a patient being treated for schizophrenia?
A.  Chlorpromazine
B.  Buspirone
C.  Lithium
D.  Clozapine
Correct answer = D. Clozapine is the only antipsychotic medication that has a black box warning and a risk of
agranulocytosis in approximately 1% of the patients treated. This requires regular monitoring of white blood cell
counts. Although other antipsychotics have case reports of blood dyscrasias, clozapine is considered to have the
highest risk.
Which antipsychotic agent has been most associated with significant QT interval prolongation and should be
used with caution in patients with preexisting arrhythmias or patients taking other drugs associated with QT
prolongation?
A.  Thioridazine
B.  Risperidone
C.  Asenapine
D.  Lurasidone
Correct answer = A. Of the antipsychotic drugs listed, thioridazine has the highest risk for causing QT interval
prolongation. Although this is a general warning for many antipsychotics, thioridazine has been issued a “black
box warning,” suggesting that it is associated with the greatest risk.442

I.  Overview
Approximately 10% of the population has at least one seizure in their lifetime. Globally, epilepsy is the fourth most
common neurologic disorder after migraine, cerebrovascular disease (stroke), and Alzheimer’s disease. Epilepsy is
not a single entity but an assortment of different seizure types and syndromes originating from several mechanisms
that have in common the sudden, excessive, and synchronous discharge of cerebral neurons. This abnormal
electrical activity may result in a variety of events, including loss of consciousness, abnormal movements, atypical
or odd behavior, and distorted perceptions that are of limited duration but recur if untreated. The site of origin of
abnormal neuronal firing determines the symptoms that occur. For example, if the motor cortex is involved, the
patient may experience abnormal movements or a generalized convulsion. Seizures originating in the parietal or
occipital lobe may include visual, auditory, and olfactory hallucinations. Medications are the most widely used
mode of treatment for patients with epilepsy. In general, seizures can be controlled with one medication in
approximately 75% of patients. Patients may require more than one medication in order to optimize seizure control,
and some patients may never obtain total seizure control. A summary of antiseizure medications is shown in Figure
12.1.

II.  Etiology of Seizures
Epilepsy can be due to an underlying genetic, structural, or metabolic cause or an unknown etiology. In most cases,
epilepsy has no identifiable cause. The neuronal discharge in epilepsy results from firing of a small population of
neurons in a specific area of the brain referred to as the “primary focus.” Focal areas that are functionally abnormal
may be triggered into activity by changes in physiologic factors, such as an alteration in blood gases, pH,
electrolytes, and blood glucose and changes in environmental factors, such as sleep deprivation, alcohol intake, and
stress. A number of causes, such as illicit drug use, tumor, head injury, hypoglycemia, meningeal infection, and the
rapid withdrawal of alcohol from an alcoholic, can precipitate seizures. In cases when the source of a seizure can be
determined and corrected, medication may not be necessary. For example, a seizure that is caused by a drug reaction
is not epilepsy and does not require chronic therapy. In other situations, antiseizure medications may be needed
when the primary cause of the seizures cannot be corrected. Though multiple specific epilepsy syndromes that
include symptoms other than seizures have been classified, a discussion of these syndromes is beyond the scope of
this chapter.

III.  Classification of Seizures
It is important to correctly classify seizures to determine appropriate treatment. Seizures have been categorized by
site of origin, etiology, electrophysiologic correlation, and clinical presentation. Nomenclature developed by the
International League Against Epilepsy is considered the standard classification for seizures and epilepsy syndromes
(Figure 12.2). Seizures have been classified into two broad groups: focal and generalized.
Figure 12.2 Classification of epilepsy.
447

--- PAGE 448 ---

A.  Focal
Focal seizures involve only a portion of one hemisphere of the brain. The symptoms of each seizure type depend on
the site of neuronal discharge and on the extent to which the electrical activity spreads to other neurons in the brain.
Focal seizures may progress to become bilateral tonic–clonic seizures. Patients may lose consciousness or
awareness. This seizure type may begin with a motor or nonmotor activity.
448
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 449 ---

B.  Generalized
Generalized seizures may begin locally and then progress to include abnormal electrical discharges throughout both
hemispheres of the brain. Primary generalized seizures may be convulsive or nonconvulsive, and the patient usually
has an immediate loss of consciousness.
1.  Tonic–clonic
These seizures result in loss of consciousness, followed by tonic (continuous contraction) and clonic (rapid
contraction and relaxation) phases. The seizure may be followed by a period of confusion and exhaustion due to
depletion of glucose and energy stores.
2.  Absence
These seizures involve a brief, abrupt, and self-limiting loss of consciousness. The onset generally occurs in patients
at 3 to 5 years of age and lasts until puberty or beyond. The patient stares and exhibits rapid eye blinking, which
lasts for 3 to 5 seconds. An absence seizure has a very distinct three-per-second spike and wave discharge seen on
electroencephalogram.
3.  Myoclonic
These seizures consist of short episodes of muscle contractions that may recur for several minutes. They generally
occur after wakening and exhibit as brief jerks of the limbs. Myoclonic seizures occur at any age but usually begin
around puberty or early adulthood.
4.  Clonic
These seizures consist of short episodes of muscle contractions that may closely resemble myoclonic seizures.
Consciousness is more impaired with clonic seizures as compared to myoclonic.
5.  Tonic
These seizures involve increased tone in the extension muscles and are generally less than 60 seconds.
6.  Atonic
These seizures are also known as drop attacks and are characterized by a sudden loss of muscle tone.

--- PAGE 450 ---

C.  Mechanism of action of antiseizure medications
Drugs reduce seizures through mechanisms such as blocking voltage-gated channels (Na+ or Ca2+), enhancing
inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic impulses and interfering with excitatory glutamate transmission. Some
antiseizure medications appear to have multiple targets within the central nervous system (CNS), whereas the
mechanism of action for some agents is poorly defined. Antiseizure medications suppress seizures but do not “cure”
or “prevent” epilepsy.
450
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 451 ---

IV.  Drug Selection
Choice of drug treatment is based on the classification of the seizures, patient-specific variables (for example, age,
comorbid medical conditions, lifestyle, and personal preference), and characteristics of the drug (such as cost and
drug interactions). For example, focal-onset seizures are treated with a different set of medications than primary
generalized seizures, although the list of effective agents overlaps. The toxicity of the agent and characteristics of
the patient are major considerations in drug selection. In newly diagnosed patients, monotherapy is instituted with a
single agent until seizures are controlled or toxicity occurs (Figure 12.3). Compared with those receiving
combination therapy, patients receiving monotherapy exhibit better medication adherence and fewer side effects. If
seizures are not controlled with the first medication, monotherapy with an alternate medication or the addition of
medications should be considered (Figure 12.4). Failing that, other medical management (vagal nerve stimulation,
surgery, etc.) should be considered. Awareness of the antiseizure medications available and their mechanisms of
action, pharmacokinetics, potential for drug–drug interactions, and adverse effects is essential for successful
treatment of the patient.

V.  Antiseizure Medications
The Food and Drug Administration has approved many new antiseizure medications in the last few decades. Some
of these agents are thought to have potential advantages over older drugs in terms of pharmacokinetics, tolerability,
and reduced risk for drug–drug interactions. However, studies have failed to demonstrate that the newer drugs are
significantly more efficacious than are the older agents. Figure 12.5 summarizes pharmacokinetic properties of the
antiseizure medications, and Figure 12.6 shows common adverse effects. Suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation
have been identified as a risk with antiseizure medications. In addition, virtually, all antiseizure medications have
been associated with multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions, a rare idiosyncratic reaction characterized by rash, fever,
and systemic organ involvement.

therapy.

--- PAGE 457 ---

A.  Benzodiazepines
Benzodiazepines bind to GABA inhibitory receptors to reduce the firing rate. Most benzodiazepines are reserved for
emergency or acute seizure treatment due to tolerance. However, clonazepam [kloe-NAY-ze-pam] and clobazam
[KLOE-ba-zam] may be prescribed as adjunctive therapy for particular types of seizures. Diazepam [dye-AZ-e-pam]
is also available for rectal administration to avoid or interrupt prolonged generalized tonic–clonic seizures or clusters
when oral administration is not possible.
457
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 458 ---

B.  Brivaracetam
Brivaracetam [briv-a-RA-se-tam] is approved for treatment of focal-onset seizures in adults. It demonstrates high
and selective affinity for a synaptic vesicle protein (SV2A); however, the exact mechanism of antiseizure action is
unknown. The drug is well absorbed after oral administration and metabolized by both hydrolysis and CYP2C19
(minor). Comedication with strong CYP-inducing medications may lead to lower plasma concentrations.
Brivaracetam is a moderate inhibitor of epoxide hydrolase, resulting in increased levels of the active metabolite of
carbamazepine when the drugs are coadministered.
458
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 459 ---

C.  Carbamazepine
Carbamazepine [kar-ba-MAZ-a-peen] blocks sodium channels, thereby possibly inhibiting the generation of
repetitive action potentials in the epileptic focus and preventing spread. Carbamazepine is effective for treatment of
focal seizures, generalized tonic–clonic seizures, trigeminal neuralgia, and bipolar disorder. It induces its own
metabolism, resulting in lower total carbamazepine blood concentrations at higher doses. Carbamazepine is an
inducer of the CYP1A2, CYP2C, CYP3A, and UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes, which increases the
clearance of other drugs (Figure 12.7). Hyponatremia may be noted in some patients, especially the elderly, and may
necessitate a change in medication. Carbamazepine should not be prescribed for patients with absence seizures
because it may cause an increase in seizures.

D.  Eslicarbazepine
Eslicarbazepine [es-li-kar-BAZ-a-peen] acetate is a prodrug that is converted to the active metabolite
eslicarbazepine (S-licarbazepine) by hydrolysis. S-licarbazepine is the active metabolite of oxcarbazepine. It is a
voltage-gated sodium channel blocker and is approved for focal seizures in adults. Eslicarbazepine exhibits linear
pharmacokinetics and is eliminated via glucuronidation. The side effect profile includes dizziness, somnolence,
diplopia, and headache. Serious adverse reactions such as rash, psychiatric side effects, and hyponatremia occur
rarely.

--- PAGE 463 ---

E.  Ethosuximide
Ethosuximide [eth-oh-SUX-i-mide] reduces propagation of abnormal electrical activity in the brain, most likely by
inhibiting T-type calcium channels. It is most effective in treating absence seizures.
463
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 464 ---

F.  Felbamate
Felbamate [FEL-ba-mate] has a broad spectrum of anticonvulsant action with multiple proposed mechanisms
including the blocking of voltage-dependent sodium channels, competing with the glycine-binding site on the N-
methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor, blocking of calcium channels, and potentiating GABA action. It is
an inhibitor of drugs metabolized by CYP2C19 and induces drugs metabolized by CYP3A4. It is reserved for use in
refractory epilepsies (particularly Lennox-Gastaut syndrome) because of the risk of aplastic anemia (about 1:4000)
and hepatic failure.
464

--- PAGE 465 ---

G.  Gabapentin
Gabapentin [GA-ba-pen-tin] is an analog of GABA. However, it does not act at GABA receptors, enhance GABA
actions or convert to GABA. Although gabapentin binds to the α2δ subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, the
precise mechanism of action is not known. It is approved as adjunct therapy for focal seizures and treatment of
postherpetic neuralgia. Gabapentin exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics (see Chapter 1) due to its uptake by a
saturable transport system from the gut. Gabapentin does not bind to plasma proteins and is excreted unchanged
through the kidneys. Reduced dosing is required in renal disease. Gabapentin is well tolerated by the elderly
population with focal seizures due to its relatively mild adverse effects. It may also be a good choice for the older
patient because there are few drug interactions.
465

--- PAGE 466 ---

H.  Lacosamide
Lacosamide [la-KOE-sa-mide] affects voltage-gated sodium channels, resulting in stabilization of hyperexcitable
neuronal membranes and inhibition of repetitive neuronal firing. Lacosamide binds to collapsin response mediator
protein-2 (CRMP-2), a phosphoprotein involved in neuronal differentiation and control of axonal outgrowth. The
role of CRMP-2 binding in seizure control is unknown. Lacosamide is approved for adjunctive treatment of focal
seizures. The most common adverse events that limit treatment include dizziness, headache, and fatigue.

--- PAGE 467 ---

I.  Lamotrigine
Lamotrigine [la-MOE-tri-jeen] blocks sodium channels and high voltage–dependent calcium channels. Lamotrigine
is effective in a wide variety of seizure types, including focal, generalized, absence seizures, and Lennox-Gastaut
syndrome. It is also used to treat bipolar disorder. Lamotrigine is metabolized primarily to the 2-N-glucuronide
metabolite through the UGT1A4 pathway. As with other antiseizure medications, general inducers increase
lamotrigine clearance leading to lower lamotrigine concentrations, whereas divalproex results in a significant
decrease in lamotrigine clearance (higher lamotrigine concentrations). Lamotrigine dosages should be reduced when
adding valproate to therapy. Slow titration is necessary with lamotrigine (particularly when adding lamotrigine to a
regimen that includes valproate) due to risk of rash, which may progress to a serious, life-threatening reaction.

--- PAGE 468 ---

J.  Levetiracetam
Levetiracetam [lee-ve-tye-RA-se-tam] is approved for adjunct therapy of focal-onset, myoclonic, and primary
generalized tonic–clonic seizures in adults and children. It demonstrates high affinity for a synaptic vesicle protein
(SV2A). The drug is well absorbed after oral administration and is excreted in urine mostly unchanged, resulting in
few to no drug interactions. Levetiracetam can cause mood alterations that may require a dose reduction or a change
of medication.

--- PAGE 469 ---

K.  Oxcarbazepine
Oxcarbazepine [ox-kar-BAY-zeh-peen] is a prodrug that is rapidly reduced to the 10-monohydroxy (MHD)
metabolite responsible for its anticonvulsant activity. MHD blocks sodium channels and is thought to modulate
calcium channels. It is approved for use in adults and children with focal seizures. Oxcarbazepine is a less potent
inducer of CYP3A4 and UGT than is carbamazepine. The adverse effect of hyponatremia limits its use in the
elderly.

--- PAGE 470 ---

L.  Perampanel
Perampanel  [per-AM-pa-nel] is a selective α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid antagonist
resulting in reduced excitatory activity. Perampanel  has a long half-life enabling once-daily dosing. It is approved
for adjunctive treatment of focal and generalized tonic–clonic seizures. This medication has a warning for serious
psychiatric and behavioral reactions including aggression, hostility, irritability, anger, and homicidal ideation.

--- PAGE 471 ---

M.  Phenobarbital  and primidone
The primary mechanism of action of phenobarbital  [fee-noe-BAR-bih-tal] is enhancement of the inhibitory effects
of GABA-mediated neurons (see Chapter 9). Primidone is metabolized to phenobarbital  (major) and
phenylethylmalonamide, both with anticonvulsant activity. Phenobarbital  is used primarily in the treatment of status
epilepticus when other agents fail.
471

--- PAGE 472 ---

N.  Phenytoin and fosphenytoin
Phenytoin [FEN-i-toin] blocks voltage-gated sodium channels by selectively binding to the channel in the inactive
state and slowing its rate of recovery. It is effective for treatment of focal and generalized tonic–clonic seizures and
in the treatment of status epilepticus. Phenytoin induces CYP2C and CYP3A families and the UGT enzyme system.
Phenytoin exhibits saturable enzyme metabolism resulting in nonlinear pharmacokinetic properties (small increases
in the daily dose can produce large increases in plasma concentration, resulting in drug-induced toxicity; Figure
12.8). Depression of the CNS occurs particularly in the cerebellum and vestibular system, causing nystagmus and
ataxia. The elderly are highly susceptible to this effect. Gingival hyperplasia may cause the gums to grow over the
teeth (Figure 12.9). Long-term use may lead to development of peripheral neuropathies and osteoporosis. Although
phenytoin is advantageous due to its low cost, the actual cost of therapy may be higher, considering the potential for
serious toxicity and adverse effects.

Figure 12.9 Gingival hyperplasia in patient treated with phenytoin.
Fosphenytoin [FOS-phen-i-toin] is a prodrug that is rapidly converted to phenytoin in the blood within minutes.
Whereas fosphenytoin may be administered intramuscularly (IM), phenytoin sodium should never be given IM, as it
causes tissue damage and necrosis. Fosphenytoin is the drug of choice and standard of care for IV and IM
administration of phenytoin.

--- PAGE 474 ---

O.  Pregabalin
Pregabalin [pree-GA-ba-lin] binds to the α2δ site, an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels in the
CNS, inhibiting excitatory neurotransmitter release. The drug has proven effects on focal-onset seizures, diabetic
peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, and fibromyalgia. More than 90% of pregabalin is eliminated renally.
It has no significant effects on drug metabolism and few drug interactions. Dosage adjustments are needed in renal
dysfunction.

--- PAGE 475 ---

P.  Rufinamide
Rufinamide [roo-FIN-a-mide] acts at sodium channels. It is approved for the adjunctive treatment of seizures
associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in children one year of age and older and in adults. Rufinamide is a weak
inhibitor of CYP2E1 and a weak inducer of CYP3A4 enzymes. Food increases absorption and peak serum
concentrations. Serum concentrations of rufinamide are affected by other antiseizure medications. Carbamazepine
and phenytoi n can reduce and valproate can increase the serum concentrations of rufinamide. Adverse effects
include the potential for shortened QT intervals. Patients with familial short QT syndrome should not be treated with
rufinamide.
475

--- PAGE 476 ---

Q.  Tiagabine
Tiagabine [ty-AG-a-been] blocks GABA uptake into presynaptic neurons permitting more GABA to be available for
receptor binding and thereby enhancing inhibitory activity. Tiagabine is effective as adjunctive treatment in focal
seizures. In postmarketing surveillance, seizures have occurred in patients using tiagabine who did not have
epilepsy. Tiagabine should not be used for indications other than epilepsy.
476

--- PAGE 477 ---

R.  Topiramate
Topiramate [toe-PEER-a-mate] has multiple mechanisms of action. It blocks voltage-dependent sodium channels,
reduces high-voltage calcium currents (L type), is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, and may act at glutamate (NMDA)
sites. Topiramate is effective for use in focal and primary generalized epilepsy. It is also approved for prevention of
migraine. It mildly inhibits CYP2C19 and coadministration with phenytoin and carbamazepine may reduce serum
concentrations of topiramate. Adverse effects include somnolence, weight loss, and paresthesias. Renal stones,
glaucoma, oligohidrosis (decreased sweating), and hyperthermia have also been reported.
477
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 478 ---

S.  Valproic acid and divalproex
Possible mechanisms of action include sodium channel blockade, blockade of GABA transaminase (GABA-T), and
action at the T-type calcium channels. These varied mechanisms provide a broad spectrum of activity against
seizures. It is effective for the treatment of focal and primary generalized epilepsies. Valproic acid [val-PRO-ik A-
sid] is available as a free acid. Divalproex [dye-val-PRO-ex] sodium is a combination of sodium valproate [val-
PROE-ate] and valproic acid that is converted to valproate ion in the gastrointestinal tract. It was developed to
improve gastrointestinal tolerance of valproic acid. All of the available salt forms are equivalent in efficacy
(valproic acid and sodium valproate). Commercial products are available in multiple-salt dosage forms and
extended-release formulations. Therefore, the risk for medication errors is high, and it is essential to be familiar with
all preparations. Valproate inhibits metabolism of the CYP2C9, UGT, and epoxide hydrolase systems (Figure 12.7).
Rare hepatotoxicity may cause a rise in liver enzymes, which should be monitored frequently. Use in children under
age 2 and women should be avoided if possible.

T.  Vigabatrin
Vigabatrin [vye-GA-ba-trin] acts as an irreversible inhibitor of GABA-T. GABA-T is the enzyme responsible for
metabolism of GABA. Vigabatrin is associated with visual field loss ranging from mild to severe in 30% or more of
patients. Vigabatrin is only available through physicians and pharmacies that participate in the REMS (risk
evaluation and mitigation strategies) program.

--- PAGE 480 ---

U.  Zonisamide
Zonisamide [zoe-NIS-a-mide] is a sulfonamide derivative that has a broad spectrum of action. The compound has
multiple effects, including blockade of both voltage-gated sodium channels and T-type calcium currents. It has a
limited amount of carbonic anhydrase activity. Zonisamide is approved for use in patients with focal epilepsy. It is
metabolized by the CYP3A4 isozyme and may, to a lesser extent, be affected by CYP3A5 and CYP2C19. In
addition to typical CNS adverse effects, zonisamide may cause kidney stones. Oligohidrosis has been reported, and
patients should be monitored for increased body temperature and decreased sweating. Zonisamide is contraindicated
in patients with sulfonamide or carbonic anhydrase inhibitor hypersensitivity.

--- PAGE 481 ---

VI.  Status Epilepticus
In status epilepticus, two or more seizures occur without recovery of full consciousness in between episodes. These
may be focal or generalized, convulsive or nonconvulsive. Status epilepticus is life threatening and requires
emergency treatment usually consisting of parenteral administration of a fast-acting medication such as a
benzodiazepine, followed by a slower- acting medication such as phenytoin, fosphenytoin, divalproex, or
levetiracetam.
481

--- PAGE 482 ---

VII.  Women’s Health and Epilepsy
Women of childbearing potential with epilepsy require assessment of their antiseizure medications in regard to
contraception and pregnancy planning. Several antiseizure medications increase the metabolism of hormonal
contraceptives, potentially rendering them ineffective. These include phenytoin, phenobarbital , carbamazepine,
topiramate, oxcarbazepine, rufinamide, and clobazam. These medications increase the metabolism of contraceptives
regardless of the delivery system used (for example, patch, ring, implants, and oral tablets). Pregnancy planning is
vital, as many antiseizure medications have the potential to affect fetal development and cause birth defects. All
women considering pregnancy should be on high doses (1 to 5 mg) of folic acid prior to conception. Divalproex and
barbiturates should be avoided. If possible, women already taking divalproex should be placed on other therapies
before pregnancy and counseled about the potential for birth defects, including cognitive (Figure 12.10) and
behavioral abnormalities and neural tube defects. The pharmacokinetics of antiseizure medications and the
frequency and severity of seizures may change during pregnancy. Regular monitoring by both an obstetrician and a
neurologist is important. All women with epilepsy should be encouraged to register with the Antiepileptic Drug
Pregnancy Registry. Figure 12.11 summarizes important characteristics of the antiseizure medications.

12.6Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
A 9-year-old boy is sent for neurologic evaluation because of episodes of apparent inattention. Over the past
year, the child has experienced episodes during which he develops a blank look on his face and his eyes
blink for 15 seconds. He immediately resumes his previous activity. Which best describes seizures in this
patient?
A.  Focal
B.  Tonic–clonic
C.  Absence
D.  Myoclonic
Correct answer = C. The patient is experiencing episodes of absence seizures where consciousness is impaired
briefly. Absence seizures generally begin in children aged 4 to 12 years. Diagnosis includes obtaining an
electroencephalogram that shows generalized 3-Hz waves.
A child is experiencing absence seizures that interrupt his ability to pay attention during school and
activities. Which therapy is most appropriate for this patient?
A.  Ethosuximide
B.  Carbamazepine
C.  Diazepam
D.  Watchful waiting
Correct answer = A. The patient has had many seizures that interrupt his ability to pay attention during school and
activities, so therapy is justified. Carbamazepine may make the seizures more frequent. Diazepam is not indicated
for absence seizures.
Which drug is most useful for the treatment of absence seizures?
A.  Topiramate
B.  Tiagabine
C.  Levetiracetam
D.  Lamotrigine
Correct answer = D. Of the drugs listed, lamotrigine has the best data for use in absence seizures and is the best
choice. Tiagabine is only used for focal seizures. Topiramate and levetiracetam may be options if lamotrigine
does not work.
A 25-year-old woman with generalized seizures is well controlled on valproate. She indicates that she is
interested in becoming pregnant in the next year. With respect to her antiseizure medication, which of the
following should be considered?
A.  Leave her on her current therapy.
B.  Consider switching to lamotrigine.
C.  Consider adding a second antiseizure medication.
D.  Decrease her valproate dose.
Correct answer = B. Valproate is a poor choice in women of childbearing age and should be avoided if possible.
A review of the medication history of this patient is warranted. If she has not tried any other antiseizure
medication, then consideration of another antiseizure medication may be beneficial. Studies show that valproate
taken during pregnancy can have a detrimental effect on cognitive abilities in children. However, treatment with
valproate may not be avoidable as it could be the only choice for some women. In these cases, the lowest
effective dose should be used.
A woman with generalized seizures is well controlled with lamotrigine. She becomes pregnant and begins to
have breakthrough seizures. What is most likely happening?
A.  Her epilepsy is getting worse.
B.  Lamotrigine concentrations are increasing.
C.  Lamotrigine concentrations are decreasing.
D.  Lamotrigine is no longer efficacious for this patient.
Correct answer = C. Pregnancy alters the pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine. As pregnancy progresses, women can
require increased dosages to maintain blood concentrations and seizure control.
A 42-year-old man undergoes a neurologic evaluation because of episodes of apparent confusion. Over the
past year, the man has experienced episodes during which he develops a blank look on his face and fails to
respond to questions. Moreover, it appears to take several minutes before the man recovers from the
episodes. Which best describes this type of seizure?
A.  Focal (aware)484

12.7
12.8
12.9
12.10B.  Focal (impaired awareness)
C.  Tonic–clonic
D.  Absence
Correct answer = B. The patient is experiencing episodes of focal seizures with impaired consciousness.
Typically, staring is accompanied by impaired consciousness and recall. If asked a question, the patient might
respond with an inappropriate or unintelligible answer. Automatic movements are associated with most focal
seizures and involve the mouth and face (lip smacking, chewing, tasting, and swallowing movements), upper
extremities (fumbling, picking, tapping, or clasping movements), and vocal apparatus (grunts or repetition of
words and phrases), as are complex acts (such as walking or mixing foods in a bowl).
A 52-year-old man has had several focal seizures with impaired consciousness over the last year. Which is
the most appropriate initial therapy for this patient?
A.  Ethosuximide
B.  Levetiracetam
C.  Diazepam
D.  Carbamazepine plus primidone
Correct answer = B. The patient has had many seizures, and the risks of not starting drug therapy would be
substantially greater than the risks of treating his seizures. Because the patient has impaired consciousness during
the seizure, he is at risk for injury during an attack. Monotherapy with primary agents is preferred for most
patients. The advantages of monotherapy include reduced frequency of adverse effects, absence of interactions
between antiepileptic drugs, lower cost, and improved compliance. Ethosuximide and diazepam are not indicated
for focal seizures.
A patient with focal seizures has been treated for 6 months with carbamazepine but, recently, has been
experiencing breakthrough seizures on a more frequent basis. You are considering adding a second drug to
the antiseizure regimen. Which of the following drugs is least likely to have a pharmacokinetic interaction
with carbamazepine?
A.  Topiramate
B.  Tiagabine
C.  Levetiracetam
D.  Lamotrigine
Correct answer = C. Of the drugs listed, all of which are approved as adjunct therapy for refractory focal seizures,
only levetiracetam does not affect the pharmacokinetics of other antiepileptic drugs, and other drugs do not
significantly alter its pharmacokinetics. However, any of the listed drugs could be added depending on the plan
and the patient characteristics. Treatment of epilepsy is complex, and diagnosis is based on history and may need
to be reevaluated when drug therapy fails or seizures increase.
Which is a first-line medication for generalized tonic–clonic seizures?
A.  Ethosuximide
B.  Felbamate
C.  Vigabatrin
D.  Topiramate
Correct answer = D. Topiramate is a broad-spectrum antiseizure medication that is indicated for primary
generalized tonic–clonic seizures. Ethosuximide should only be used for absence seizures. Felbamate is reserved
for refractory seizures due to the risk of aplastic anemia and liver failure. Vigabatrin is not indicated for
generalized seizures and is associated with visual field defects.
A 75-year-old woman had a stroke approximately 1 month ago. She is continuing to have small focal
seizures where she fails to respond appropriately while talking. Which is the most appropriate treatment for
this individual?
A.  Phenytoin
B.  Oxcarbazepine
C.  Levetiracetam
D.  Phenobarbital
Correct answer = C. Levetiracetam is renally cleared and prone to very few drug interactions. Elderly patients
usually have more comorbidities and take more medications than do younger patients. Oxcarbazepine may cause
hyponatremia, which is more symptomatic in the elderly. Phenytoin and phenobarbital have many drug
interactions and a side effect profile that may be especially troublesome in the elderly age group, including
dizziness that may lead to falls, cognitive issues, and bone health issues.485

I.  Overview
For patients undergoing surgical or medical procedures, different levels of sedation can provide important benefits
to facilitate procedural interventions. These levels of sedation range from anxiolysis to general anesthesia and can
create:
Sedation and reduced anxiety
Lack of awareness and amnesia
Skeletal muscle relaxation
Suppression of undesirable reflexes
Analgesia
Because no single agent provides all desired objectives, several categories of drugs are combined to produce the
optimum level of sedation required (Figure 13.1). Drugs are chosen to provide safe and efficient sedation based on
the type and duration of the procedure and patient characteristics, such as organ function, medical conditions, and
concurrent medications (Figure 13.2). Preoperative medications provide anxiolysis and analgesia and mitigate
unwanted side effects of the anesthetic or the procedure itself. Neuromuscular blockers enable endotracheal
intubation and muscle relaxation to facilitate surgery. Potent general anesthetic medications are delivered via
inhalation and/or intravenously. Except for nitrous oxide, inhaled anesthetics are volatile, halogenated hydrocarbons,
while intravenous (IV) anesthetics consist of several chemically unrelated drug classes commonly used to rapidly
induce and/or maintain a state of general anesthesia.

II.  Levels of Sedation
The levels of sedation occur in a dose-related continuum, which is variable and depends on individual patient
response to various drugs. These “artificial” levels of sedation start with light sedation (anxiolysis) and continue to
moderate sedation, then deep sedation, and finally a state of general anesthesia. The hallmarks of escalation from
one level to the next are recognized by changes in mentation, hemodynamic stability, and respiratory competency
(Figure 13.3). This escalation in levels is often very subtle and unpredictable; therefore, the sedation provider must
always be ready to manage the unanticipated next level of sedation.

III.  Stages of General Anesthesia
General anesthesia is a reversible state of central nervous system (CNS) depression, causing loss of response to and
perception of stimuli. The state of general anesthesia can be divided into three stages: induction, maintenance, and
recovery. Induction is the time from administration of a potent anesthetic to development of unconsciousness, while
maintenance is the sustained period of general anesthesia. Recovery starts with the discontinuation of the anesthetic
and continues until the return of consciousness and protective reflexes. Induction of anesthesia depends on how fast
effective concentrations of anesthetic reach the brain. Recovery is essentially the reverse of induction and depends
on how fast the anesthetic diffuses from the brain. The depth of general anesthesia is the degree to which the CNS is
depressed, as evident in electroencephalograms.
492
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 493 ---

A.  Induction
General anesthesia in adults is normally induced with an IV agent like propofol , producing unconsciousness in 30 to
40 seconds. Often, an IV neuromuscular blocker such as rocuronium, vecuronium, or succinylcholine is
administered to facilitate endotracheal intubation by eliciting muscle relaxation. For children without IV access,
nonpungent volatile agents, such as sevoflurane, are administered via inhalation to induce general anesthesia.
493
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 494 ---

B.  Maintenance of anesthesia
After administering the induction drug, vital signs and response to stimuli are vigilantly monitored to balance the
amount of drug continuously inhaled or infused to maintain general anesthesia. Maintenance is commonly provided
with volatile anesthetics, although total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with drugs like propofol  can be used to
maintain general anesthesia. Opioids such as fentanyl  are used for analgesia along with inhalation agents, because
the latter alter consciousness but not perception of pain.
494
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 495 ---

C.  Recovery
After cessation of the maintenance anesthetic drug, the patient is evaluated for return of consciousness. For most
anesthetic agents, redistribution from the site of action (rather than metabolism of the drug) underlies recovery.
Neuromuscular blocking drugs are typically reversed after completion of surgery, unless enough time has elapsed
for their metabolism. The patient is monitored to assure full recovery of all normal physiologic functions
(spontaneous respiration, blood pressure, heart rate, and all protective reflexes).
495
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 496 ---

IV.  Inhalation Anesthetics
Inhaled gases are used primarily for maintenance of anesthesia after administration of an IV drug (Figure 13.4).
Depth of anesthesia can be rapidly altered by changing the inhaled gas concentration. Inhalational agents have steep
dose–response curves with very narrow therapeutic indices, so the difference in concentrations from eliciting general
anesthesia to cardiopulmonary collapse is small. No antagonists exist. To minimize waste, inhaled gases are
delivered in a recirculation system that contains absorbents to remove carbon dioxide and allow rebreathing of the
gas. Recently, there has been greater attention to the anthropogenic emissions of these potent greenhouse gases,
which are typically released from hospital rooftops after each procedure.
Figure 13.4 Volatile anesthetics delivered to the patient are absorbed via the lungs into
the systemic circulation causing dose-dependent CNS depression.

--- PAGE 497 ---

A.  Common features of inhalation anesthetics
Modern inhalation anesthetics are nonflammable, nonexplosive agents, which include nitrous oxide and volatile,
halogenated hydrocarbons. These agents decrease cerebrovascular resistance, resulting in increased brain perfusion.
They cause bronchodilation but also decrease both respiratory drive and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction
(increased pulmonary vascular resistance in poorly oxygenated regions of the lungs, redirecting blood flow to better
oxygenated regions). Movement of these gases from the lungs to various body compartments depends upon their
solubility in blood and tissues, as well as on blood flow. The following factors play a role in induction and recovery:
497
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 498 ---

B.  Potency
Potency is defined quantitatively as the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC), which is the end-tidal
concentration of inhaled anesthetic needed to eliminate movement in 50% of patients exposed to a noxious stimulus.
MAC is the median effective dose (ED50) of the anesthetic, expressed as the percentage of gas in a mixture required
to achieve that effect. Numerically, MAC is small for potent anesthetics such as isoflurane and large for less potent
agents such as nitrous oxide. Thus, the inverse of MAC is an index of potency ( Figure 13.5). Nitrous oxide alone
cannot produce general anesthesia because any admixture with a survivable oxygen percentage cannot reach its
MAC value. The more lipid soluble an anesthetic, the lower the concentration needed to produce anesthesia and,
therefore, the higher the potency. Factors that can increase MAC (make the patient more resistant) include
hyperthermia, drugs that increase CNS catecholamines, and chronic ethanol abuse. Factors that can decrease MAC
(make the patient more sensitive) include increased age, hypothermia, pregnancy, sepsis, acute intoxication,
concurrent IV anesthetics, and α2-adrenergic receptor agonists (clonidine and dexmedetomidine).
Figure 13.5 Minimal alveolar concentrations (MAC) for anesthetic gases are used to
compare pharmacologic effects of different agents (high MAC = low potency).

--- PAGE 499 ---

C.  Uptake and distribution of inhalation anesthetics
The principal objective of inhalation anesthesia is a constant and optimal brain partial pressure (Pbr) of inhaled
anesthetic (to create a partial pressure equilibrium between alveoli [Palv] and brain [Pbr]). Measuring the Palv is the
most practical and feasible way to ascertain the Pbr for the inhaled anesthetic concentration, but this necessitates
adequate time for the two compartments to reach equilibrium. The partial pressure of an anesthetic gas that
originates by pulmonary entry is the driving force moving the gas from the alveolar space into the bloodstream (Pa),
which transports the drug to the brain and other body compartments. Because gases move from one body
compartment to another according to partial pressure gradients, steady state is achieved when the partial pressure in
each of these compartments is equivalent to that in the inspired mixture. [Note: At equilibrium, Palv = Pa = Pbr.] The
time course for attaining this steady state is determined by the following factors:
1.  Alveolar wash-in
This refers to replacement of normal lung gases with the inspired anesthetic mixture. The time required for this
process is directly proportional to the functional residual capacity of the lung (volume of gas remaining in the lungs
at the end of a normal expiration) and inversely proportional to ventilatory rate. It is independent of the physical
properties of the gas. As the partial pressure builds within the lung, anesthetic gas transfer from the lung begins.
2.  Anesthetic uptake (removal to peripheral tissues other than the brain)
Uptake is the product of the gas solubility in the blood, cardiac output (CO), and gradient between alveolar and
blood anesthetic partial pressures.
a.  Solubility in blood
This is determined by a physical property of the anesthetic called the blood:gas partition coefficient (the ratio of the
concentration of anesthetic in the liquid [blood] phase to the concentration of anesthetic in the gas phase when the
anesthetic is in equilibrium between the two phases; Figure 13.6). For inhaled anesthetics, think of the blood as a
pharmacologically inactive reservoir. Drugs with low versus high blood solubility differ in their rate of induction of
anesthesia. When an anesthetic gas with low blood solubility such as nitrous oxide diffuses from the alveoli into the
circulation, little anesthetic dissolves in the blood. Therefore, equilibrium between the inspired anesthetic and
arterial blood occurs rapidly with relatively few additional molecules of anesthetic required to raise the arterial
anesthetic partial pressure. By contrast, anesthetic gases with high blood solubility, such as isoflurane, dissolve more
fully in the blood; therefore, greater amounts of gas and longer periods of time are required to raise blood partial
pressure. This results in longer periods for induction, recovery, and time to change in depth of anesthesia in response
to changes in the drug concentration. The solubility in blood is ranked as follows: isoflurane > sevoflurane > nitrous
oxide > desflurane.
499

--- PAGE 500 ---

Figure 13.6 Blood/gas partition coefficients for some inhalation anesthetics.
b.  Cardiac output
CO is inversely correlated with induction time for inhaled anesthetics. This counterintuitive phenomenon is
explained by the threshold of drug concentration required to alter neuronal activity and the time neurons are exposed
to the drug in the passing blood. During low CO, a longer period of time permits a larger concentration of gas to
dissolve in the slowly moving bloodstream. Furthermore, this large bolus of drug has longer contact time to diffuse
into neuronal tissue when it traverses the blood–brain barrier. Although a high CO will quickly transport the drug to
the brain, a lower concentration of the drug with a shorter exposure time slows down the rate of induction.
c.  Alveolar-to-venous partial pressure gradient
This gradient between the alveolar and returning venous gas partial pressure results from the tissue uptake from the
arterial delivery. The arterial circulation distributes the anesthetic to various tissues, and tissue uptake is dependent
on the tissue blood flow, blood-to-tissue partial pressure difference, and blood-to-tissue solubility coefficient. As
venous circulation returns to the lung blood with low or no dissolved anesthetic gas, this high gradient causes gas to
move from the alveoli into the blood. If a large alveolar-to-venous partial pressure gradient persists, the peripheral
tissue gas uptake must be high, and therefore, the induction time is longer. Over time, as the partial pressure of gas
in venous blood approximates the inspired mixture and subsequent alveolar concentration, no further uptake from
the lung occurs.
3.  Effect of different tissue types on anesthetic uptake
The time required for a tissue compartment to reach steady state with the partial pressure of the inspired anesthetic
gas is inversely proportional to the blood flow to that tissue (greater flow equals less time to reach equilibrium).
Time to steady state is directly proportional to the capacity of that tissue to store anesthetic (greater storage capacity
equals longer time to reach equilibrium). Furthermore, capacity is directly proportional to the volume of tissue and
the tissue:blood solubility coefficient of the gas. Four major tissue compartments determine the time course of
anesthetic uptake:
a.  Vessel-rich group (brain, heart, liver, kidney, and endocrine glands)
Highly perfused tissues rapidly attain steady state with the partial pressure of anesthetic in the blood.
b.  Skeletal muscles500
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 501 ---

These tissues are moderately perfused with a large storage capacity, which lengthens the time required to achieve
steady state.
c.  Fat
Fat is poorly perfused but has a very large storage capacity for the highly lipophilic volatile anesthetics. This poor
perfusion to a high-capacity compartment drastically prolongs the time required to achieve steady state.
d.  Vessel-poor group (bone, ligaments, and cartilage)
These are very poorly perfused and have a low capacity to store anesthetic gas. Therefore, these tissues have
minimal impact on the time course of anesthetic distribution in the body.
4.  Washout
When an inhalation anesthetic gas is removed from the inspired admixture, the body becomes the repository of
anesthetic gas to be circulated back to the alveolar compartment. The same factors that influence uptake and
equilibrium of the inspired anesthetic determine the time course of its exhalation from the body. Thus, nitrous oxide
exits the body faster than does isoflurane (Figure 13.7).

D.  Mechanism of action
No specific receptor has been identified as the locus to create a state of general anesthesia. The fact that chemically
unrelated compounds produce unconsciousness argues against the existence of a single receptor, and it appears that a
variety of molecular mechanisms may contribute to the activity of anesthetics. At clinically effective concentrations,
general anesthetics increase the sensitivity of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors to the inhibitory
neurotransmitter GABA. This increases chloride ion influx and hyperpolarization of neurons. Postsynaptic neuronal
excitability and, thus, CNS activity are diminished (Figure 13.8). Unlike other anesthetics, nitrous oxide and
ketamine do not have actions on GABAA receptors. Their effects are mediated via inhibition of N -methyl-D-aspartate
(NMDA) receptors. [Note: The NMDA receptor is a glutamate receptor, which is the body’s main excitatory
neurotransmitter.] Receptors other than GABA that are affected by volatile anesthetics include the inhibitory glycine
receptors found in the spinal motor neurons. Additionally, inhalation anesthetics block excitatory postsynaptic
currents found on nicotinic receptors. However, the mechanisms by which anesthetics perform these modulatory
roles are not fully understood.

E.  Isoflurane
Isoflurane [eye-so-FLOOR-ane], like other halogenated gases, produces dose-dependent hypotension predominantly
from relaxation of systemic vasculature. Hypotension can be treated with a direct-acting vasoconstrictor, such as
phenylephrine (see Chapter 6). Because it undergoes little metabolism, isoflurane is considered nontoxic to the liver
and kidney. Its pungent odor stimulates respiratory reflexes (breath holding, salivation, coughing, laryngospasm), so
it is not used for inhalation induction. With a higher blood solubility than desflurane and sevoflurane, isoflurane
takes longer to reach equilibrium, making it less ideal for short procedures; however, its low cost makes it a good
option for longer surgeries.
507
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 508 ---

F.  Desflurane
Desflurane [DES-floor-ane] provides very rapid onset and recovery due to low blood solubility. This makes it a
popular anesthetic for short procedures. It has a low volatility, which requires administration via a special heated
vaporizer. Like isoflurane, it decreases vascular resistance and perfuses all major tissues very well. Desflurane has
significant respiratory irritation like isoflurane so it should not be used for inhalation induction. Its degradation is
minimal and tissue toxicity is rare. Higher cost occasionally prohibits its use.
508
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 509 ---

G.  Sevoflurane
Sevoflurane [see-voe-FLOOR-ane] has low pungency or respiratory irritation. This makes it useful for inhalation
induction, especially with pediatric patients who do not tolerate IV placement. It has a rapid onset and recovery due
to low blood solubility. Sevoflurane has low hepatotoxic potential, but compounds formed from reactions in the
anesthesia circuit (soda lime) may be nephrotoxic with very low fresh gas flow that allows longer chemical reaction
time.
509
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 510 ---

H.  Nitrous oxide
Nitrous oxide [NYE-truss OX-ide] (“laughing gas”) is a nonirritating potent sedative that is unable to create a state
of general anesthesia. It is frequently used at concentrations of 30% to 50% in combination with oxygen to create
moderate sedation, particularly in dentistry. Nitrous oxide does not depress respiration, and maintains cardiovascular
hemodynamics as well as muscular strength. Nitrous oxide can be combined with other inhalational agents to
establish general anesthesia, which lowers the required concentration of the combined volatile agent. This gas
admixture further reduces many unwanted side effects of the other volatile agent that impact cardiovascular output
and cerebral blood flow. Nitrous oxide is poorly soluble in blood and other tissues, allowing it to move very rapidly
in and out of the body. This can be problematic in closed body compartments because nitrous oxide can increase the
volume (exacerbating a pneumothorax) or pressure (sinus or middle ear pressure); it replaces nitrogen in various air
spaces faster than the nitrogen leaves. Its speed of movement allows nitrous oxide to retard oxygen uptake during
recovery, thereby causing “diffusion hypoxia.” This can be overcome by delivering high concentrations of inspired
oxygen during recovery. Some characteristics of the inhalation anesthetics are summarized in Figure 13.9.

I.  Malignant hyperthermia
In a very small percentage of susceptible patients, exposure to halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics (or
succinylcholine) may induce malignant hyperthermia (MH), a rare life-threatening condition. MH causes a drastic
and uncontrolled increase in skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism, overwhelming the body’s capacity to supply
oxygen, remove carbon dioxide, and regulate temperature, eventually leading to circulatory collapse and death if not
treated immediately. Strong evidence indicates that MH is due to an excitation–contraction coupling defect. Burn
victims and individuals with muscular dystrophy, myopathy, myotonia, and osteogenesis imperfecta are susceptible
to MH-like events and caution should be taken. Susceptibility to MH is often inherited as an autosomal dominant
disorder. Should a patient exhibit symptoms of MH, dantrolene is given as the anesthetic mixture is withdrawn, and
measures are taken to rapidly cool the patient. Dantrolene [DAN-troe-leen] blocks release of Ca2+ from the
sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle cells, reducing heat production and relaxing muscle tone. It should be available
whenever triggering agents are administered. In addition, the patient must be monitored and supported for
respiratory, circulatory, and renal problems. Use of dantrolene and avoidance of triggering agents such as
halogenated anesthetics in susceptible individuals have markedly reduced mortality from MH. A more soluble
formulation of dantrolene has become commercially available that drastically reduces the constitution time needed
to make this drug in emergencies.

V.  Intravenous Anesthetics
IV anesthetics cause rapid induction of anesthesia often occurring in 1 minute or less. It is the most common way to
induce anesthesia before maintenance of anesthesia with an inhalation agent. IV anesthetics may be used as single
agents for short procedures or administered as infusions (TIVA) to help maintain anesthesia during longer surgeries.
In lower doses, they may be used solely for sedation.
513
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 514 ---

A.  Induction
After entering the blood, a percentage of drug binds to plasma proteins, and the rest remains unbound or “free.” The
degree of protein binding depends upon the physical characteristics of the drug, such as the degree of ionization and
lipid solubility. The majority of CO flows to the brain, liver, and kidney (“vessel-rich organs”). Thus, a high
proportion of initial drug bolus is delivered to the cerebral circulation and then passes along a concentration gradient
from blood into the brain. The rate of this transfer is dependent on the arterial concentration of the unbound free
drug, the lipid solubility of the drug, and the degree of ionization. Unbound, lipid-soluble, nonionized molecules
cross into the brain most quickly. Like inhalational anesthetics, the exact mode of action of IV anesthetics is
unknown; however, GABA likely plays a large role.
514
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 515 ---

B.  Recovery
Recovery from IV anesthetics is due to redistribution from the CNS. After initial flooding of the CNS and other
vessel-rich tissues with nonionized molecules, the drug diffuses into other tissues with less blood supply. With
secondary tissue uptake, predominantly skeletal muscle, plasma concentration of the drug falls. This allows the drug
to diffuse out of the CNS, down the resulting reverse concentration gradient. This initial redistribution of drug into
other tissues leads to the rapid recovery seen after a single IV dose of induction agent. Metabolism and plasma
clearance become important only following infusions and repeat doses of a drug. Adipose tissue makes little
contribution to the early redistribution of free drug following a bolus, due to its poor blood supply. However,
following repeat doses or infusions, equilibration with fat tissue forms a drug reservoir, often leading to delayed
recovery.
515

--- PAGE 516 ---

C.  Effect of reduced cardiac output on IV anesthetics
When CO is reduced (for example, in certain types of shock, the elderly, cardiac disease), the body compensates by
diverting more CO to the cerebral circulation. A greater proportion of the IV anesthetic enters the cerebral
circulation under these circumstances. Therefore, the dose of the drug must be reduced. Further, decreased CO
causes prolonged circulation time. As global CO is reduced, it takes a longer time for an induction drug to reach the
brain and exert its effects. The slow titration of a reduced dose of an IV anesthetic is key to a safe induction in
patients with reduced CO.

--- PAGE 517 ---

D.  Propofol
Propofol  [PRO-puh-fol] is an IV sedative/hypnotic used for induction and/or maintenance of anesthesia. It is widely
used and has replaced thiopental  as the first choice for induction of general anesthesia and sedation. Because
propofol  is poorly water soluble, it is supplied as an emulsion containing soybean oil and egg phospholipid, giving it
a milklike appearance.
1.  Onset
Induction is smooth and occurs 30 to 40 seconds after administration. Plasma levels decline rapidly as a result of
redistribution, followed by a more prolonged period of hepatic metabolism and renal clearance. The initial
redistribution half-life is 2 to 4 minutes. The pharmacokinetics of propofol  are not altered by moderate hepatic or
renal failure.
2.  Actions
Although propofol  depresses the CNS, it occasionally contributes to excitatory phenomena, such as muscle
twitching, spontaneous movement, yawning, and hiccups. Transient pain at the injection site is common. Propofol
decreases blood pressure without significantly depressing the myocardium. It also reduces intracranial pressure,
mainly due to decreased cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption. It has less of a depressant effect than volatile
anesthetics on CNS-evoked potentials, making it useful for surgeries in which spinal cord function is monitored. It
does not provide analgesia, so supplementation with narcotics is required. Propofol  is commonly infused in lower
doses to provide sedation. The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is very low secondary to its
antiemetic properties.

--- PAGE 518 ---

E.  Barbiturates
Thiopental  [THYE-oh-PEN-tahl] is an ultra–short-acting barbiturate with high lipid solubility. It is a potent
anesthetic but a weak analgesic. Barbiturates require supplementary analgesic administration during anesthesia.
When given IV, agents such as thiopental  and methohexital  [meth-oh-HEX-uh-tall] quickly enter the CNS and
depress function, often in less than 1 minute. However, diffusion out of the brain can also occur very rapidly
because of redistribution to other tissues (Figure 13.10). These drugs may remain in the body for relatively long
periods, because only about 15% of a dose entering the circulation is metabolized by the liver per hour. Thus,
metabolism of thiopental  is much slower than its redistribution. Barbiturates tend to decrease blood pressure, which
may cause a reflex tachycardia. They decrease intracranial pressure through reductions in cerebral blood flow and
oxygen consumption. Thiopental  is no longer available in many countries, including the United States. Methohexital
is still commonly used for electroconvulsive therapy.
Figure 13.10 Redistribution of thiopental from the brain to muscle and adipose tissue.

--- PAGE 519 ---

F.  Benzodiazepines
The benzodiazepines are used in conjunction with anesthetics for sedation and amnesia. The most commonly used is
midazolam [meh-DAZ-o-lam]. Diazepam [dye-AZ-uh-pam] and lorazepam [lore-AZ-uh-pam] are alternatives. All
three facilitate amnesia while causing sedation, enhancing the inhibitory effects of various neurotransmitters,
particularly GABA. Minimal cardiovascular depressant effects are seen, but all are potential respiratory depressants
(especially when administered IV). They are metabolized by the liver with variable elimination half-lives, and
erythromycin may prolong effects of midazolam. Benzodiazepines can induce a temporary form of anterograde
amnesia in which the patient retains memory of past events, but new information is not transferred into long-term
memory. Therefore, important treatment information should be repeated to the patient after the effects of the drug
have worn off.

--- PAGE 520 ---

G.  Opioids
Because of their analgesic property, opioids are commonly combined with other anesthetics. The choice of opioid is
based primarily on the duration of action needed. The most commonly used opioids are fentanyl  [FEN-ta-nil] and its
congeners, sufentanil  [SOO-fen-ta-nil] and remifentanil  [REMI-fen-ta-nil], because they induce analgesia more
rapidly than morphine. They may be administered intravenously, epidurally, or intrathecally (into the cerebrospinal
fluid). Opioids are not good amnestics, and they can all cause hypotension and respiratory depression, as well as
nausea and vomiting. Opioid effects can be antagonized by naloxone.

H.  Etomidate
Etomidate [ee-TOM-uh-date] is a hypnotic agent used to induce anesthesia, but it lacks analgesic activity. Its water
solubility is poor, so it is formulated in a propylene glycol solution. Induction is rapid, and the drug is short-acting.
Among its benefits are little to no effect on the heart and systemic vascular resistance. Etomidate is usually only
used for patients with cardiovascular dysfunction or patients who are acutely critically ill. It inhibits 11-β
hydroxylase involved in steroidogenesis, and adverse effects may include decreased plasma cortisol and aldosterone
levels. Etomidate should not be infused for an extended time, because prolonged suppression of these hormones is
dangerous. Injection site pain, involuntary skeletal muscle movements, and nausea and vomiting are common.

I.  Ketamine
Ketamine [KET-uh-meen], a short-acting anti-NMDA receptor anesthetic and analgesic, induces a dissociated state
in which the patient is unconscious (but may appear to be awake) with profound analgesia. Ketamine stimulates
central sympathetic outflow, causing stimulation of the heart with increased blood pressure and CO. It is also a
potent bronchodilator. Therefore, it is beneficial in patients with hypovolemic or cardiogenic shock as well as
asthmatics. Conversely, it is contraindicated in hypertensive or stroke patients. The drug is lipophilic and enters the
brain very quickly. Like the barbiturates, it redistributes to other organs and tissues. Ketamine has become popular
as an adjunct to reduce opioid consumption during surgery. Of note, it may induce hallucinations, particularly in
young adults, but pretreatment with benzodiazepines may help. Ketamine may be used illicitly, since it causes a
dreamlike state and hallucinations similar to phencyclidine (PCP).

J.  Dexmedetomidine
Dexmedetomidine [dex-med-eh-TOM-uh-deen] is a sedative used in intensive care settings and surgery. Like
clonidine, it is an α2 receptor agonist in certain parts of the brain. Dexmedetomidine has sedative, analgesic,
sympatholytic, and anxiolytic effects that blunt many cardiovascular responses. It reduces volatile anesthetic,
sedative, and analgesic requirements without causing significant respiratory depression. It has gained popularity for
its ability to blunt emergence delirium in the pediatric population. Some therapeutic advantages and disadvantages
of the anesthetic agents are summarized in Figure 13.11.

VI.  Neuromuscular Blockers
Neuromuscular blockers are crucial to the practice of anesthesia and used to facilitate endotracheal intubation and
provide muscle relaxation when needed for surgery. Their mechanism of action is via blockade of nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors on the skeletal muscle cell membrane. These agents include cisatracurium, mivacurium,
pancuronium, rocuronium, succinylcholine, and vecuronium (see Chapter 5).
524

--- PAGE 525 ---

A.  Sugammadex
Sugammadex [soo-GAM-ma-dex] is a selective relaxant-binding agent that terminates the action of both rocuronium
and vecuronium. Its three-dimensional structure traps the neuromuscular blocker in a 1:1 ratio, terminating its action
and making it water soluble. It is unique in that it produces rapid and effective reversal of both shallow and profound
neuromuscular blockade. Sugammadex is eliminated via the kidneys.

VII.  Local Anesthetics
Local anesthetics block nerve conduction of sensory impulses and in higher concentrations block motor impulses
from the periphery to the CNS. Sodium ion channels are blocked to prevent the transient increase in permeability of
the nerve membrane to Na+ that is required for an action potential (Figure 13.12). When propagation of action
potentials is prevented, sensation cannot be transmitted from the source of stimulation to the brain. Delivery
techniques include topical administration, infiltration, and perineural and neuraxial (spinal, epidural, or caudal)
blocks. Small, unmyelinated nerve fibers for pain, temperature, and autonomic activity are most sensitive.
Structurally, local anesthetics all include a lipophilic group joined by an amide or ester linkage to a carbon chain,
which, in turn, is joined to a hydrophilic group (Figure 13.13). The most widely used local anesthetics are
bupivacaine [byoo-PIV-uh-cane], lidocaine [LYE-doe-cane], mepivacaine [muh-PIV-uh-cane], ropivacaine [roe-
PIV-uh-cane], and tetracaine [TET-truh-cane].

--- PAGE 528 ---

A.  Actions
Local anesthetics cause vasodilation, which leads to a rapid diffusion away from the site of action and short duration
when these drugs are administered alone. By adding the vasoconstrictor epinephrine, the rate of local anesthetic
absorption and diffusion is decreased. This minimizes systemic toxicity and increases the duration of action. Hepatic
function does not affect the duration of action of local anesthesia because that is determined by redistribution rather
than biotransformation. Some local anesthetics have other therapeutic uses (for example, lidocaine is an IV
antiarrhythmic).
528
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 529 ---

B.  Onset, potency, and duration of action
The onset of action of local anesthetics is influenced by several factors including tissue pH, nerve morphology,
concentration, pKa, and lipid solubility of the drug. Of these, the pKa is most important. Local anesthetics with a
lower pKa have a quicker onset, since more drug exists in the unionized form at physiologic pH, thereby allowing
penetration of the nerve cell membrane. Once at the nerve membrane, the ionized form interacts with the protein
receptor of the Na+ channel to inhibit its function and achieve local anesthesia. The pH may drop in infected sites,
causing onset to be delayed or even prevented. Potency and duration of these agents depend mainly on lipid
solubility, with higher solubility correlating with increased potency and duration of action.
529

--- PAGE 530 ---

C.  Metabolism
Biotransformation of amides occurs primarily in the liver. Prilocaine [PRY-low-cane], a dental anesthetic, is also
metabolized in the plasma and kidney, and one of its metabolites may lead to methemoglobinemia. Esters are
biotransformed by plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase). Patients with pseudocholinesterase deficiency may
metabolize ester local anesthetics more slowly. At normal doses, this has little clinical effect. Reduced hepatic
function predisposes patients to toxic effects, but should not significantly increase the duration of action of local
anesthetics.
530
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 531 ---

D.  Allergic reactions
Patient reports of allergic reactions to local anesthetics are fairly common, but often times, reported “allergies” are
actually side effects from the coadministered epinephrine. True allergy to an amide local anesthetic is exceedingly
rare, while the ester procaine is more allergenic and has largely been removed from the market. Allergy to one ester
rules out use of another ester, because the allergenic component is the metabolite para-aminobenzoic acid, produced
by all esters. By contrast, allergy to one amide does not rule out the use of another amide. A patient may be allergic
to other compounds in the local anesthetic, such as preservatives in multidose vials.
531

--- PAGE 532 ---

E.  Local anesthetic systemic toxicity
Toxic blood levels of a local anesthetic may be due to repeated injections or could result from a single inadvertent
IV injection. Each drug has a weight-based toxic threshold that should be calculated. This is especially important in
children, the elderly, and women in labor (who are more susceptible to local anesthetics). Aspiration before every
injection is imperative. The signs, symptoms, and timing of local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) are
unpredictable. One must consider the diagnosis in any patient with altered mental status, seizures, or cardiovascular
instability following injection of local anesthetic. Treatment for LAST may include seizure suppression, airway
management, and cardiopulmonary support. Administering a 20% lipid emulsion infusion (lipid rescue therapy) is a
valuable asset. Figure 13.14 summarizes pharmacologic properties of some local anesthetics.

VIII.  Anesthetic Adjuncts
Adjuncts are a critical part of the practice of anesthesia and include drugs that affect gastrointestinal (GI) motility,
PONV, anxiety, and analgesia. Adjuncts are used in collaboration to help make the anesthetic experience safe and
pleasant.
533
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 534 ---

A.  Gastrointestinal medications
H2-receptor antagonists (for example, ranitidine; see Chapter 40) and proton pump inhibitors (for example,
omeprazole; see Chapter 40) help to reduce gastric acidity in the event of an aspiration. Nonparticulate antacids
(sodium citrate/ citric acid) are given occasionally to quickly increase the pH of stomach contents. These drugs are
used in the obstetric population going to surgery, along with other patients with reflux. Finally, a dopamine receptor
antagonist (metoclopramide) can be used as a prokinetic agent to speed gastric emptying and increase lower
esophageal sphincter tone.
534
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 535 ---

B.  Medications for PONV
PONV can be a significant problem during and after surgery both for the clinician and the patient. Risk factors for
PONV include female gender, nonsmoker, use of volatile and nitrous anesthetics, duration of surgery, and
postoperative narcotic use. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (for example, ondansetron; see Chapter 40) are commonly
used to prevent PONV and are usually administered toward the end of surgery. Caution is advised in patients with
long QT intervals on electrocardiogram (ECG). An anticholinergic and antihistamine (promethazine) can also be
used; however, sedation, delirium, and confusion can complicate the postoperative period, especially in the elderly.
Glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone can be used to reduce PONV. The mechanism is unclear, but because of a
longer onset, these agents are usually given at the start of surgery. The neurokinin-1 antagonist aprepitant  has also
been shown to reduce PONV. Lastly, transdermal scopolamine is given preoperatively to patients with multiple risk
factors or a history of PONV. Caution is advised because it can produce central anticholinergic effects.
535

--- PAGE 536 ---

C.  Anxiety medications
Anxiety is a common part of the surgical experience. Benzodiazepines (midazolam, diazepam), α2 agonists
(clonidine, dexmedetomidine), and H1-receptor antagonists (diphenhydramine) can be used to alleviate anxiety.
Benzodiazepines also elicit anterograde amnesia, which can help promote a more pleasant surgical experience.
536
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 537 ---

D.  Analgesia
While opioids are a mainstay in anesthesia for pain control, multimodal analgesia is becoming more common due to
the long-term risks of opioid consumption in surgical patients. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( ketorolac,
celecoxib; see Chapter 38) are common adjuncts to opioids. Caution should be used in patients with coagulopathies,
and in those with a history of peptic ulcer or platelet aggregation abnormalities. Acetaminophen can be used both PO
and IV, but caution is advised in impaired hepatic function. Analogs of GABA (gabapentin, pregabalin; see Chapter
12) are becoming more common as pretreatment to reduce opioid consumption both during and after surgery. They
also have multiple uses in neuropathic pain and addiction medicine. The NMDA antagonist ketamine is used to
reduce overall opioid consumption both intra- and postoperatively. Actions of anesthesia adjunct drugs are shown in
Figure 13.15.

Choose the ONE best answer.
Regarding levels of sedation, which one applies to loss of perception and sensation to painful stimuli?
A.  Anxiolysis
B.  General anesthesia
C.  Moderate sedation
D.  Deep sedation
Correct answer = B. Anxiolysis is a state of relaxation, but consciousness remains. General anesthesia is a total
loss of perception and sensation to stimuli. Moderate sedation maintains mentation with adequate airway and
respiratory competency. Deep sedation has some response to stimuli, but respirations may be inadequate.
Which of the following decreases minimum alveolar concentration (MAC)?
A.  Hyperthermia
B.  Cocaine intoxication
C.  Pregnancy
D.  Chronic ethanol abuse
Correct answer = C. Pregnancy is the only choice that decreases minimum alveolar concentration. All the other
options increase MAC.
Which of the following determines the speed of recovery from intravenous anesthetics used for induction?
A.  Liver metabolism of the drug
B.  Protein binding of the drug
C.  Ionization of the drug
D.  Redistribution of the drug from sites in the CNS
Correct answer = D. Following initial flooding of the CNS with nonionized molecules, the drug diffuses into
other tissues. With secondary tissue uptake, the plasma concentration falls, allowing the drug to diffuse out of the
CNS. This initial redistribution of drug into other tissues leads to the rapid recovery seen after a single dose of an
IV induction drug. Protein binding, ionization, and lipid solubility affect the rate of transfer.
Which one of the following is a potent intravenous anesthetic and analgesic?
A.  Propofol
B.  Midazolam
C.  Ketamine
D.  Fentanyl
Correct answer = C. Ketamine is unique in its blockage of NMDA receptors, yielding both potent anesthetic and
analgesic properties. Propofol is a potent anesthetic but a weak analgesic. Benzodiazepines such as midazolam
have little analgesic effect, but can be a potent anesthetic at high doses. Fentanyl is a potent analgesic.
Which local anesthetic is metabolized by plasma cholinesterase?
A.  Tetracaine
B.  Bupivacaine
C.  Lidocaine
D.  Ropivacaine
Correct answer = A. Tetracaine is the only ester type local anesthetic of the choices. The other choices are amide-
type local anesthetics, which are metabolized by biotransformation in the liver. Remember that esters usually
have one “i” in the spelling, where amides typically have two “i”’s.
A 23-year-old patient with a history of severe postoperative nausea and vomiting is coming in for plastic
surgery. Which anesthetic drug would be best to use for maintenance in this situation?
A.  Isoflurane
B.  Sevoflurane
C.  Nitrous oxide
D.  Propofol
Correct answer = D. A propofol infusion (TIVA) anesthetic would be best for this patient with a history of
postoperative nausea and vomiting. Propofol is the only anesthetic listed with antiemetic properties. Both
fluorinated hydrocarbons (isoflurane and sevoflurane) and nitrous oxide are linked to nausea and vomiting during
surgery.

13.10undergo emergent coronary artery bypass surgery. Which of the following would you expect in this patient?
A.  Faster induction time with IV anesthetics
B.  Need for increased dosage of IV anesthetics
C.  Faster induction time with inhaled anesthetics
D.  Enhanced removal of inhaled anesthetics to peripheral tissues
Correct answer = C. For inhaled anesthetics during low CO, a longer period of time permits a larger concentration
of gas to dissolve in the slowly moving bloodstream. Furthermore, this large bolus of drug has longer contact time
to diffuse into neuronal tissue when it traverses the blood–brain barrier, yielding a faster induction time. The dose
of an IV drug must be reduced (not increased). In addition, with reduced cardiac output, it takes a longer time for
an IV induction drug to reach the brain, resulting in a slower induction time.
A 70-year-old patient in the intensive care unit needs sedation due to prolonged endotracheal intubation.
Which of the following medications should be avoided for sedation in this patient?
A.  Fentanyl
B.  Etomidate
C.  Propofol
D.  Dexmedetomidine
Correct answer = B. Adverse effects of etomidate include decreased plasma cortisol and aldosterone levels by
inhibiting the 11-β hydroxylase enzyme. Etomidate should not be infused for an extended time, because
prolonged suppression of these hormones is dangerous. All of the other choices could be used for sedation in the
ICU setting.
A 35-year-old man presents with appendicitis and requires a surgical intervention. He has a family history of
malignant hyperthermia. Which anesthetic agent is most appropriate to use in this patient?
A.  Isoflurane
B.  Propofol
C.  Succinylcholine
D.  Sevoflurane
Correct answer = B. Propofol is the only medication listed that is safe in patients susceptible to malignant
hyperthermia. All fluorinated hydrocarbons (isoflurane, sevoflurane, desflurane) as well as succinylcholine are
contraindicated and considered triggering agents. Flushing of the anesthesia machine, removal of vaporizers, use
of special filters, and availability of dantrolene are highly advised.
A 32-year-old woman presents for a right distal radius fracture. She requests regional anesthesia to help with
her pain postoperatively. She reports that as a child, she had an allergic reaction to Novocain (procaine) at
the dentist’s office. Which local anesthetic is appropriate for use in this patient?
A.  Chloroprocaine
B.  Benzocaine
C.  Ropivacaine
D.  Tetracaine
Correct answer = C. Procaine is an ester local anesthetic. Since this patient has an allergy to procaine, other ester
anesthetics (chloroprocaine, tetracaine, benzocaine) should not be used. Benzocaine is mostly used as a topical
product for temporary relief of dental or oral pain. Ropivacaine is an amide local anesthetic commonly used in
regional anesthesia to facilitate peripheral nerve blockade.541

I.  Overview
Management of pain is one of clinical medicine’s greatest challenges. Pain is defined as an unpleasant sensation that
can be either acute or chronic and is a consequence of complex neurochemical processes in the peripheral and
central nervous systems (CNS). It is subjective, and the clinician must rely on the patient’s perception and
description of pain. Alleviation of pain depends on the specific type of pain (nociceptive or neuropathic pain). For
example, with mild to moderate arthritic pain (nociceptive pain), nonopioid analgesics such as nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; see Chapter 38) are often effective. Neuropathic pain responds best to
anticonvulsants, tricyclic antidepressants, or serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. However, for severe acute
pain or chronic malignant or nonmalignant pain, opioids can be considered as part of the treatment plan in select
patients (Figure 14.1). Opioids are natural, semisynthetic, or synthetic compounds that produce morphine-like
effects (Figure 14.2). These agents are divided into chemical classes based on their chemical structure (Figure 14.3).
All opioids act by binding to specific opioid receptors in the CNS to produce effects that mimic the action of
endogenous peptide neurotransmitters (for example, endorphins, enkephalins, and dynorphins). Although the opioids
have a broad range of effects, their primary use is to relieve intense pain that results from surgery, injury, or chronic
disease. Unfortunately, widespread availability of opioids has led to abuse of agents with euphoric properties.
Antagonists that reverse the actions of opioids are also clinically important for use in cases of overdose (Figure
14.1).

--- PAGE 548 ---

II.  Opioid Receptors
The major effects of the opioids are mediated by three main receptor families, commonly designated as μ (mu,
MOR), κ (kappa, KOR), and δ (delta, DOR). Each receptor family exhibits a different specificity for the drug(s) it
binds. The analgesic properties of the opioids are primarily mediated by the mu receptors that modulate responses to
thermal, mechanical, and chemical nociception. The κ receptors in the dorsal horn also contribute to analgesia by
modulating the response to chemical and thermal nociception. The enkephalins interact more selectively with δ
receptors in the periphery. All three opioid receptors are members of the G protein–coupled receptor family and
inhibit adenylyl cyclase. They are also associated with ion channels, increasing postsynaptic K+ efflux
(hyperpolarization) or reducing presynaptic Ca2+ influx, thus impeding neuronal firing and transmitter release in the
spinal dorsal horn (Figure 14.4).

III.  Opioid Agonists
Morphine [MOR-feen] is the prototypical strong μ receptor agonist. Codeine [KOE-deen] is inherently less potent
and the prototype of the weak μ opioid agonists. Currently available opioids have many differences, such as receptor
affinity, pharmacokinetic profiles, available routes of administration, and adverse effect profiles. Some opioids are
also available in abuse deterrent formulations. Comparing other available opioids to morphine is helpful in
identifying the unique differences to guide the selection of a safe and effective pain management regimen (Figure
14.5).
Figure 14.5 Summary of clinically relevant properties for selected opioids.
551
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 552 ---

A.  Morphine
1.  Mechanism of action
Morphine and other opioids exert analgesic effects by interacting stereospecifically with opioid receptors on the
membranes of neuronal cells in the CNS and other anatomic structures, such as the smooth muscles of the
gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the urinary bladder. Morphine is somewhat selective to the μ opioid receptor but has
some affinity for the κ and δ receptors. Morphine also inhibits the release of many excitatory transmitters from nerve
terminals carrying nociceptive (painful) stimuli. Some therapeutic uses of morphine and other opioids are listed in
Figure 14.6.
Figure 14.6 Selected clinical uses of opioids.
2.  Actions
a.  Analgesia
Morphine and other opioids relieve pain by raising the pain threshold at the spinal cord level and by altering the
brain’s perception of pain. The maximum analgesic efficacy for representative opioid agonists is shown in Figure
14.7.
552
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 553 ---

Figure 14.7 A comparison of opioid agonist efficacy.
b.  Euphoria
Morphine produces a powerful sense of contentment and well-being. Euphoria may be caused by disinhibition of the
dopamine-containing neurons of the ventral tegmental area.
c.  Respiration
Morphine causes respiratory depression by reduction of the responsiveness of medullary respiratory center neurons
to carbon dioxide. This can occur with ordinary doses of morphine in patients who are opioid naïve and can be
accentuated as the dose is increased, until ultimately respiration ceases. Respiratory depression is the most common
cause of death in acute opioid overdoses. Tolerance to this effect develops with repeated dosing, which allows for
the safer use of morphine for the treatment of pain when the dose is correctly titrated.
d.  Depression of cough reflex
Both morphine and codeine have antitussive properties. In general, cough suppression does not correlate closely
with analgesic and respiratory depressant properties of opioid drugs. The receptors involved in the antitussive action
appear to be different from those involved in analgesia.
e.  Miosis
The pinpoint pupil (Figure 14.8) characteristic of morphine use results from stimulation of μ and κ receptors. There
is little tolerance to this effect. [Note: This is important diagnostically, because many other causes of coma and
respiratory depression produce dilation of the pupil.]
553
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 554 ---

Figure 14.8 Characteristic pinpoint pupil associated with morphine use.
f.  Emesis
Morphine directly stimulates the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the area postrema that causes vomiting.
g.  GI tract
Morphine relieves diarrhea by decreasing the motility and increasing the tone of the intestinal circular smooth
muscle. Morphine also increases the tone of the anal sphincter. Morphine and other opioids produce constipation,
with little tolerance developing. Morphine can also increase biliary tract pressure due to contraction of the
gallbladder and constriction of the biliary sphincter.
h.  Cardiovascular
Morphine has no major effects on blood pressure or heart rate at lower dosages, but hypotension and bradycardia
may occur at higher doses. Because of respiratory depression and carbon dioxide retention, cerebral vessels dilate
and increase cerebrospinal fluid pressure. Morphine is usually contraindicated in individuals with head trauma or
severe brain injury.
i.  Histamine release
Morphine releases histamine from mast cells causing urticaria, sweating, and vasodilation. Because it can cause
bronchoconstriction, morphine should be used with caution in patients with asthma.
j.  Hormonal actions
Prolonged use of morphine may lead to opioid-induced androgen deficiency due to suppression of the
hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPA). This results in decreased production of sex hormones, especially
testosterone, resulting in many clinical symptoms (Figure 14.9).

--- PAGE 556 ---

Figure 14.9 Clinical symptoms associated with opioid-induced androgen deficiency
(OPIAD).
k.  Labor
Morphine may prolong the second stage of labor by transiently decreasing the strength, duration, and frequency of
uterine contractions.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
a.  Administration
Morphine has a linear pharmacokinetic profile; however, absorption of morphine after oral administration is slow
and erratic. Extended-release oral preparations provide more consistent plasma levels. Because significant first-pass
metabolism of morphine occurs in the liver, subcutaneous and intravenous (IV) injections produce the most reliable
response.
b.  Distribution
Morphine rapidly enters all body tissues, including the fetuses of pregnant women. It should not be used for
analgesia during labor. Infants born to addicted mothers show physical dependence on opioids and exhibit
withdrawal symptoms if opioids are not administered. Only a small percentage of morphine crosses the blood–brain
barrier, because morphine is the least lipophilic of the common opioids. By contrast, the more lipid-soluble opioids,
such as fentanyl  and methadone, readily penetrate the CNS.
c.  Fate
Morphine is conjugated with glucuronic acid in the liver to two active metabolites (morphine-6-glucuronide [M6G]
and morphine-3-glucuronide [M3G]), which are renally excreted. M6G is a very potent analgesic. M3G does not
have analgesic activity but is believed to cause neuroexcitatory effects. The duration of action of morphine is 4 to 5
hours when administered systemically to opioid-naïve individuals but considerably longer when injected epidurally
because the low lipophilicity prevents redistribution from the epidural space.
4.  Adverse effects
Many adverse effects are common across the entire opioid class (Figure 14.10). With most mu agonists, severe
respiratory depression can occur and may result in death from acute opioid overdose. Respiratory drive may be
suppressed in patients with respiratory disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea, emphysema, or cor pulmonale, so
close monitoring is necessary when using opioids. Opioid-induced constipation (OIC) is a common adverse effect.
Initial management includes a nonprescription stimulant laxative such as senna. Peripherally acting μ-opioid
receptor antagonists such as methylnaltrexone, naloxegol , and naldemedine are prescription drugs available for the
treatment of OIC. [Note: Lubiprostone is a chloride channel activator that is indicated for OIC and irritable bowel
syndrome; see Chapter 40.] Morphine should be used with caution in patients with liver disease and renal
dysfunction.

Figure 14.10 Adverse effects commonly observed in individuals treated with opioids.
5.  Tolerance and physical dependence
Repeated use produces tolerance to the respiratory depressant, analgesic, euphoric, emetic, and sedative effects of
morphine. Tolerance usually does not develop to miosis (constriction of the pupils) or constipation. Physical and
psychological dependence can occur with morphine and other agonists. Withdrawal produces a series of autonomic,
motor, and psychological responses that can be severe, although it is rare that withdrawal effects cause death.
6.  Drug interactions
Drug interactions with morphine are possible. The depressant actions of morphine are enhanced by coadministration
with CNS depressant medications such as phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and
benzodiazepines. Guidelines for opioid prescribing urge clinicians to avoid simultaneous prescribing of opioids and
benzodiazepines. A black box warning also has been included on the labeling of both opioids and benzodiazepines
to alert prescribers of this dangerous combination.

B.  Codeine
Codeine [KOE-deen] is a naturally occurring opioid and a weak analgesic compared to morphine. It is used for mild
to moderate pain. The analgesic actions of codeine are derived from its conversion to morphine by the CYP2D6
enzyme (see Chapter 1). CYP2D6 activity varies among patients, and ultrarapid metabolizers may experience higher
levels of morphine, leading to possible overdose and toxicity. Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have
been reported in children who received codeine, mostly following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. Codeine is
commonly used in combination with acetaminophen for management of pain. The drug exhibits good antitussive
activity at doses that do not cause analgesia. Dextromethorphan [dex-troe-meth-OR-fan] is a synthetic cough
depressant that has relatively no analgesic action and much lower potential for abuse in usual antitussive doses. It is
preferred over codeine in most situations where cough suppression is needed.

C.  Oxycodone and oxymorphone
Oxymorphone [ox-ee-MOR-fone] and oxycodone [ok-see-KOE-done] are orally active, semisynthetic analogs of
morphine and codeine, respectively. Oxymorphone given parenterally is approximately ten times more potent than
morphine, but when administered orally, the potency drops to about three times that of morphine. Oxymorphone is
available in both immediate-release and extended-release oral formulations. This agent has no clinically relevant
drug interactions associated with the CYP450 enzyme system. Oxycodone is approximately two times more potent
than morphine and is available in an immediate-release formulation, alone or in combination with acetaminophen,
aspirin, or ibuprofen. An extended-release formulation is also available. Oxycodone is mainly metabolized via the
CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes.

D.  Hydromorphone and hydrocodone
Hydromorphone [hye-droe-MORE-fone] and hydrocodone [hye-droe-KOE-done] are orally active, semisynthetic
analogs of morphine and codeine, respectively. Oral hydromorphone is approximately 4 to 7 times more potent than
oral morphine. It is preferred over morphine in patients with renal dysfunction due to less accumulation of active
metabolites. Hydrocodone is the methyl ether derivative of hydromorphone, but is a weaker analgesic than
hydromorphone, with oral analgesic efficacy comparable to that of morphine. This agent is often combined with
acetaminophen or ibuprofen to treat moderate to severe pain. It is also used as an antitussive. Hydrocodone is
metabolized in the liver to several metabolites, one of which is hydromorphone via the actions of CYP2D6.

E.  Fentanyl
Fentanyl  [FEN-ta-nil] is a synthetic opioid chemically related to meperidine. Fentanyl  has 100-fold the analgesic
potency of morphine and is used for anesthesia and acute pain management. The drug is highly lipophilic and has a
rapid onset and short duration of action (15 to 30 minutes). It is usually administered IV, epidurally, or intrathecally.
Fentanyl  is combined with local anesthetics to provide epidural analgesia for labor and postoperative pain. IV
fentanyl  is used in anesthesia for its analgesic and sedative effects. Many fast-acting transmucosal and nasal fentanyl
products are available for cancer-related breakthrough pain in opioid-tolerant patients. The transdermal patch creates
a reservoir of the drug in the skin and has a delayed onset of at least 12 hours and a prolonged offset. The patch is
used for management of chronic severe pain. It is contraindicated in opioid-naïve patients and should not be used in
management of acute or postoperative pain. Fentanyl  is metabolized to inactive metabolites by CYP3A4, and drugs
that inhibit this isoenzyme can potentiate the effect of fentanyl .

F.  Sufentanil, alfentanil, remifentanil, and carfentanil
Sufentanil  [soo-FEN-ta-nil], alfentanil  [al-FEN-ta-nil], remifentanil  [rem-ih-FEN-ta-nil], and carfentanil  [car-FEN-
ta-nil] are synthetic opioid agonists related to fentanyl . These agents differ in potency and metabolic disposition.
Sufentanil  and carfentanil  are even more potent than fentanyl , whereas the other two are less potent and shorter
acting. Sufentanil , alfentanil , and remifentanil  are mainly used for their analgesic and sedative properties during
surgical procedures requiring anesthesia. Carfentanil  is about 100 times more potent than fentanyl . The drug is not
used in clinical practice; however, it is of toxicological interest as it is used to lace heroin and has contributed to
several opioid-related deaths.

--- PAGE 564 ---

G.  Methadone
Methadone [METH-a-done] is a synthetic, orally effective opioid that has variable equianalgesic potency compared
to that of morphine, and the conversion between the two products is not linear. Methadone is a μ agonist, an
antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, and a norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
Therefore, it is useful in the treatment of both nociceptive and neuropathic pain. Methadone may also be used for
opioid withdrawal and maintenance therapy in the setting of prescription opioid and heroin abuse. The withdrawal
syndrome with methadone is milder but more protracted (days to weeks) than that with other opioids. Methadone
induces less euphoria and has a longer duration of action than morphine. Unlike morphine, methadone is well
absorbed after oral administration. Methadone is also constipating, but less so than morphine.
Understanding the pharmacokinetics of methadone is important to ensure proper use. After oral administration,
methadone is biotransformed in the liver and excreted almost exclusively in the feces. Methadone is very lipophilic,
rapidly distributed throughout the body, and released slowly during redistribution and elimination. This translates
into a long half-life ranging from 12 to 40 hours, although it may extend up to 150 hours. Despite the extended half-
life, the actual duration of analgesia ranges from 4 to 8 hours. Attainment of steady state can vary dramatically,
ranging from 35 hours to 2 weeks, so dosage adjustments should occur only every 5 to 7 days. Upon repeated
dosing, methadone can accumulate due to the long terminal half-life, leading to toxicity. Overdose is possible when
prescribers are unaware of the long half-life, the incomplete cross-tolerance between methadone and other opioids,
and the titration guidelines to avoid toxic accumulation. The metabolism is variable due to involvement of multiple
CYP450 isoenzymes, some of which are affected by known genetic polymorphisms. As such, methadone is
susceptible to many drug–drug interactions.
Methadone can produce physical dependence like that of morphine, but it has less neurotoxicity than morphine
due to lack of active metabolites. Methadone can prolong the QTc interval and cause torsades de pointes, possibly by
interacting with cardiac potassium channels. Baseline and routine ECG monitoring is recommended.

H.  Meperidine
Meperidine [me-PER-i-deen] is a lower-potency synthetic opioid structurally unrelated to morphine. It is used for
acute pain and acts primarily as a κ agonist, with some μ agonist activity. Meperidine is very lipophilic and has
anticholinergic effects, resulting in an increased incidence of delirium compared with other opioids. Meperidine has
an active metabolite (normeperidine), which is potentially neurotoxic. Normeperidine is renally excreted, and in
patients with renal insufficiency, accumulation of the metabolite may lead to delirium, hyperreflexia, myoclonus,
and seizures. Due to the short duration of action and the potential for toxicity, meperidine should only be used for
short-term (≤48 hours) management of pain. Meperidine should not be used in elderly patients or those with renal
insufficiency, hepatic insufficiency, preexisting respiratory compromise, or concomitant or recent administration of
MAOIs. Serotonin syndrome has been reported in patients receiving both meperidine and selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).

IV.  Partial Agonists and Mixed Agonist–Antagonists
Partial agonists bind to the opioid receptor, but they have less intrinsic activity than full agonists (see Chapter 2).
There is a ceiling to the pharmacologic effects of these agents. Drugs that stimulate one receptor but block another
are termed mixed agonist–antagonists. The effects of these drugs depend on previous exposure to opioids. In
individuals who are opioid-naïve, mixed agonist–antagonists show agonist activity and are used to relieve pain. In
the presence of a full agonist, the agonist–antagonist drugs may precipitate opioid withdrawal symptoms.
566

--- PAGE 567 ---

A.  Buprenorphine
Buprenorphine [byoo-pre-NOR-feen] acts as a potent partial agonist at the μ receptor and an antagonist at the κ
receptors. Buprenorphine is very lipophilic and has a longer duration of action due to its high affinity for the opioid
receptors when compared to morphine. Due to high affinity for the mu receptor, buprenorphine can displace full μ
agonists, leading to withdrawal symptoms in an opioid-dependent patient. Because of the partial μ agonist activity,
buprenorphine provides a “ceiling effect,” causing less euphoric effects and a lower abuse potential than that of full
agonists. Additionally, the risk of opioid-induced respiratory depression may be lower when compared with full
agonists, except when combined with CNS depressants such as benzodiazepines. Buprenorphine is available in
sublingual, transmucosal, buccal, parenteral, subdermal, and transdermal formulations. The drug is approved for
moderate to severe pain. Certain formulations (for example, sublingual and subdermal) are approved for use in
medication-assisted treatment of opioid addiction due to its ability to provide prolonged suppression of opioid
withdrawal, the ability to block other μ agonists, and less frequent dosing requirements. In contrast to methadone,
which is available only at specialized clinics when used for opioid detoxification or maintenance, buprenorphine is
approved for office-based treatment of opioid dependence. It has been shown to have shorter and less severe
withdrawal symptoms compared to methadone (Figure 14.11). Adverse effects include respiratory depression that
cannot easily be reversed by naloxone and decreased (or, rarely, increased) blood pressure, nausea, and dizziness.
Additionally, buprenorphine has been associated with prolongation of the QTc interval. Although the clinical
significance of this effect is controversial, current labeling for some buprenorphine products includes dosing
restrictions due to the concern of QTc prolongation. Risk factors to evaluate when considering buprenorphine
include cardiovascular factors and concurrent drugs that may prolong.

equivalent doses of heroin, buprenorphine, and methadone.

B.  Pentazocine
Pentazocine [pen-TAZ-oh-seen] acts as an agonist on κ receptors and is a weak antagonist or partial agonist at μ
receptors. It can be administered either orally or parenterally. Pentazocine produces less euphoria compared to
morphine, but in higher doses, respiratory depression, increased blood pressure, tachycardia, and hallucinations can
occur. For these reasons, pentazocine is rarely used for management of pain. Despite its antagonist action,
pentazocine does not antagonize the respiratory depression of morphine, but it can precipitate withdrawal effects in a
morphine user. Pentazocine should be used with caution in patients with angina or coronary artery disease, since it
can increase blood pressure.

--- PAGE 570 ---

C.  Nalbuphine and butorphanol
Nalbuphine [NAL-byoo-feen] and butorphanol  [byoo-TOR-fa-nole] are mixed opioid agonist–antagonists. Like
pentazocine, they play a limited role in the treatment of chronic pain. Butorphanol  is available in a nasal spray that
has been used for severe headaches, but it has been associated with abuse. Both products are available in an
injectable formulation. Their propensity to cause psychotomimetic effects is less than that of pentazocine. In contrast
to pentazocine and butorphanol , nalbuphine does not affect the heart or increase blood pressure. A benefit of all
three medications is that they exhibit a ceiling effect for respiratory depression.

--- PAGE 572 ---

A.  Tapentadol
Tapentadol  [ta-PEN-ta-dol], a centrally acting analgesic, is an agonist at the μ opioid receptor and an inhibitor of
norepinephrine reuptake. It is used to manage moderate to severe acute and chronic pain, including neuropathic pain
associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Tapentadol  is mainly metabolized to inactive metabolites via
glucuronidation, and it does not inhibit or induce the CYP450 enzyme system. Because tapentadol  does not produce
active metabolites, dosing adjustment is not necessary in mild to moderate renal impairment. Tapentadol  should be
avoided in patients who have received MAOIs within the past 14 days. It is available in an immediate-release and
extended-release formulation.
572
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 573 ---

B.  Tramadol
Tramadol  [TRA-ma-dole] is a centrally acting analgesic that binds to the μ opioid receptor. It undergoes extensive
metabolism via CYP2D6, leading to an active metabolite, which has a much higher affinity for the mu receptor than
the parent compound. In addition, it weakly inhibits reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. It is used to manage
moderate to severe pain. Of note, tramadol  has less respiratory-depressant activity compared to morphine.
Administration of naloxone can only partially reverse tramadol  toxicity and has been associated with an increased
risk of seizures. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported. Overdose or drug–drug interactions with SSRIs,
MAOIs, and tricyclic antidepressants can lead to toxicity manifested by CNS excitation and seizures. Tramadol
should be used with caution in patients with a history of seizures. As with other agents that bind the μ opioid
receptor, tramadol  has been associated with misuse and abuse.

--- PAGE 574 ---

VI.  Antagonists
The opioid antagonists bind with high affinity to opioid receptors, but they fail to activate the receptor-mediated
response. Administration of opioid antagonists produces no profound effects in individuals not taking opioids. In
opioid-dependent patients, antagonists rapidly reverse the effect of agonists, such as morphine or any full μ agonist,
and precipitate the symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Figure 14.12 summarizes some signs and symptoms of opioid
withdrawal.
Figure 14.12 Opiate withdrawal syndrome. GI = gastrointestinal.

--- PAGE 575 ---

A.  Naloxone
Naloxone [nal-OX-own] is a competitive antagonist at μ, κ, and δ receptors, with a 10-fold higher affinity for mu
than for kappa receptors. It rapidly displaces all receptor-bound opioid molecules and, therefore, can reverse the
effects of morphine overdose, such as respiratory depression and coma within 1 to 2 minutes of IV administration.
Naloxone can also be administered intramuscularly, subcutaneously, and intranasally, with a slightly longer onset of
2 to 5 minutes; however, little to no clinical effect is seen with oral naloxone due to extensive first-pass metabolism.
Since naloxone has a half-life of 30 to 81 minutes, a patient who has been treated for an overdose and recovered
may lapse back into respiratory depression, depending on the opioid ingested and dosage form of that opioid. [Note:
Much higher doses and continuous administration of naloxone are needed to reverse the effects of buprenorphine
due to its high affinity for the mu receptor.]
Naloxone is available in an autoinjector and a nasal inhaler for community distribution for treatment of opioid
overdose involving heroin or prescription opioids. It is imperative that prescribers counsel the patient and family
members regarding the availability of these products, proper instructions for use, and the importance of calling
emergency services in the case of overdose.

--- PAGE 576 ---

B.  Naltrexone
Naltrexone [nal-TREX-own] has actions similar to those of naloxone, but it has a longer duration of action and can
be given orally. For example, a single oral dose of naltrexone blocks the effect of injected heroin for up to 24 hours,
and the intramuscular formulation blocks the effect for 30 days. Naltrexone in combination with clonidine (and,
sometimes, with buprenorphine) is used for rapid opioid detoxification. Naltrexone has been reported to cause
hepatotoxicity and monitoring of hepatic function is recommended.

14.5Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
Which of the agents listed is a phenanthrene opioid that exhibits a full and immediate response to treatment
with naloxone in the case of overdose?
A.  Meperidine
B.  Morphine
C.  Buprenorphine
D.  Fentanyl
Correct answer = B. A morphine overdose can be effectively treated with naloxone, and morphine is a
phenanthrene. Naloxone antagonizes the opioid by displacing it from the receptor, but there are cases in which
naloxone is not effective. Meperidine is a phenylpiperidine, not a phenanthrene, and the active metabolite,
normeperidine, is not reversible by naloxone. The effects of buprenorphine are only partially reversible by
naloxone. In most cases of buprenorphine overdose, the dose of naloxone needs to be high and continuous due to
the higher binding affinity to the mu receptor. Naloxone is effective for fentanyl overdoses; however, fentanyl is a
phenylpiperidine, and not a phenanthrene.
A 76-year-old female with renal insufficiency has severe pain secondary to a compression fracture in the
lumbar spine. She reports that the pain has been uncontrolled with tramadol, and it is decided to start
treatment with an opioid. Which is the best opioid for this patient?
A.  Meperidine
B.  Fentanyl transdermal patch
C.  Hydrocodone/acetaminophen
D.  Morphine
Correct answer = C. Hydrocodone/acetaminophen is the best choice. It is very important to use a low dose and
monitor closely for proper pain control and adverse effects. Meperidine should not be used for chronic pain, nor
should it be used in a patient with renal insufficiency. The transdermal patch is not a good option, since her pain
is considered acute and she is opioid naïve. Morphine is not the best choice due to the active metabolites that can
accumulate in renal insufficiency.
Which statement about buprenorphine is correct?
A.  Buprenorphine has a much higher incidence of opioid-induced respiratory depression compared to other μ
agonists.
B.  Buprenorphine has many dosage formulations, and all formulations can be prescribed for the treatment of pain or
opioid dependence.
C.  Buprenorphine has a lower number of drug–drug interactions compared to methadone.
D.  Buprenorphine is a full μ agonist, an antagonist of the NMDA receptor, and a norepinephrine and serotonin
reuptake inhibitor.
Correct answer = C. Buprenorphine is metabolized by the CYP3A4 system, so there are concerns about drug
interactions; however, compared to methadone, which is metabolized by numerous CYP450 enzymes, the drug
interaction concern for buprenorphine is much lower. Buprenorphine has a lower incidence of opioid-induced
respiratory depression compared to the μ agonists due to the ceiling effect created by the partial μ agonist activity.
Buprenorphine is available in many different dosage formulations, but these formulations are indicated for either
pain management or medication-assisted treatment of opioid dependence, not both. Option D describes the
mechanism of action of methadone. Buprenorphine is a potent partial μ agonist and a κ antagonist.
A 56-year-old patient has suffered with painful diabetic neuropathy and severe chronic back pain with
radiculopathy secondary to spinal stenosis for many years. This patient has failed to receive relief from his
neuropathic pain with first-line agents such as tricyclics, SNRIs, or anticonvulsants. Based on the mechanism
of action, which opioid could be considered in this patient to treat both nociceptive and neuropathic pain?
A.  Meperidine
B.  Oxymorphone
C.  Morphine
D.  Tapentadol
Correct answer = D. Tapentadol has a unique mechanism of action in comparison with the other choices given.
Tapentadol has a dual mechanism of action (μ agonist and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition), which has been
shown to effectively treat neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. All other μ agonists
could help manage neuropathic pain, but in some situations, higher doses of opioids are needed to achieve
efficacy.
Which of the following statements regarding methadone is correct?
A.  Methadone is an excellent choice for analgesia in most patients because there are limited drug–drug interactions.
B.  The equianalgesic potency of methadone is similar to that of morphine.
C.  The duration of analgesia for methadone is much shorter than the elimination half-life.577

14.7
14.8
14.9
14.10D.  The active metabolites of methadone accumulate in patients with renal dysfunction.
Correct Answer = C. The duration of analgesia is much shorter than the elimination half-life, leading to dangers
of accumulation and increased potential for respiratory depression and death. The equianalgesic potency of
methadone is extremely variable based on many factors, and only providers familiar with methadone should
prescribe this agent. The drug interactions associated with methadone are numerous due to the multiple liver
enzymes that metabolize the drug. Methadone does not have active metabolites, which makes it a treatment
option in patients with renal dysfunction.
AN is a 57-year-old man who has been treated with oxycodone for chronic nonmalignant pain for over 2
years. He now reports increased pain in the afternoon while at work. Which of the following is a short-acting
opioid and is the best choice for this patient’s breakthrough pain?
A.  Methadone
B.  Fentanyl
C.  Hydrocodone
D.  Nalbuphine
Correct answer = C. Hydrocodone is a commonly used short-acting agent that is commercially available in
combination with either acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Methadone should not routinely be used for breakthrough
pain due to the unique pharmacokinetics and should be reserved for practitioners who have experience with this
agent and understand the variables associated with this drug. Fentanyl is available in formulations for treatment of
breakthrough pain for cancer treatment. It is not appropriate to use fentanyl in this type of chronic pain setting.
Nalbuphine is a mixed agonist/antagonist analgesic that could precipitate withdrawal in patients who are currently
taking a full μ agonist such as oxycodone.
A 64-year-old man is preparing for a total knee replacement. He is taking many medications that are
metabolized by the CYP450 enzyme system and is worried about drug interactions with the pain medication
that will be used following surgery. Which of the following opioids would have the lowest chance of drug
interactions in this patient?
A.  Methadone
B.  Tapentadol
C.  Tramadol
D.  Oxycodone
Correct answer = B. Tapentadol is metabolized via glucuronidation and has not been shown to have any clinically
relevant drug interactions associated with the CYP450 enzyme family. All other opioids listed are metabolized by
one or more CYP450 enzymes and increase the risk of drug interactions.
Which of the following statements regarding adverse effects of opioid therapy is correct?
A.  The risk of respiratory depression is highest during an initial opioid initiation or following a dose increase.
B.  Opioid-induced constipation is only seen with the initiation of opioid therapy.
C.  The incidence of nausea and sedation increases with long-term use of opioid therapy.
D.  Decreased testosterone levels are commonly seen with short-term use of opioid therapy.
Correct answer = A. The risk of respiratory depression is highest when the opioid is first initiated or a dosage is
raised (or sometimes a drug–drug interaction leads to higher opioid levels). Opioid-induced constipation can
occur at any time during the therapy, and a patient does not develop a tolerance to this side effect. Side effects
such as nausea and sedation commonly decrease after repeated dosing due to development of tolerance to these
adverse effects. Chronic opioid exposure has been linked to decreased testosterone levels in males.
KM is a 64-year-old man who has been hospitalized following a car accident in which he sustained a broken
leg and broken arm. He has been converted to oral morphine in anticipation of discharge from the hospital.
Upon discharge, which medication should he receive along with the morphine?
A.  Diphenhydramine
B.  Methylphenidate
C.  Senna
D.  Docusate sodium
Correct answer = C. A bowel regimen should be prescribed with the initiation of the opioid since constipation is
very common and can occur at any time, and tolerance to this adverse effect does not occur. Senna is a stimulant
that is available over-the-counter. Docusate sodium is a stool softener that is ineffective in opioid-induced
constipation when used as a single agent. Combination products that include both docusate and senna are
commonly used and can be effective, mainly due to the actions of senna. Diphenhydramine can be used for
urticaria that might occur with the initiation of an opioid, and methylphenidate has been used for opioid-induced
sedation in certain situations, but these issues are not reported in this case.
AN is a 67-year-old man who has been treated with oxycodone for chronic nonmalignant pain with no
changes in the dosing regimen for over 2 years. His pain has been fairly well controlled, and he remains
active, reports satisfaction with his pain regimen, and denies any side effects. He has been recently diagnosed578
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 579 ---

with COPD and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Which of the following options is the best treatment
recommendation for him at this time?
A.  Taper off all opioids due to increased risk of opioid-induced respiratory depression.
B.  Prescribe naloxone nasal spray to have at home in case he experiences an opioid overdose.
C.  Prescribe oral naloxone tablets to have at home in case he experiences an opioid overdose.
D.  No action is needed at this time. His pain is well controlled, and he is reporting no side effects.
Correct answer = B. Because this patient has just been diagnosed with COPD and OSA, it is clear his risk for
opioid-induced respiratory depression is greater. Since the pain is controlled and no side effects are reported,
tapering off the opioids at this time is not the best answer. Because of the first-pass effect, naloxone is not
clinically effective for management of an overdose when given orally. Therefore, the nasal spray is the best
choice. Offering the at-home naloxone nasal spray, along with proper education, might be lifesaving if an
overdose occurs. Providing proper education to the patient and caregivers on the importance of having the
naloxone nasal spray at home and of calling emergency services is critical in case of an overdose situation.

I.  Overview
Psychomotor stimulants and hallucinogens are two groups of drugs that act primarily to stimulate the central
nervous system (CNS). The psychomotor stimulants cause excitement and euphoria, decrease feelings of fatigue,
and increase motor activity. The hallucinogens produce profound changes in thought patterns and mood, with little
effect on the brainstem and spinal cord. As a group, the CNS stimulants have diverse clinical uses and are also
potential drugs of abuse, as are the CNS depressants (Chapter 9) and the opioids (Chapter 14). Figure 15.1
summarizes the CNS stimulants.

A.  Methylxanthines
The methylxanthines include theophylline [thee-OFF-i-lin], which is found in tea; theobromine [thee-oh-BROE-
meen], which is found in cocoa; and caffeine [kaf-EEN]. Caffeine, the most widely consumed stimulant in the world,
is found in highest concentration in certain coffee products (for example, espresso), but it is also present in tea, cola
drinks, energy drinks, chocolate candy, and cocoa.
1.  Mechanism of action
Several mechanisms have been proposed for the actions of methylxanthines, including translocation of extracellular
calcium, increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate and cyclic guanosine monophosphate caused by inhibition of
phosphodiesterase, and blockade of adenosine receptors.
2.  Actions
a.  CNS
The caffeine contained in one to two cups of coffee (100 to 200 mg) causes a decrease in fatigue and increased
mental alertness as a result of stimulating the cortex and other areas of the brain. Consumption of 1.5 g of caffeine
(12 to 15 cups of coffee) produces anxiety and tremors. The spinal cord is stimulated only by very high doses (2 to 5
g) of caffeine. Tolerance can rapidly develop to the stimulating properties of caffeine, and withdrawal consists of
feelings of fatigue and sedation.
b.  Cardiovascular system
A high dose of caffeine has positive inotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart. [Note: Increased contractility
can be harmful to patients with angina pectoris. In others, an accelerated heart rate can trigger premature ventricular
contractions.]
c.  Diuretic action
Caffeine has a mild diuretic action that increases urinary output of sodium, chloride, and potassium.
d.  Gastric mucosa
Because methylxanthines stimulate secretion of gastric acid, individuals with peptic ulcers should avoid foods and
beverages containing methylxanthines.
3.  Therapeutic uses
Caffeine and its derivatives relax the smooth muscles of the bronchioles. Theophylline has been largely replaced by
other agents, such as β2 agonists and corticosteroids, for the treatment of asthma (see Chapter 39). Caffeine is also
used in combination with the analgesics acetaminophen and aspirin for the management of headaches in both
prescription and over-the-counter products.
4.  Pharmacokinetics
The methylxanthines are well absorbed orally. Caffeine distributes throughout the body, including the brain. These
drugs cross the placenta to the fetus and are secreted into the breast milk. All methylxanthines are metabolized in the
liver, generally by the CYP1A2 pathway, and the metabolites are excreted in the urine.
5.  Adverse effects
Moderate doses of caffeine cause insomnia, anxiety, and agitation. A high dosage is required for toxicity, which is
manifested by emesis and convulsions. The lethal dose is 10 g of caffeine (about 100 cups of coffee), which induces
cardiac arrhythmias. Lethargy, irritability, and headache occur in users who routinely consume more than 600 mg of
caffeine per day (roughly six cups of coffee per day) and then suddenly stop.

B.  Nicotine
Nicotine [NIK-o-teen] is the active ingredient in tobacco. Although this drug is not currently used therapeutically
(except in smoking cessation therapy), nicotine remains important because it is second only to caffeine as the most
widely used CNS stimulant, and it is second only to alcohol as the most abused drug. In combination with the tars
and carbon monoxide found in cigarette smoke, nicotine represents a serious risk factor for lung and cardiovascular
disease, and other illnesses.
1.  Mechanism of action
In low doses, nicotine causes ganglionic stimulation by depolarization. At high doses, nicotine causes ganglionic
blockade. Nicotine receptors exist at a number of sites in the CNS, which participate in the stimulant attributes of the
drug.
2.  Actions
a.  CNS
Nicotine is highly lipid soluble and readily crosses the blood–brain barrier. Cigarette smoking or administration of
low doses of nicotine produces some degree of euphoria and arousal, as well as relaxation. It improves attention,
learning, problem solving, and reaction time. High doses of nicotine result in central respiratory paralysis and severe
hypotension caused by medullary paralysis (Figure 15.2). Nicotine is also an appetite suppressant.
Figure 15.2 Actions of nicotine on the CNS.
b.  Peripheral effects
The peripheral effects of nicotine are complex. Stimulation of sympathetic ganglia as well as of the adrenal medulla
increases blood pressure and heart rate. Thus, use of tobacco is particularly harmful in hypertensive patients. Many
patients with peripheral vascular disease experience an exacerbation of symptoms with smoking. In addition,
nicotine-induced vasoconstriction can decrease coronary blood flow, adversely affecting a patient with angina.
Stimulation of parasympathetic ganglia also increases motor activity of the bowel. At higher doses, blood pressure
falls and activity ceases in both the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and bladder musculature as a result of a nicotine-
induced block of parasympathetic ganglia.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
Because nicotine is highly lipid soluble, absorption readily occurs via the oral mucosa, lungs, GI mucosa, and skin.
Nicotine crosses the placental membrane and is secreted in the breast milk. By inhaling tobacco smoke, the average
smoker takes in 1 to 2 mg of nicotine per cigarette. The acute lethal dose is 60 mg. More than 90% of the nicotine
inhaled in smoke is absorbed. Clearance of nicotine involves metabolism in the lung and the liver and urinary584
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 585 ---

excretion. Tolerance to the toxic effects of nicotine develops rapidly, often within days.
4.  Adverse effects
The CNS effects of nicotine include irritability and tremors. Nicotine may also cause intestinal cramps, diarrhea, and
increased heart rate and blood pressure. In addition, cigarette smoking increases the rate of metabolism for a number
of drugs.
5.  Withdrawal syndrome
As with the other drugs in this class, nicotine is an addictive substance, and physical dependence develops rapidly
and can be severe (Figure 15.3). Withdrawal is characterized by irritability, anxiety, restlessness, difficulty
concentrating, headaches, and insomnia. Appetite is affected, and GI upset often occurs. The transdermal patch and
chewing gum containing nicotine have been shown to reduce nicotine withdrawal symptoms and to help smokers
stop smoking. For example, the blood concentration of nicotine obtained from nicotine chewing gum is typically
about one-half the peak level observed with smoking (Figure 15.4). Other forms of nicotine replacement used for
smoking cessation include the inhaler, nasal spray, and lozenges. Bupropion, an antidepressant (Chapter 10), can
reduce the craving for cigarettes, assist in smoking cessation, and attenuate symptoms of withdrawal.

C.  Varenicline
Varenicline [ver-EN-ih-kleen] is a partial agonist at neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the CNS. Because
varenicline is only a partial agonist at these receptors, it produces less euphoric effects than nicotine (nicotine is a
full agonist). Thus, it is useful as an adjunct in the management of smoking cessation in patients with nicotine
withdrawal symptoms. Patients taking varenicline should be monitored for suicidal thoughts, vivid nightmares, and
mood changes.

D.  Cocaine
Cocaine [koe-KANE] is a widely available and highly addictive drug. Because of its abuse potential, cocaine is
classified as a Schedule II drug by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency. The primary mechanism of action
underlying the effects of cocaine is blockade of reuptake of the monoamines (norepinephrine, serotonin, and
dopamine) into the presynaptic terminals. This potentiates and prolongs the CNS and peripheral actions of these
monoamines. In particular, the prolongation of dopaminergic effects in the brain’s pleasure system (limbic system)
produces the intense euphoria that cocaine initially causes. Chronic intake of cocaine depletes dopamine. This
depletion triggers craving for cocaine (Figure 15.5). A full description of cocaine and its effects is provided in
Chapter 45.
Figure 15.5 Cocaine and amphetamine have potential for addiction.

--- PAGE 590 ---

E.  Amphetamine
Amphetamine [am-FET-a-meen] is a sympathetic amine that shows neurologic and clinical effects similar to those of
cocaine. Dextroamphetamine [dex-troe-am-FET-a-meen] is the major member of this class of compounds.
Methamphetamine [meth-am-FET-a-meen] (also known as “speed”) is a derivative of amphetamine available for
prescription use. 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (also known as MDMA, or ecstasy) is a synthetic derivative
of methamphetamine with both stimulant and hallucinogenic properties (see Chapter 45).
1.  Mechanism of action
As with cocaine, the effects of amphetamine on the CNS and peripheral nervous system are indirect. That is, both
depend upon an elevation of the level of catecholamine neurotransmitters in synaptic spaces. Amphetamine,
however, achieves this effect by releasing intracellular stores of catecholamines ( Figure 15.6). Because
amphetamine also inhibits monoamine oxidase (MAO) and is a weak reuptake transport inhibitor, high levels of
catecholamines are present in synaptic spaces. Despite different mechanisms of action, the behavioral effects of
amphetamine and its derivatives are similar to those of cocaine.

--- PAGE 592 ---

Figure 15.6 Mechanism of action of amphetamine .
2.  Actions
a.  CNS
The major behavioral effects of amphetamine result from a combination of its dopamine and norepinephrine
release–enhancing properties. Amphetamine stimulates the entire cerebrospinal axis, cortex, brainstem, and medulla.
This leads to increased alertness, decreased fatigue, depressed appetite, and insomnia. The CNS stimulant effects of
amphetamine and its derivatives have led to their use in the treatment of hyperactivity in children, narcolepsy, and
obesity. At high doses, psychosis and convulsions may occur.
b.  Sympathetic nervous system
In addition to marked action on the CNS, amphetamine acts on the adrenergic system, indirectly stimulating the
receptors through norepinephrine release.
3.  Therapeutic uses
Factors that limit the therapeutic usefulness of amphetamine include psychological and physiologic dependence.
a.  Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
Some children are hyperkinetic and lack the ability to be involved in any activity for longer than a few minutes.
Dextroamphetamine, methamphetamine, the mixed amphetamine salts, and methylphenidate [meth-ill-FEN-ih-date]
help improve attention span and alleviate many of the behavioral problems associated with this syndrome, in
addition to reducing hyperkinesia. Lisdexamfetamine [lis-dex-am-FET-a-meen] is a prodrug that is converted to L-
lysine and the active component dextroamphetamine through the hydrolytic actions of red blood cells. Atomoxetine
[AT-oh-MOX-ih-teen] is a nonstimulant drug approved for ADHD in children and adults. Unlike methylphenidate,
which blocks dopamine reuptake more than norepinephrine reuptake, atomoxetine is more selective for inhibition of
norepinephrine reuptake. Therefore, it is not considered habit forming and is not a controlled substance.
b.  Narcolepsy
Narcolepsy is a relatively rare sleep disorder that is characterized by uncontrollable bouts of sleepiness during the
day. The sleepiness can be treated with drugs, such as the mixed amphetamine salts or methylphenidate. Modafinil
[moe-DA-fi-nil] and its R-enantiomer derivative, armodafinil  [ar-moe-DA-fi-nil], are considered first-line agents for
the treatment of narcolepsy. Modafinil  promotes wakefulness, but it produces less psychoactive and euphoric effects
and fewer alterations in mood, perception, thinking, and feelings typical of other CNS stimulants. The mechanism of
action remains unclear but may involve the adrenergic and dopaminergic systems. Modafinil  is well distributed
throughout the body and undergoes elimination via hepatic metabolism and excretion in the urine. Headaches,
nausea, and nervousness are the primary adverse effects. Modafinil  and armodafinil  may have some potential for
abuse and physical dependence, and both are classified as controlled substances.
c.  Appetite suppression
Phentermine [FEN-ter-meen] and diethylpropion [dye-eth-ill-PROE-pee-on] are sympathomimetic amines that are
related structurally to amphetamine. These agents are used for appetite suppressant effects in the management of
obesity (see Chapter 37).
4.  Pharmacokinetics
Amphetamine is completely absorbed from the GI tract, metabolized by the liver, and excreted in the urine. [Note:
Administration of urinary alkalinizing agents such as sodium bicarbonate increase the nonionized species of the
drug and enhance the reabsorption of dextroamphetamine from the renal tubules into the bloodstream.]
Amphetamine abusers often administer the drug by IV injection and/or by smoking. The euphoria caused by
amphetamine lasts 4 to 6 hours, or four- to eightfold longer than the effects of cocaine.
5.  Adverse effects
The amphetamines may cause addiction, leading to dependence, tolerance, and drug-seeking behavior. In addition,
they have the following undesirable effects:
a.  CNS effects
Adverse effects of amphetamine usage include insomnia, irritability, weakness, dizziness, tremor, and hyperactive
reflexes (Figure 15.7). Amphetamine can also cause confusion, delirium, panic states, and suicidal tendencies,
especially in mentally ill patients. [Note: Benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam, are often used in the management of
agitation and CNS stimulation secondary to amphetamine overdose.] Chronic amphetamine use produces a state of
“amphetamine psychosis” that resembles the psychotic episodes associated with schizophrenia. Whereas long-term
amphetamine use is associated with psychological and physical dependence, tolerance to its effects may occur
within a few weeks. The anorectic effect of amphetamine is due to action in the lateral hypothalamic feeding center.

Figure 15.7 Adverse effects of amphetamines and methylphenidate.
b.  Cardiovascular effects
In addition to CNS effects, amphetamine may cause palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, anginal pain,
and circulatory collapse. Headache, chills, and excessive sweating may also occur.
c.  Gastrointestinal effects
Amphetamine acts on the GI system, causing anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea.
d.  Contraindications
Patients with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, or a history of drug abuse or those
taking MAO inhibitors should not be treated with amphetamine.

--- PAGE 595 ---

F.  Methylphenidate
Methylphenidate has CNS stimulant properties similar to those of amphetamine and is often used in the treatment of
ADHD. Methylphenidate has abuse potential and is a Schedule II controlled substance. The pharmacologically
active isomer, dexmethylphenidate, is also a Schedule II drug used for the treatment of ADHD.
1.  Mechanism of action
Children with ADHD may produce weak dopamine signals, which suggest that once-interesting activities provide
fewer rewards to these children. Methylphenidate is a dopamine and norepinephrine transport inhibitor and may act
by increasing both dopamine and norepinephrine in the synaptic cleft.
2.  Therapeutic uses
Methylphenidate is used in the treatment of ADHD. It is also effective in the treatment of narcolepsy. Unlike
methylphenidate, dexmethylphenidate is not indicated in the treatment of narcolepsy.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
Both methylphenidate and dexmethylphenidate are readily absorbed after oral administration. Methylphenidate is
available in extended-release oral formulations and as a transdermal patch for once-daily application. The
deesterified product, ritalinic acid, is excreted in urine.
4.  Adverse effects
GI adverse effects are the most common and include abdominal pain and nausea. Other reactions include anorexia,
insomnia, nervousness, and fever. In patients with epilepsy, methylphenidate may increase seizure frequency. The
drug is contraindicated in patients with glaucoma. Methylphenidate can inhibit the metabolism of warfarin,
phenytoin, phenobarbital , primidone, and the tricyclic antidepressants.

III.  Hallucinogens
A few drugs have, as their primary action, the ability to induce altered perceptual states reminiscent of dreams.
Many of these altered states are accompanied by visions of bright, colorful changes in the environment and by a
plasticity of constantly changing shapes and color. The individual under the influence of these drugs is incapable of
normal decision-making because the drug interferes with rational thought. These compounds are known as
hallucinogens, and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and tetrahydrocannabinol  (from marijuana) are examples of
agents in this class. These agents are discussed in detail in Chapter 45.

15.6Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
A young male was brought to the emergency room by the police due to severe agitation. Psychiatric
examination revealed that he had injected dextroamphetamine several times in the past few days. The last use
was 10 hours prior. He was given an intramuscular drug that sedated him, and he fell asleep. Which drug was
most likely used to counter this patient’s symptoms of dextroamphetamine withdrawal?
A.  Trazodone
B.  Lorazepam
C.  Cocaine
D.  Hydroxyzine
Correct answer = B. The anxiolytic properties of benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam, make them the drugs of
choice in treating the anxiety and agitation of amphetamine or cocaine abuse. Lorazepam also has hypnotic
properties. Trazodone has hypnotic properties, but its anxiolytic properties are inferior to those of the
benzodiazepines. Hydroxyzine, an antihistamine, is effective as a hypnotic, and it is sometimes used to deal with
anxiety, especially if emesis is a problem but it is rarely used in the emergency situation when rapid anxiolytic
and antiseizure treatment is warranted.
A 10-year-old boy is sent to a pediatric neurologist for an evaluation due to poor performance and inability
to pay attention in school. He has also been fighting with other children. He is given a diagnosis of ADHD
with impulsivity and irritability. Which is most appropriate for management of the ADHD?
A.  Clonidine
B.  Mirtazapine
C.  Dextroamphetamine
D.  Haloperidol
Correct answer = C. Dextroamphetamine is the only stimulant medication in the list that is approved for ADHD.
Symptoms like fighting may improve with haloperidol, and hyperactivity may improve with clonidine, but these
agents would not improve the patient’s academic performance and the underlying problems.
A 10-year-old boy with ADHD has symptoms that are controlled with an oral psychostimulant. However, he
and his family wish to avoid having to give a second dose of medication at school. They prefer an alternative
treatment that can be administered in the morning and last the entire day. Which treatment option is best?
A.  Mixed amphetamine salts in immediate-release oral tablet formulation
B.  Methylphenidate in a transdermal delivery system
C.  Nicotine in a chewing gum formulation for buccal absorption
D.  Methylphenidate in immediate-release pills
Correct answer = B. Methylphenidate is also a psychostimulant, and the transdermal (patch) formulation is
designed for once-daily use to avoid midday dosing. Immediate-release formulations require dosing at least twice
daily.
Which of the following agents for ADHD is a controlled substance (Schedule II)?
A.  Clonidine
B.  Atomoxetine
C.  Lisdexamfetamine
D.  Desipramine
Correct answer = C. Lisdexamfetamine is the only controlled substance on the list and is schedule II. The other
agents may assist in the management of ADHD but are not controlled substances.
Amphetamines may be used in patients with which of the following conditions?
A.  Cardiovascular disease
B.  Hypertension
C.  Hyperthyroidism
D.  Obesity
Correct answer = D. The use of amphetamines in the management of obesity should be closely monitored.
Amphetamine analogs such as phentermine are approved for obesity. The other conditions are contraindications
when considering the use of amphetamines.
Which of the following agents is considered a first-line treatment for narcolepsy?
A.  Galantamine
B.  Atomoxetine
C.  Temazepam
D.  Modafinil597

15.9
15.10Correct answer = D. Modafinil is the only drug listed that is approved for narcolepsy. Temazepam is indicated for
insomnia, galantamine for Alzheimer’s disease, and atomoxetine for ADHD.
Which of the following is a common adverse effect of amphetamines?
A.  Bradycardia
B.  Somnolence
C.  Constipation
D.  Hypertension
Correct answer = D. Hypertension is a possible adverse effect that warrants caution, especially in individuals with
risk factors for increased blood pressure. Amphetamines cause tachycardia (not bradycardia), insomnia (not
somnolence), and diarrhea (not constipation).
Which of the following CNS stimulants occurs naturally and can be found in certain candies?
A.  Amphetamine
B.  Modafinil
C.  Caffeine
D.  Atomoxetine
Correct answer = C. Caffeine is a naturally occurring substance found in cocoa, chocolate, and many forms of tea.
Overuse of cola beverages and other caffeine-containing products may cause adverse effects, including anxiety
and insomnia, and even increase the risk for seizures.
A 35-year-old man is interested in quitting smoking. In previous quit attempts, he has tried nicotine gum, the
nicotine patch, and the “cold turkey” method. He has been unsuccessful in each of these attempts and
resumed smoking within 4 to 6 weeks. Which may be useful to assist in his attempt to quit smoking?
A.  Varenicline
B.  Dextroamphetamine
C.  Lorazepam
D.  Methylphenidate
Correct answer = A. Varenicline is approved as an adjunctive treatment option for the management of nicotine
dependence. It is believed to attenuate the withdrawal symptoms of smoking cessation, though monitoring is
needed for changes in psychiatric status, including suicidal ideation. The use of dextroamphetamine, lorazepam,
and methylphenidate bring the risk of addiction to another substance with abuse potential.
Which of the following agents carries the lowest risk for addiction?
A.  Armodafinil
B.  Lisdexamfetamine
C.  Dexmethylphenidate
D.  Varenicline
Correct answer = D. Varenicline is the only agent listed that is not a controlled substance. All of the other agents
are considered to have a risk for addiction and/or dependence.

I.  Overview
Blood pressure is elevated when systolic blood pressure exceeds 120 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure remains
below 80 mm Hg. Hypertension occurs when systolic blood pressure exceeds 130 mm Hg or diastolic blood
pressure exceeds 80 mm Hg on at least two occasions. Hypertension results from increased peripheral vascular
arteriolar smooth muscle tone, which leads to increased arteriolar resistance and reduced capacitance of the venous
system. In most cases, the cause of the increased vascular tone is unknown. Elevated blood pressure is a common
disorder, affecting approximately 30% of adults in the United States. Although many patients have no symptoms,
chronic hypertension can lead to heart disease and stroke, the top two causes of death in the world. Hypertension is
also an important risk factor in the development of chronic kidney disease and heart failure. The incidence of
morbidity and mortality significantly decreases when hypertension is diagnosed early and is properly treated. The
drugs used in the treatment of hypertension are shown in Figure 16.1. In recognition of the progressive nature of
hypertension, hypertension is classified into four categories (Figure 16.2). The majority of current guidelines
recommend treatment decisions based on goals of antihypertensive therapy, rather than the category of hypertension.

II.  Etiology of Hypertension
Although hypertension may occur secondary to other disease processes, more than 90% of patients have essential
hypertension (hypertension with no identifiable cause). A family history of hypertension increases the likelihood
that an individual will develop hypertension. The prevalence of hypertension increases with age but decreases with
education and income level. Non-Hispanic blacks have a higher incidence of hypertension than do both non-
Hispanic whites and Hispanic whites. Persons with diabetes, obesity, or disability status are all more likely to have
hypertension than those without these conditions. In addition, environmental factors, such as a stressful lifestyle,
high dietary intake of sodium, and smoking, may further predispose an individual to hypertension.

III.  Mechanisms for Controlling Blood Pressure
Arterial blood pressure is regulated within a narrow range to provide adequate perfusion of the tissues without
causing damage to the vascular system, particularly the arterial intima (endothelium). Arterial blood pressure is
directly proportional to cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance (Figure 16.3). Cardiac output and
peripheral resistance, in turn, are controlled mainly by two overlapping mechanisms: the baroreflexes and the renin–
angiotensin–aldosterone system (Figure 16.4). Most antihypertensive drugs lower blood pressure by reducing
cardiac output and/or decreasing peripheral resistance.
Figure 16.3 Major factors influencing blood pressure.

Figure 16.4 Response of the autonomic nervous system and the renin–angiotensin–
aldosterone system to a decrease in blood pressure.
606
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 607 ---

A.  Baroreceptors and the sympathetic nervous system
Baroreflexes act by changing the activity of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. Therefore, they
are responsible for the rapid, moment-to-moment regulation of blood pressure. A fall in blood pressure causes
pressure-sensitive neurons (baroreceptors in the aortic arch and carotid sinuses) to send fewer impulses to
cardiovascular centers in the spinal cord. This prompts a reflex response of increased sympathetic and decreased
parasympathetic output to the heart and vasculature, resulting in vasoconstriction and increased cardiac output.
These changes result in a compensatory rise in blood pressure (Figure 16.4).
607
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 608 ---

B.  Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system
The kidney provides long-term control of blood pressure by altering the blood volume. Baroreceptors in the kidney
respond to reduced arterial pressure (and to sympathetic stimulation of β1-adrenoceptors) by releasing the enzyme
renin (Figure 16.4). Low-sodium intake and greater sodium loss also increase renin release. Renin converts
angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is converted in turn to angiotensin II, in the presence of angiotensin
converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II is a potent circulating vasoconstrictor, constricting both arterioles and
veins, resulting in an increase in blood pressure. Angiotensin II exerts a preferential vasoconstrictor action on the
efferent arterioles of the renal glomerulus, increasing glomerular filtration. Furthermore, angiotensin II stimulates
aldosterone secretion, leading to increased renal sodium reabsorption and increased blood volume, which contribute
to a further increase in blood pressure. These effects of angiotensin II are mediated by stimulation of angiotensin II
type 1 (AT1) receptors.
608

--- PAGE 609 ---

IV.  Treatment Strategies
The goal of antihypertensive therapy is to reduce cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. For most
patients, the blood pressure goal when treating hypertension is a systolic blood pressure of less than 130 mm Hg and
a diastolic blood pressure of less than 80 mm Hg. Current recommendations are to initiate therapy with a thiazide
diuretic, ACE inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), or calcium channel blocker. However, initial drug
therapy choice may vary depending on the guideline and concomitant diseases (Figure 16.5). If blood pressure is
inadequately controlled, a second drug should be added, with the selection based on minimizing the adverse effects
of the combined regimen and achieving goal blood pressure. Patients with systolic blood pressure greater than 20
mm Hg above goal or diastolic blood pressure more than 10 mm Hg above goal should be started on two
antihypertensives simultaneously. Combination therapy with separate agents or a fixed-dose combination pill may
lower blood pressure more quickly with minimal adverse effects. A variety of combination formulations of the
various pharmacologic classes are available to increase ease of patient adherence to treatment regimens that require
multiple medications.

A.  Individualized care
Hypertension may coexist with other conditions that can be aggravated by some of the antihypertensive drugs or that
may benefit from the use of some antihypertensive drugs independent of blood pressure control. In such cases, it is
important to match antihypertensive drugs to the particular patient. Figure 16.6 shows preferred therapies in
hypertensive patients with concomitant diseases. In addition to the choice of therapy, blood pressure goals may also
be individualized based on concurrent disease states and age (Figure 16.5).

enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.]

V.  Diuretics
For all classes of diuretics, the initial mechanism of action is based upon decreasing blood volume, which ultimately
leads to decreased blood pressure. Routine serum electrolyte monitoring should be done for all patients receiving
diuretics. A complete discussion of the actions, therapeutic uses, pharmacokinetics, and adverse effects of diuretics
can be found in Chapter 17.
611
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 612 ---

A.  Thiazide diuretics
Thiazide diuretics, such as hydrochlorothiazide [hye-droe-klor-oh-THYE-a-zide] and chlorthalidone [klor-THAL-
ih-done], lower blood pressure initially by increasing sodium and water excretion. This causes a decrease in
extracellular volume, resulting in a decrease in cardiac output and renal blood flow ( Figure 16.7). With long-term
treatment, plasma volume approaches a normal value, but a hypotensive effect persists that is related to a decrease in
peripheral resistance. Thiazide diuretics can be used as initial drug therapy for hypertension unless there are
compelling reasons to choose another agent. Thiazides are useful in combination therapy with a variety of other
antihypertensive agents, including β-blockers, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and potassium-sparing diuretics. With the
exception of metolazone [me-TOL-ah-zone], thiazide diuretics are not effective in patients with inadequate kidney
function (estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL/min/m2). Loop diuretics may be required in these
patients. Thiazide diuretics can induce hypokalemia, hyperuricemia, and, to a lesser extent, hyperglycemia in some
patients.

B.  Loop diuretics
The loop diuretics (furosemide, torsemide, bumetanide, and ethacrynic acid; see Chapter 17) act promptly by
blocking sodium and chloride reabsorption in the kidneys, even in patients with poor renal function or those who
have not responded to thiazide diuretics. Loop diuretics cause decreased renal vascular resistance and increased
renal blood flow. Like thiazides, they can cause hypokalemia. However, unlike thiazides, loop diuretics increase the
calcium content of urine, whereas thiazide diuretics decrease it. These agents are rarely used alone to treat
hypertension, but they are commonly used to manage symptoms of heart failure and edema.

C.  Potassium-sparing diuretics
Amiloride [a-MIL-oh-ride] and triamterene [tri-AM-ter-een] are inhibitors of epithelial sodium transport at the late
distal and collecting ducts, and spironolactone [speer-on-oh-LAK-tone] and eplerenone [eh-PLEH-reh-none] are
aldosterone receptor antagonists. All of these agents reduce potassium loss in the urine. Aldosterone antagonists
have the additional benefit of diminishing the cardiac remodeling that occurs in heart failure (see Chapter 18).
Potassium-sparing diuretics are sometimes used in combination with loop diuretics and thiazides to reduce the
amount of potassium loss induced by these diuretics.

VI.  β-Adrenoceptor–Blocking Agents
β-Blockers are a treatment option for hypertensive patients with concomitant heart disease or heart failure (Figure
16.6).
615
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 616 ---

A.  Actions
The β-blockers reduce blood pressure primarily by decreasing cardiac output (Figure 16.8). They may also decrease
sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system (CNS) and inhibit the release of renin from the kidneys, thus
decreasing the formation of angiotensin II and the secretion of aldosterone. The prototype β-blocker is propranolol
[proe-PRAN-oh-lol], which acts at both β1 and β2 receptors. Selective blockers of β1 receptors, such as metoprolol
[met-OH-pro-lol] and atenolol  [ah-TEN-oh-lol], are among the most commonly prescribed β-blockers. Nebivolol
[ne-BIV-oh-lole] is a selective blocker of β1 receptors, which also increases the production of nitric oxide, leading to
vasodilation. The selective β-blockers may be administered cautiously to hypertensive patients who also have
asthma. The nonselective β-blockers are contraindicated in patients with asthma due to their blockade of β2-
mediated bronchodilation. (See Chapter 7 for an in-depth discussion of β-blockers.) β-Blockers should be used
cautiously in the treatment of patients with acute heart failure or peripheral vascular disease.
Figure 16.8 Actions of β-adrenoceptor–blocking agents.
616
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 617 ---

B.  Therapeutic uses
The primary therapeutic benefits of β-blockers are seen in hypertensive patients with concomitant heart disease,
such as supraventricular tachyarrhythmia (for example, atrial fibrillation), previous myocardial infarction, stable
ischemic heart disease, and chronic heart failure. Conditions that discourage the use of β-blockers include reversible
bronchospastic disease such as asthma, second- and third-degree heart block, and severe peripheral vascular disease.
617
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 618 ---

C.  Pharmacokinetics
The β-blockers are orally active for the treatment of hypertension. Propranolol  undergoes extensive and highly
variable first-pass metabolism. Oral β-blockers may take several weeks to develop their full effects. Esmolol ,
metoprolol , and propranolol  are available in intravenous formulations.
618
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 619 ---

D.  Adverse effects
1.  Common effects
Figure 16.9 describes some of the adverse effects of β-blockers. The β-blockers may decrease libido and cause
erectile dysfunction, which can severely reduce patient compliance.

--- PAGE 621 ---

2.  Alterations in serum lipid patterns
Noncardioselective β-blockers may disturb lipid metabolism, decreasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and
increasing triglycerides.
3.  Drug withdrawal
Abrupt withdrawal may induce severe hypertension, angina, myocardial infarction, and even sudden death in
patients with ischemic heart disease. Therefore, these drugs must be tapered over a few weeks in patients with
hypertension and ischemic heart disease.
621

--- PAGE 622 ---

VII.  ACE Inhibitors
ACE inhibitors such as captopril  [KAP-toe-pril], enalapril  [e-NAL-ah-pril], and lisinopril  [lye-SIN-oh-pril] are
recommended as first-line treatment of hypertension in patients with a variety of compelling indications, including
high coronary disease risk or history of diabetes, stroke, heart failure, myocardial infarction, or chronic kidney
disease (Figure 16.6).
622
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 623 ---

A.  Actions
The ACE inhibitors lower blood pressure by reducing peripheral vascular resistance without reflexively increasing
cardiac output, heart rate, or contractility. These drugs block the enzyme ACE, which cleaves angiotensin I to form
the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II (Figure 16.10). ACE is also responsible for the breakdown of bradykinin, a
peptide that increases the production of nitric oxide and prostacyclin by the blood vessels. Both nitric oxide and
prostacyclin are potent vasodilators. Vasodilation of both arterioles and veins occurs as a result of decreased
vasoconstriction (from diminished levels of angiotensin II) and enhanced vasodilation (from increased bradykinin).
By reducing circulating angiotensin II levels, ACE inhibitors also decrease the secretion of aldosterone, resulting in
decreased sodium and water retention. ACE inhibitors reduce both cardiac preload and afterload, thereby decreasing
workload on the heart.
Figure 16.10 Effects of various drug classes on the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone
system. Blue = drug target enzymes; red = drug class.
623
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 624 ---

B.  Therapeutic uses
ACE inhibitors slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy and decrease albuminuria and, thus, have a compelling
indication for use in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Beneficial effects on renal function may result from
decreasing intraglomerular pressures, due to efferent arteriolar vasodilation. ACE inhibitors are a standard in the
care of a patient following a myocardial infarction and first-line agents in the treatment of patients with systolic
dysfunction. Chronic treatment with ACE inhibitors achieves sustained blood pressure reduction, regression of left
ventricular hypertrophy, and prevention of ventricular remodeling after a myocardial infarction. ACE inhibitors are
first-line drugs for treating heart failure, hypertensive patients with chronic kidney disease, and patients at increased
risk of coronary artery disease. All of the ACE inhibitors are equally effective in the treatment of hypertension at
equivalent doses.
624
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 625 ---

C.  Pharmacokinetics
All of the ACE inhibitors are orally bioavailable as a drug or prodrug. All but captopril  and lisinopril  undergo
hepatic conversion to active metabolites, so these agents may be preferred in patients with severe hepatic
impairment. Fosinopril  [foe-SIN-oh-pril] is the only ACE inhibitor that is not eliminated primarily by the kidneys.
Therefore, it does not require dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment. Enalaprilat  [en-AL-a-pril-AT] is
the only drug in this class available intravenously.
625
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 626 ---

D.  Adverse effects
Figure 16.11 describes some of the common adverse effects of ACE inhibitors. The dry cough, which occurs in up
to 10% of patients, is thought to be due to increased levels of bradykinin and substance P in the pulmonary tree, and
it occurs more frequently in women. The cough resolves within a few days of discontinuation. Angioedema is a rare
but potentially life-threatening reaction that may also be due to increased levels of bradykinin. Potassium levels
must be monitored while on ACE inhibitors, and potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics should be
used with caution due to the risk of hyperkalemia. Serum creatinine levels should also be monitored, particularly in
patients with underlying renal disease. However, an increase in serum creatinine of up to 30% above baseline is
acceptable and by itself does not warrant discontinuation of treatment. ACE inhibitors can induce fetal
malformations and should not be used by pregnant women.

VIII.  Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers
The ARBs, such as losartan [LOW-sar-tan] and irbesartan [ir-be-SAR-tan], block the AT1 receptors, decreasing the
activation of AT1 receptors by angiotensin II. Their pharmacologic effects are similar to those of ACE inhibitors in
that they produce arteriolar and venous dilation and block aldosterone secretion, thus lowering blood pressure and
decreasing salt and water retention (Figure 16.10). ARBs do not increase bradykinin levels. They may be used as
first-line agents for the treatment of hypertension, especially in patients with a compelling indication of diabetes,
heart failure, or chronic kidney disease (Figure 16.6). Adverse effects are similar to those of ACE inhibitors,
although the risks of cough and angioedema are significantly decreased. ARBs should not be combined with an
ACE inhibitor for the treatment of hypertension due to similar mechanisms and adverse effects. These agents are
also teratogenic and should not be used by pregnant women. [Note: The ARBs are discussed more fully in Chapter
18.]
629
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 630 ---

IX.  Renin Inhibitor
A selective renin inhibitor, aliskiren [a-LIS-ke-rin], is available for the treatment of hypertension. Aliskiren directly
inhibits renin and, thus, acts earlier in the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system than ACE inhibitors or ARBs
(Figure 16.10). Aliskiren should not be combined with an ACE inhibitor or ARB in the treatment of hypertension.
Aliskiren can cause diarrhea, especially at higher doses. It also causes cough and angioedema but less often than
ACE inhibitors. As with ACE inhibitors and ARBs, aliskiren is contraindicated during pregnancy. Aliskiren is
metabolized by CYP3A4 and is subject to many drug interactions.

--- PAGE 631 ---

X.  Calcium Channel Blockers
Calcium channel blockers are a recommended first-line treatment option in black patients. They may also be useful
in hypertensive patients with diabetes or stable ischemic heart disease. High doses of short-acting calcium channel
blockers should be avoided because of increased risk of myocardial infarction due to excessive vasodilation and
marked reflex cardiac stimulation.
631
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 632 ---

A.  Classes of calcium channel blockers
The calcium channel blockers are divided into three chemical classes, each with different pharmacokinetic
properties and clinical indications (Figure 16.12).
Figure 16.12 Actions of calcium channel blockers. AV = atrioventricular.
1.  Diphenylalkylamines
Verapamil  [ver-AP-a-mil] is the only member of this class that is available in the United States. Verapamil  has
significant effects on both cardiac and vascular smooth muscle cells. It is also used to treat angina and
supraventricular tachyarrhythmias and to prevent migraine and cluster headaches.
632
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 633 ---

2.  Benzothiazepines
Diltiazem [dil-TYE-a-zem] is the only member of this class that is currently approved in the United States. Like
verapamil , diltiazem affects both cardiac and vascular smooth muscle cells, but it has a less pronounced negative
inotropic effect on the heart compared to that of verapamil . Diltiazem has a favorable side effect profile.
3.  Dihydropyridines
This class of calcium channel blockers includes nifedipine [nye-FED-i-peen] (the prototype), amlodipine [am-LOE-
di-peen], felodipine [fe-LOE-di-peen], isradipine [is-RAD-i-peen], nicardipine [nye-KAR-di-peen], and nisoldipine
[nye-ZOL-di-peen]. These agents differ in pharmacokinetics, approved uses, and drug interactions. All
dihydropyridines have a much greater affinity for vascular calcium channels than for calcium channels in the heart.
They are, therefore, particularly beneficial in treating hypertension. The dihydropyridines have the advantage in that
they show little interaction with other cardiovascular drugs, such as digoxin or warfarin, which are often used
concomitantly with calcium channel blockers.
633
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 634 ---

B.  Actions
The intracellular concentration of calcium plays an important role in maintaining the tone of smooth muscle and in
the contraction of the myocardium. Calcium channel antagonists block the inward movement of calcium by binding
to L-type calcium channels in the heart and in smooth muscle of the coronary and peripheral arteriolar vasculature.
This causes vascular smooth muscle to relax, dilating mainly arterioles. Calcium channel blockers do not dilate
veins.
634
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 635 ---

C.  Therapeutic uses
In the management of hypertension, CCBs may be used as an initial therapy or as add-on therapy. They are useful in
the treatment of hypertensive patients who also have asthma, diabetes, and/or peripheral vascular disease, because
unlike β-blockers, they do not have the potential to adversely affect these conditions. All CCBs are useful in the
treatment of angina. In addition, diltiazem and verapamil  are used in the treatment of atrial fibrillation.
635
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 636 ---

D.  Pharmacokinetics
Most of these agents have short half-lives (3 to 8 hours) following an oral dose. Sustained-release preparations are
available and permit once-daily dosing. Amlodipine has a very long half-life and does not require a sustained-release
formulation.
636
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 637 ---

E.  Adverse effects
First-degree atrioventricular block and constipation are common dose-dependent side effects of verapamil .
Verapamil  and diltiazem should be avoided in patients with heart failure or with atrioventricular block due to their
negative inotropic (force of cardiac muscle contraction) and dromotropic (velocity of conduction) effects. Dizziness,
headache, and a feeling of fatigue caused by a decrease in blood pressure are more frequent with dihydropyridines
(Figure 16.13). Peripheral edema is another commonly reported side effect of this class. Nifedipine and other
dihydropyridines may cause gingival hyperplasia.

XI.  α-ADRENOCEPTOR–BLOCKING AGENTS
α-Adrenergic blockers used in the treatment of hypertension include prazosin [PRA-zoe-sin], doxazosin [dox-AH-
zoe-sin], and terazosin [ter-AH-zoe-sin]. These agents produce a competitive block of α1-adrenoceptors. They
decrease peripheral vascular resistance and lower arterial blood pressure by causing relaxation of both arterial and
venous smooth muscle. These drugs cause only minimal changes in cardiac output, renal blood flow, and glomerular
filtration rate. Therefore, long-term tachycardia does not occur, but salt and water retention does. Reflex tachycardia
and postural hypotension often occur at the onset of treatment and with dose increases, requiring slow titration of the
drug in divided doses. Due to weaker outcome data and their side effect profile, α-blockers are no longer
recommended as initial treatment for hypertension but may be used for refractory cases. Other α1-blockers with
greater selectivity for the prostate are used in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (see Chapter 41).

--- PAGE 641 ---

XII.  a-/b-Adrenoceptor–blocking Agents
Labetalol  [la-BAY-ta-lol] and carvedilol  [kar-VE-di-lol] block α1, β1, and β2 receptors. Carvedilol  is indicated in the
treatment of heart failure and hypertension. It has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with
heart failure. Labetalol  is used in the management of gestational hypertension and hypertensive emergencies.

XIII.  Centrally Acting Adrenergic Drugs
642
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 643 ---

A.  Clonidine
Clonidine [KLON-i-deen] acts centrally as an α2 agonist to produce inhibition of sympathetic vasomotor centers,
decreasing sympathetic outflow to the periphery. This leads to reduced total peripheral resistance and decreased
blood pressure. Clonidine is used primarily for the treatment of hypertension that has not responded adequately to
treatment with two or more drugs. Clonidine does not decrease renal blood flow or glomerular filtration and,
therefore, is useful in the treatment of hypertension complicated by renal disease. Clonidine is well absorbed after
oral administration and is excreted by the kidney. It is also available in a transdermal patch. Adverse effects include
sedation, dry mouth, and constipation (Figure 16.14). Rebound hypertension occurs following abrupt withdrawal of
clonidine. The drug should, therefore, be withdrawn slowly if discontinuation is required.

--- PAGE 646 ---

B.  Methyldopa
Methyldopa [meth-ill-DOE-pa] is an α2 agonist that is converted to methylnorepinephrine centrally to diminish
adrenergic outflow from the CNS. The most common side effects of methyldopa are sedation and drowsiness. Its use
is limited due to adverse effects and the need for multiple daily doses. It is mainly used for management of
hypertension in pregnancy, where it has a record of safety.
646
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 647 ---

XIV.  Vasodilators
The direct-acting smooth muscle relaxants, such as hydralazine [hye-DRAL-a-zeen] and minoxidil  [min-OX-i-dill],
are not used as primary drugs to treat hypertension. These vasodilators act by producing relaxation of vascular
smooth muscle, primarily in arteries and arterioles. This results in decreased peripheral resistance and, therefore,
blood pressure. Both agents produce reflex stimulation of the heart, resulting in the competing reflexes of increased
myocardial contractility, heart rate, and oxygen consumption. These actions may prompt angina pectoris, myocardial
infarction, or cardiac failure in predisposed individuals. Vasodilators also increase plasma renin concentration,
resulting in sodium and water retention. These undesirable side effects can be blocked by concomitant use of a
diuretic (to decrease sodium retention) and a β-blocker (to balance the reflex tachycardia). Together, the three drugs
decrease cardiac output, plasma volume, and peripheral vascular resistance. Hydralazine is an accepted medication
for controlling blood pressure in pregnancy-induced hypertension. Adverse effects of hydralazine include headache,
tachycardia, nausea, sweating, arrhythmia, and precipitation of angina (Figure 16.15). A lupus-like syndrome can
occur with high dosages, but it is reversible upon discontinuation of the drug. Minoxidil  treatment causes
hypertrichosis (the growth of body hair). This drug is used topically to treat male pattern baldness.

XV.  Hypertensive Emergency
Hypertensive emergency is a rare but life-threatening situation characterized by severe elevations in blood pressure
(systolic greater than 180 mm Hg or diastolic greater than 120 mm Hg) with evidence of impending or progressive
target organ damage (for example, stroke, myocardial infarction). [Note: A severe elevation in blood pressure
without evidence of target organ damage is considered a hypertensive urgency.] Hypertensive emergencies require
timely blood pressure reduction with treatment administered intravenously to prevent or limit target organ damage.
A variety of medications are used, including calcium channel blockers (nicardipine and clevidipine), nitric oxide
vasodilators (nitroprusside and nitroglycerin), adrenergic receptor antagonists (phentolamine, esmolol , and
labetalol ), the vasodilator hydralazine, and the dopamine agonist fenoldopam. Treatment is directed by the type of
target organ damage and/or comorbidities present.

--- PAGE 651 ---

XVI.  Resistant Hypertension
Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure that remains elevated (above goal) despite administration of an
optimal three-drug regimen that includes a diuretic. The most common causes of resistant hypertension are poor
compliance, excessive ethanol intake, concomitant conditions (diabetes, obesity, sleep apnea, hyperaldosteronism,
high salt intake, and/or metabolic syndrome), concomitant medications (sympathomimetics, nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs, or corticosteroids), insufficient dose and/or drugs, and use of drugs with similar mechanisms of
action.

16.6Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
A 55-year-old non-Hispanic black male has hypertension. His past medical history also includes diabetes and
hyperlipidemia. According to the ACC/AHA guidelines, which among the choices represents the most
appropriate blood pressure goal for the patient?
A.  Less than 140/85
B.  Less than 135/85
C.  Less than 130/80
D.  Less than 140/80
Correct answer = C. Goals of therapy differ depending on which guidelines the clinician uses in practice.
According to the ACC/AHA guidelines the goal blood pressure for a diabetic patient is less than 130/80.
A 59-year-old non-Hispanic white patient presents for treatment of hypertension. His past medical history
also includes diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. The patient’s blood pressure is 150/93 (both today
and at the last visit). Which is a recommended initial therapy to treat hypertension in this patient?
A.  Enalapril
B.  Hydralazine
C.  Verapamil
D.  Metoprolol
Correct answer = A. Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor and is recommended for first-line therapy in various patient
populations, including those who have a compelling indication such as diabetes. The other therapies are not
considered first-line therapy.
A 45-year-old male complains of constipation. He was recently started on two antihypertensives due to
elevated systolic blood pressure (greater than 20 mm Hg above goal). His current medications include
lisinopril, chlorthalidone, verapamil, rosuvastatin, and aspirin. Which is most likely contributing to his
constipation?
A.  Chlorthalidone
B.  Verapamil
C.  Aspirin
D.  Lisinopril
Correct answer = B. Common side effects specific for verapamil include constipation and first-degree
atrioventricular block, which typically are dose-dependent. Electrolyte disturbances are often associated with both
diuretics (chlorthalidone) and ACE inhibitors (lisinopril).
Which antihypertensive medication can cause the rare side effect of angioedema?
A.  Amlodipine
B.  Fosinopril
C.  Prazosin
D.  Propranolol
Correct answer = B. ACE inhibitors (fosinopril), ARBs (for example, losartan), and renin inhibitors (aliskiren)
can cause angioedema. The occurrence of angioedema is more common with ACE inhibitors. Amlodipine can
cause dizziness, headache, and peripheral edema. Prazosin can cause reflex tachycardia and postural hypotension.
Propranolol can cause insomnia, decreased libido, fatigue, and bradycardia.
A 52-year-old female has uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure 154/82 mm Hg) on treatment with
lisinopril. She recently had a myocardial infarction and her past medical history includes diabetes,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis. Considering her compelling indications, which agent may
be appropriate to add to her antihypertensive therapy?
A.  Clonidine
B.  Olmesartan
C.  Furosemide
D.  Metoprolol
Correct answer = D. Individual patient care is warranted particularly in the case of a compelling indication for
certain medication. Considering her recent myocardial infarction, the best choice is a β1-blocker (metoprolol). It
is not appropriate to combine an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) and ARB (olmesartan). The other agents are not
considered first-line therapy and do not have a compelling indication for addition to the regimen.
The blood pressure of a patient with essential hypertension is at goal on treatment with enalapril. Since
initiation of enalapril, the serum creatinine has increased 25% above baseline. What is the appropriate next
step for the enalapril therapy?652

16.7
16.8
16.9
16.10A.  Discontinue enalapril.
B.  Reduce dose of enalapril.
C.  Continue current dose of enalapril.
D.  Increase dose of enalapril.
Correct answer = C. The blood pressure is at goal. Electrolytes (such as potassium) and serum creatinine should
be monitored in patients who initiate ACE inhibitors. Increases in serum creatinine up to 30% above baseline are
acceptable and do not warrant discontinuation or reduction of treatment. Since the blood pressure is at goal,
increasing the enalapril is not necessary.
Which of the following correctly outlines a major difference in electrolyte disturbances associated with
thiazide and loop diuretics?
A.  Thiazide diuretics decrease potassium and loop diuretics increase potassium.
B.  Thiazide diuretics increase potassium and loop diuretics decrease potassium.
C.  Thiazide diuretics decrease calcium and loop diuretics increase calcium.
D.  Thiazide diuretics increase calcium and loop diuretics decrease calcium.
Correct answer = D. Thiazide and loop diuretics decrease potassium, sodium and magnesium. However, thiazide
diuretics increase calcium (through reduced urinary excretion), while loop diuretics reduce calcium (through
enhanced urinary excretion).
Which can precipitate a hypertensive crisis following abrupt cessation of therapy?
A.  Clonidine
B.  Diltiazem
C.  Valsartan
D.  Hydrochlorothiazide
Correct answer = A. Increased sympathetic nervous system activity occurs if clonidine therapy is abruptly
stopped after prolonged administration. Uncontrolled elevation of blood pressure can occur. Patients should be
slowly weaned from clonidine while other antihypertensive medications are initiated. The other drugs on the list
do not produce this phenomenon.
Which of the following is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker?
A.  Amlodipine
B.  Metoprolol
C.  Verapamil
D.  Lisinopril
Correct answer = A. There are three classes of calcium channel blockers: nondihydropyridines (benzothiazepines,
diphenylalkylamines) and dihydropyridines. Amlodipine is a member of the dihydropyridine class of calcium
channel blockers, which also includes nifedipine and felodipine. Verapamil is a benzothiazepine calcium channel
blocker, metoprolol is a β-blocker, and lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor.
A 45-year-old man was started on therapy for hypertension and developed a persistent, dry cough. Which is
most likely responsible for this side effect?
A.  Lisinopril
B.  Losartan
C.  Nifedipine
D.  Atenolol
Correct answer = A. The cough is most likely an adverse effect of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril. Losartan is an
ARB that has the same beneficial effects as an ACE inhibitor but is less likely to produce a cough. Nifedipine and
atenolol do not cause this side effect.653

Diuretics
Zachary L. Cox
654
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 655 ---

I.  Overview
Diuretics are drugs that increase the volume of urine excreted. Most diuretic agents are inhibitors of renal ion
transporters that decrease the reabsorption of Na+ at different sites in the nephron. As a result, Na+ and other ions
enter the urine in greater than normal amounts along with water, which is carried passively to maintain osmotic
equilibrium. Diuretics, thus, increase the volume of urine and often change its pH, as well as the ionic composition
of the urine and blood. The diuretic effect of the different classes of diuretics varies considerably with the site of
action. In addition to the ion transport inhibitors, other types of diuretics include osmotic diuretics, aldosterone
antagonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. While diuretics are most commonly used for management of
excessive fluid retention (edema), many agents within this class are prescribed for non-diuretic indications or for
systemic effects in addition to their actions on the kidney. Examples, which are discussed below, include use of
thiazides in hypertension, use of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in glaucoma, and use of aldosterone antagonists in
heart failure. In this chapter, the diuretic drugs (Figure 17.1) are discussed according to the frequency of their use.

II.  Normal Regulation of Fluid and Electrolytes by the Kidneys
Approximately 16% to 20% of the blood plasma entering the kidneys is filtered from the glomerular capillaries into
Bowman's capsule. The filtrate, although normally free of proteins and blood cells, contains most of the low
molecular weight plasma components in concentrations similar to that in the plasma. These include glucose, sodium
bicarbonate, amino acids, and other organic solutes, as well as electrolytes, such as Na+, K+, and Cl−. The kidney
regulates the ionic composition and volume of urine by active reabsorption or secretion of ions and/or passive
reabsorption of water at five functional zones along the nephron: 1) the proximal convoluted tubule, 2) the
descending loop of Henle, 3) the ascending loop of Henle, 4) the distal convoluted tubule, and 5) the collecting
tubule and duct (Figure 17.2).

action of the diuretic drugs.

A.  Proximal convoluted tubule
In the proximal convoluted tubule located in the cortex of the kidney, almost all the glucose, bicarbonate, amino
acids, and other metabolites are reabsorbed (Figure 17.3). Approximately 65% of the filtered Na+ (and water) is
reabsorbed. Given the high water permeability, about 60% of water is reabsorbed from the lumen to the blood to
maintain osmolar equality. Chloride enters the lumen of the tubule in exchange for an anion, such as oxalate, as well
as paracellularly through the lumen. The Na+ that is reabsorbed is pumped into the interstitium by the Na+/K+-
adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) pump. Carbonic anhydrase in the luminal membrane and cytoplasm of the
proximal tubular cells modulates the reabsorption of bicarbonate. Despite having the highest percentage of filtered
Na+ that is reabsorbed, diuretics working in the proximal convoluted tubule display weak diuretic properties. The
presence of a high capacity Na+ and water reabsorption area (loop of Henle) distal to the proximal convoluted tubule
allows reabsorption of Na+ and water kept in the lumen by diuretics acting in the proximal convoluted tubule, and
limits effective diuresis.
Figure 17.3 Proximal convoluted tubule cell.
The proximal tubule is the site of the organic acid and base secretory systems. The organic acid secretory system,
located in the middle-third of the proximal tubule, secretes a variety of organic acids, such as uric acid, some
antibiotics, and diuretics, from the bloodstream into the proximal tubular lumen. The organic acid secretory system
is saturable, and diuretic drugs in the bloodstream compete for transfer with endogenous organic acids such as uric
acid. A number of other interactions can also occur. For example, probenecid interferes with penicillin secretion.
The organic base secretory system, located in the upper and middle segments of the proximal tubule, is responsible
for the secretion of creatinine and choline.

--- PAGE 658 ---

B.  Descending loop of Henle
The remaining filtrate, which is isotonic, next enters the descending limb of the loop of Henle and passes into the
medulla of the kidney. The osmolarity increases along the descending portion of the loop of Henle because of the
countercurrent mechanism that is responsible for water reabsorption. This results in a tubular fluid with a three-fold
increase in Na+ and Cl− concentration. Osmotic diuretics exert part of their action in this region.
658
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 659 ---

C.  Ascending loop of Henle
The cells of the ascending tubular epithelium are unique in being impermeable to water. Active reabsorption of Na+,
K+, and Cl− is mediated by a Na+/K+/2Cl− cotransporter (Figure 17.4). Both Mg2+ and Ca2+ are reabsorbed via the
paracellular pathway. Thus, the ascending loop dilutes the tubular fluid and raises the osmolarity of the medullary
interstitium. Approximately 25% to 30% of the filtered sodium chloride is absorbed here. Because the ascending
loop of Henle is a major site for salt reabsorption and no segments distally are capable of significant Na+ and water
reabsorption, drugs affecting this site, such as loop diuretics, have the greatest diuretic effect.
Figure 17.4 Ascending loop of Henle cell.
659

--- PAGE 660 ---

D.  Distal convoluted tubule
The cells of the distal convoluted tubule are also impermeable to water. About 5% to 10% of the filtered sodium
chloride is reabsorbed via a Na+/Cl− transporter, the target of thiazide diuretics. Calcium reabsorption, under the
regulation of parathyroid hormone, is mediated by an apical channel and then transported by a Na+/Ca2+-exchanger
into the interstitial fluid (Figure 17.5).
Figure 17.5 Distal convoluted tubule cell.
660
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 661 ---

E.  Collecting tubule and duct
The principal cells of the collecting tubule and duct are responsible for Na+, K+, and water transport, whereas the
intercalated cells affect H+ secretion (Figure 17.6). Approximately 1% to 2% of the filtered sodium enters the
principal cells through epithelial sodium channels that are inhibited by amiloride and triamterene. Once inside the
cell, Na+ reabsorption relies on a Na+/K+-ATPase pump to be transported into the blood. Aldosterone receptors in
the principal cells influence Na+ reabsorption and K+ secretion. Aldosterone increases the synthesis of epithelial
sodium channels and of the Na+/K+-ATPase pump to increase Na+ reabsorption and K+ excretion. Antidiuretic
hormone (ADH; vasopressin) binds to V2 receptors to promote the reabsorption of water through aquaporin
channels.

III.  Thiazides
The thiazides are the most widely used diuretics because of their antihypertensive effects. However, the efficacy of
thiazides for hypertension is not entirely dependent on their diuretic actions. These agents also reduce peripheral
vascular resistance with long-term therapy. Despite being sulfonamide derivatives, thiazides do not generally cause
hypersensitivity reactions in patients with allergies to sulfonamide antimicrobials such as sulfamethoxazole. All
thiazides affect the distal convoluted tubule (Figure 17.2), and all have equal maximum diuretic effects, differing
only in potency. Thiazides are sometimes called “low ceiling diuretics,” because increasing the dose above normal
therapeutic doses does not promote further diuretic response.
662
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 663 ---

A.  Thiazides
Chlorothiazide [klor-oh-THYE-ah-zide] was the first orally active thiazide, although hydrochlorothiazide [hye-dro-
klor-oh-THYE-ah-zide] and chlorthalidone [klor-THAL-i-done] are now used more commonly due to better
bioavailability. Hydrochlorothiazide is more potent, so the required dose is considerably lower than that of
chlorothiazide, but the efficacy is comparable to that of the parent drug. In all other aspects, hydrochlorothiazide
resembles chlorothiazide. Chlorthalidone is approximately twice as potent as hydrochlorothiazide. Chlorthalidone,
indapamide [in-DAP-a-mide], and metolazone [me-TOL-ah-zone] are referred to as thiazide-like diuretics because
they lack the characteristic benzothiadiazine chemical structure; however, their mechanism of action, indications,
and adverse effects are similar to those of hydrochlorothiazide.
1.  Mechanism of action
The thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics act mainly in the distal convoluted tubule to decrease the reabsorption of Na+
by inhibition of a Na+/Cl− cotransporter (Figure 17.5). As a result, these drugs increase the concentration of Na+ and
Cl− in the tubular fluid. Thiazides must be excreted into the tubular lumen at the proximal convoluted tubule to be
effective (Figure 17.3). Therefore, decreasing renal function reduces the diuretic effects. The antihypertensive
effects of thiazides may persist even when the glomerular filtration rate is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. However,
hypertension at this level of renal dysfunction is often exacerbated by hypervolemia, requiring a change to loop
diuretics for volume status and, therefore, blood pressure control. The efficacy of thiazides may be diminished with
concomitant use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as indomethacin, which inhibit production
of renal prostaglandins, thereby reducing renal blood flow.
2.  Actions
a.  Increased excretion of Na+ and Cl−
Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics cause diuresis with increased Na+ and Cl− excretion, which can result in the
excretion of very hyperosmolar (concentrated) urine. This latter effect is unique, as the other diuretic classes are
unlikely to produce a hyperosmolar urine. Figure 17.7 outlines relative changes in the ionic composition of the urine
with thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics.
Figure 17.7 Urinary excretion from diuretic therapy.
b.  Decreased urinary calcium excretion
Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics decrease the Ca2+ content of urine by promoting the reabsorption of Ca2+ in the
distal convoluted tubule where parathyroid hormone regulates reabsorption.
c.  Reduced peripheral vascular resistance
An initial reduction in blood pressure results from a decrease in blood volume and, therefore, a decrease in cardiac
output. With continued therapy, blood volume returns to baseline. However, antihypertensive effects continue,
resulting from reduced peripheral vascular resistance caused by relaxation of arteriolar smooth muscle.
3.  Therapeutic uses
a.  Hypertension
Clinically, thiazides are a mainstay of antihypertensive treatment, because they are inexpensive, convenient to
663
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 664 ---

administer, and well tolerated. Blood pressure can be lowered with a daily dose of thiazide. At doses equipotent to
hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone is considered a preferred option by some clinicians because of its longer half-
life (50 to 60 hours) and improved control of blood pressure over the entire day. However, current treatment
guidelines for hypertension do not recommend any thiazide preferentially.
b.  Heart failure
Loop diuretics (not thiazides) are the diuretics of choice in reducing extracellular volume in heart failure. However,
thiazide diuretics may be added in patients resistant to loop diuretics, with careful monitoring for hypokalemia.
Metolazone is most frequently utilized as an addition to loop diuretics, although there is a lack of evidence that it is
more effective than other thiazides for this indication when administered at equipotent doses. Historically, thiazides
were prescribed to be administered 30 minutes prior to loop diuretics to allow the thiazide time to reach the site of
action when combined to augment diuresis in diuretic resistance. This practice is unnecessary and not supported by
current evidence.
c.  Hypercalciuria
The thiazides can be useful in treating idiopathic hypercalciuria and calcium oxalate stones in the urinary tract,
because they inhibit urinary Ca2+ excretion.
d.  Diabetes insipidus
Thiazides have the unique ability to produce a hyperosmolar urine. Thiazides can be utilized as a treatment for
nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. The urine volume of such individuals may drop from 11 to about 3 L/d when treated
with thiazides.
4.  Pharmacokinetics
As a class, thiazides are effective orally, with a bioavailability of 60% to 70%. Chlorothiazide has a much lower
bioavailability (15% to 30%) and is the only thiazide with an intravenous dosage form. Most thiazides take 1 to 3
weeks to produce a stable reduction in blood pressure and exhibit a prolonged half-life (approximately 10 to 15
hours). Indapamide differs from the class because it undergoes hepatic metabolism and is excreted in both the urine
and bile. Most thiazides are primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.
5.  Adverse effects
These mainly involve problems in fluid and electrolyte balance (Figure 17.8).
664
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 665 ---

Figure 17.8 Summary of adverse effects commonly observed with thiazide and thiazide-
like medications.
a.  Hypokalemia
665
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 666 ---

Hypokalemia is the most frequent problem with the thiazide diuretics. Because thiazides increase Na+ in the filtrate
arriving at the distal tubule, more K+ is also exchanged for Na+, resulting in a continual loss of K+ from the body
with prolonged use of these drugs Thus, serum K+ should be measured periodically (more frequently at the
beginning of therapy) to monitor for the development of hypokalemia. Potassium supplementation or combination
with a potassium-sparing diuretic may be required. Low-sodium diets blunt the potassium depletion caused by
thiazide diuretics.
b.  Hypomagnesemia
Urinary loss of magnesium can lead to hypomagnesemia.
c.  Hyponatremia
Hyponatremia may develop due to elevation of ADH, as well as diminished diluting capacity of the kidney and
increased thirst.
d.  Hyperuricemia
Thiazides increase serum uric acid by decreasing the amount of acid excreted through competition in the organic
acid secretory system. Being insoluble, uric acid deposits in the joints and may precipitate a gouty attack in
predisposed individuals. Therefore, thiazides should be used with caution in patients with gout or high levels of uric
acid.
e.  Hypovolemia
This can cause orthostatic hypotension or light-headedness.
f.  Hypercalcemia
Thiazides inhibit the secretion of Ca2+, sometimes leading to hypercalcemia (elevated levels of Ca2+ in the blood).
g.  Hyperglycemia
Therapy with thiazides can lead to mild elevations in serum glucose, possibly due to impaired release of insulin
related to hypokalemia. Patients with diabetes still benefit from thiazide therapy, but should monitor glucose to
assess the need for an adjustment in diabetes therapy if thiazides are initiated.

IV.  Loop Diuretics
Bumetanide [byoo-MET-ah-nide], furosemide [fur-OH-se-mide], torsemide [TOR-se-mide], and ethacrynic [eth-a-
KRIN-ik] acid have their major diuretic action on the ascending limb of the loop of Henle (Figure 17.2). Of all the
diuretics, these drugs have the highest efficacy in mobilizing Na+ and Cl− from the body, producing copious
amounts of urine. Similar to thiazides, loop diuretics do not generally cause hypersensitivity reactions in patients
with allergies to sulfonamide antimicrobials such as sulfamethoxazole because of structural differences in their
sulfonamide derivative. Furosemide is the most commonly used of these drugs. The use of bumetanide and
torsemide is increasing, as these agents have better bioavailability and are more potent compared to furosemide.
Ethacrynic acid is used infrequently due to its adverse effect profile.
667
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 668 ---

A.  Bumetanide, furosemide, torsemide, and ethacrynic acid
1.  Mechanism of action
Loop diuretics inhibit the cotransport of Na+/K+/2Cl− in the luminal membrane in the ascending limb of the loop of
Henle (Figure 17.4). Therefore, reabsorption of these ions into the renal medulla is decreased. By lowering the
osmotic pressure in the medulla, less water is reabsorbed from water permeable segments, like the descending loop
of Henle, causing diuresis. These agents have the greatest diuretic effect of all the diuretics because the ascending
limb accounts for reabsorption of 25% to 30% of filtered NaCl and downstream sites are unable to compensate for
the increased Na+ load. Loop diuretics must be excreted into the tubular lumen at the proximal convoluted tubule to
be effective (Figure 17.3). NSAIDs inhibit renal prostaglandin synthesis and can reduce the diuretic action of loop
diuretics.
2.  Actions
a.  Diuresis
Loop diuretics cause diuresis, even in patients with poor renal function or lack of response to other diuretics.
Changes in the composition of the urine induced by loop diuretics are shown in Figure 17.7.
Loop diuretics display a sigmoidal (“S”-shaped) dose-response curve with three parts: a threshold effect, a rapid
increase in diuresis with small changes in drug concentration, and a ceiling effect ( Figure 17.9). A dose must be
selected to cross the response threshold, which is patient-specific. Reducing the effective dose with the intent of a
reduction in diuresis can result in no diuresis, if the concentration of loop diuretic drops below the response
threshold. Likewise, increasing the effective dose may not cause more diuresis because of the ceiling effect. Thus,
after determination of an effective diuretic dose, the clinician should modify the frequency of administration to
increase or decrease the daily diuresis.
Figure 17.9 Loop diuretic dose-response curve.
b.  Increased urinary calcium excretion
Unlike thiazides, loop diuretics increase the Ca2+ content of urine. In patients with normal serum Ca2+
concentrations, hypocalcemia does not result, because Ca2+ is reabsorbed in the distal convoluted tubule.
c.  Venodilation
Prior to their diuretic actions, loop diuretics cause acute venodilation and reduce left ventricular filling pressures via
enhanced prostaglandin synthesis.
3.  Therapeutic uses
a.  Edema
Loop diuretics are the drugs of choice for treatment of pulmonary edema and acute/chronic peripheral edema caused
from heart failure or renal impairment. Because of their rapid onset of action, particularly when given intravenously,
668
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 669 ---

the drugs are useful in emergency situations such as acute pulmonary edema.
b.  Hypercalcemia
Loop diuretics (along with hydration) are also useful in treating hypercalcemia, because they stimulate tubular Ca2+
excretion.
c.  Hyperkalemia
Loop diuretics can be used with or without replacement intravenous fluid for the treatment of hyperkalemia.
4.  Pharmacokinetics
Loop diuretics are administered orally or parenterally. Furosemide has unpredictable bioavailability of 10% to 90%
after oral administration. Bumetanide and torsemide have reliable bioavailability of 80% to 100%, which makes
these agents preferred for oral therapy. The duration of action is approximately 6 hours for furosemide and
bumetanide, and moderately longer for torsemide, allowing patients to predict the window of diuresis.
5.  Effects
Fluid and electrolyte issues are the predominant adverse effects (Figure 17.10).
669
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 670 ---

Figure 17.10 Summary of adverse effects commonly observed with loop diuretics.
a.  Acute hypovolemia
670
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 671 ---

Loop diuretics can cause a severe and rapid reduction in blood volume, with the possibility of hypotension, shock,
and cardiac arrhythmias.
b.  Hypokalemia
The heavy load of Na+ presented to the collecting tubule results in increased exchange of tubular Na+ for K+, leading
to hypokalemia, the most common adverse effect of the loop diuretics. The loss of K+ from cells in exchange for H+
leads to hypokalemic alkalosis. Use of potassium-sparing diuretics or supplementation with K+ can prevent the
development of hypokalemia.
c.  Hypomagnesemia
Urinary loss of magnesium can lead to hypomagnesemia.
d.  Ototoxicity
Reversible or permanent hearing loss may occur with loop diuretics, particularly when infused intravenously at fast
rates, at high doses, or when used in conjunction with other ototoxic drugs (for example, aminoglycoside
antibiotics). With current dosing and appropriate infusion rates, ototoxicity is a rare occurrence. Ethacrynic acid is
the most likely to cause ototoxicity. Although less common, vestibular function may also be affected, inducing
vertigo.
e.  Hyperuricemia
Loop diuretics compete with uric acid for the renal secretory systems, thus blocking its secretion and, in turn, may
cause or exacerbate gouty attacks.
671
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 672 ---

V.  Potassium-Sparing Diuretics
Potassium-sparing diuretics act in the collecting tubule to inhibit Na+ reabsorption and K+ excretion (Figure 17.6).
Potassium levels must be monitored in patients treated with potassium-sparing diuretics. These drugs should be used
cautiously in moderate renal dysfunction and avoided in patients with severe renal dysfunction because of the
increased risk of hyperkalemia. Within this class, there are drugs with two distinct mechanisms of action with
different indications for use: aldosterone antagonists and epithelial sodium channel blockers. Changes in the
composition of the urine induced by potassium-sparing diuretics are shown in Figure 17.7.
672
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 673 ---

A.  Aldosterone antagonists: spironolactone and eplerenone
1.  Mechanism of action
Spironolactone [spear-oh-no-LAK-tone] and eplerenone [eh-PLEH-reh-none] are synthetic steroids that antagonize
aldosterone receptors. This prevents translocation of the receptor complex into the nucleus of the target cell,
ultimately resulting in a lack of intracellular proteins that stimulate the Na+/K+-exchange sites of the collecting
tubule. Thus, aldosterone antagonists prevent Na+ reabsorption and, therefore, K+ and H+ secretion. Eplerenone is
more selective for aldosterone receptors and causes less endocrine effects (gynecomastia) than spironolactone,
which also binds to progesterone and androgen receptors.
2.  Actions
Spironolactone and eplerenone antagonize aldosterone receptors at renal sites, which causes diuresis, and nonrenal
sites, which causes other effects. In most edematous states, blood levels of aldosterone are high, causing retention of
Na+. Spironolactone antagonizes the activity of aldosterone, resulting in retention of K+ and excretion of Na+.
3.  Therapeutic uses
a.  Edema
Aldosterone antagonists are particularly effective diuretics when used in high doses for edema associated with
secondary hyperaldosteronism, such as hepatic cirrhosis and nephrotic syndrome. Spironolactone is the diuretic of
choice in patients with hepatic cirrhosis with fluid in the peritoneal cavity (ascites). By contrast, in patients who
have no significant circulating levels of aldosterone, there is minimal diuretic effect with use of this drug.
b.  Hypokalemia
Although the aldosterone antagonists have a low efficacy in mobilizing Na+ from the body in comparison with the
other diuretics, they have the useful property of causing the retention of K+. These agents are often given in
conjunction with thiazide or loop diuretics to prevent K+ excretion that occurs with those diuretics.
c.  Heart failure
Aldosterone antagonists are employed at lower doses to prevent myocardial remodeling mediated by aldosterone.
Use of these agents has been shown to decrease mortality associated with heart failure, particularly in those with
reduced ejection fraction.
d.  Resistant hypertension
Resistant hypertension, defined by the use of three or more medications without reaching the blood pressure goal,
often responds well to aldosterone antagonists. This effect can be seen in those with or without elevated aldosterone
levels.
e.  Polycystic ovary syndrome
Spironolactone is often used off-label for the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome. It blocks androgen receptors
and inhibits steroid synthesis at high doses, thereby helping to offset increased androgen levels seen in this disorder.
4.  Pharmacokinetics
Both spironolactone and eplerenone are well absorbed after oral administration. S pironolactone is extensively
metabolized and converted to several active metabolites, which contribute to the therapeutic effects. Eplerenone is
metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4.
5.  Adverse effects
a.  Hyperkalemia
The most common side effect, hyperkalemia, is dose-dependent and increases with renal dysfunction or use of other
potassium-sparing agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and potassium supplements.
b.  Gynecomastia
Spironolactone, but not eplerenone, may induce gynecomastia in approximately 10% of male patients and menstrual
irregularities in female patients.
673
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 674 ---

B.  Triamterene and amiloride
Triamterene [trye-AM-ter-een] and amiloride [a-MIL-oh-ride] block epithelial sodium channels, resulting in a
decrease in Na+/K+ exchange. Although they have a K+-sparing diuretic action similar to that of the aldosterone
antagonists, their ability to block the Na+/K+-exchange site in the collecting tubule does not depend on the presence
of aldosterone. Like the aldosterone antagonists, these agents are not very efficacious diuretics. Both triamterene
and amiloride are commonly used in combination with other diuretics, almost solely for their potassium-sparing
properties.
674
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 675 ---

VI.  Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitor
Acetazolamide [ah-set-a-ZOLE-a-mide] and other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are more often used for their other
pharmacologic actions than for their diuretic effect, because they are much less efficacious than the thiazide or loop
diuretics.
675
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 676 ---

A.  Acetazolamide
1.  Mechanism of action
Acetazolamide inhibits carbonic anhydrase located intracellularly (cytoplasm) and on the apical membrane of the
proximal tubular epithelium (Figure 17.3). [Note: Carbonic anhydrase catalyzes the reaction of CO2 and H2O,
leading to H2CO3, which spontaneously ionizes to H+ and HCO3− (bicarbonate).] The decreased ability to exchange
Na+ for H+ in the presence of acetazolamide results in a mild diuresis. Additionally, HCO3− is retained in the lumen,
with marked elevation in urinary pH. The loss of HCO3− causes a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Changes in
the composition of urinary electrolytes induced by acetazolamide are summarized in Figure 17.7.
2.  Therapeutic uses
a.  Glaucoma
Oral acetazolamide decreases the production of aqueous humor and reduces intraocular pressure in patients with
chronic open-angle glaucoma, probably by blocking carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary body of the eye. Topical
carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, such as dorzolamide and brinzolamide, have the advantage of not causing systemic
effects.
b.  Altitude sickness
Acetazolamide can be used in the prophylaxis of symptoms of altitude sickness. Acetazolamide prevents weakness,
breathlessness, dizziness, nausea, and cerebral as well as pulmonary edema characteristic of the syndrome.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
Acetazolamide can be administered orally or intravenously. It is approximately 90% protein bound and eliminated
renally by both active tubular secretion and passive reabsorption.
4.  Adverse effects
Metabolic acidosis (mild), potassium depletion, renal stone formation, drowsiness, and paresthesia may occur. The
drug should be avoided in patients with hepatic cirrhosis, because it could lead to a decreased excretion of NH4+.
676

--- PAGE 677 ---

VII.  Osmotic Diuretics
A number of simple, hydrophilic chemical substances that are filtered through the glomerulus, such as mannitol
[MAN-i-tol], result in diuresis (Figure 17.2). Filtered substances that undergo little or no reabsorption result in a
higher osmolarity of the tubular fluid. This prevents further water reabsorption at the descending loop of Henle and
proximal convoluted tubule, resulting in osmotic diuresis with little additional Na+ excretion (aquaresis). Therefore,
these agents are not useful for treating conditions in which Na+ retention occurs. They are used to maintain urine
flow following acute toxic ingestion of substances capable of producing acute renal failure. Osmotic diuretics are a
mainstay of treatment for patients with increased intracranial pressure. [Note: Mannitol  is not absorbed when given
orally and should be given intravenously.] Adverse effects include dehydration and extracellular water expansion
from the osmotic effects in the systemic circulation. The expansion of extracellular water occurs because the
presence of mannitol  in the extracellular fluid extracts water from the cells and causes hyponatremia until diuresis
occurs.

Correct answer = D. Spironolactone is very effective in the treatment of hepatic edema. These patients are
frequently resistant to the diuretic action of loop diuretics, although a combination with spironolactone may be
beneficial. The other agents are not indicated.
A 55-year-old male with kidney stones needs a medication to decrease urinary calcium excretion. Which
diuretic is best for this indication?
A.  Torsemide
B.  Hydrochlorothiazide
C.  Spironolactone
D.  Triamterene
Correct answer = B. Hydrochlorothiazide is effective in increasing calcium reabsorption, thus decreasing the
amount of calcium excreted, and decreasing the formation of kidney stones that contain calcium phosphate or
calcium oxalate. Furosemide increases the excretion of calcium, whereas the K+-sparing diuretics, spironolactone,
and triamterene do not have an effect.
A 75-year-old woman with hypertension and glaucoma is being treated with chlorthalidone, amlodipine,
lisinopril, and acetazolamide. In clinic today, she complains of acute joint pain and redness in her great toe,
which is diagnosed as gout. Which medication is most likely to have caused the gout attack?
A.  Amlodipine
B.  Acetazolamide
C.  Chlorthalidone
D.  Lisinopril
Correct answer = C. Thiazides such as chlorthalidone compete with uric acid for secretion into the lumen of the
nephron at the proximal convoluted tubule. This competition decreases uric acid secretion, raising the serum
concentration and increasing the risk of a gout attack. Loop diuretics have the same risk.
Which is contraindicated in a patient with hyperkalemia?
A.  Acetazolamide
B.  Chlorothiazide
C.  Ethacrynic acid
D.  Eplerenone678

17.7
17.8
17.9
17.10Correct answer = D. Eplerenone acts in the collecting tubule via aldosterone antagonism to inhibit Na+
reabsorption and K+ excretion. It is extremely important that patients who are treated with any potassium-sparing
diuretic be closely monitored for potassium levels. Exogenous potassium supplementation is usually discontinued
when potassium-sparing diuretic therapy is initiated. The other drugs promote the excretion of potassium.
A 59-year-old male patient in the intensive care unit has a metabolic alkalosis. Which therapy will treat this
condition?
A.  Amiloride
B.  Hydrochlorothiazide
C.  Mannitol
D.  Acetazolamide
Correct answer = D. Acetazolamide causes an increase in the urinary excretion of bicarbonate, lowering the pH of
the blood.
A male patient is placed on a new medication and notes that his breasts have become enlarged and tender to
the touch. Which medication is the most likely taking?
A.  Furosemide
B.  Hydrochlorothiazide
C.  Spironolactone
D.  Triamterene
Correct answer = C. An adverse drug reaction to spironolactone is gynecomastia due to its effects on androgens
and progesterone in the body. Eplerenone may be a suitable alternative if the patient is in need of an aldosterone
antagonist but has a history of gynecomastia.
A patient with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction researched his medications on the Internet and
found he was taking two “diuretics,” bumetanide and spironolactone. He asks if this is a mistake with his
therapy. What is the best response?
A.  Spironolactone is used to prevent hyponatremia.
B.  Spironolactone is used to reduce heart structure changes and decrease the risk of death.
C.  Bumetanide is used to decrease the potassium lost from spironolactone therapy.
D.  This is a duplication error and one diuretic should be stopped.
Correct answer = B. Aldosterone antagonists are used at non-diuretic doses in heart failure to prevent myocardial
remodeling and decrease mortality. Bumetanide is used as a diuretic to treat edema from heart failure. Both are
appropriate to use together because of the unique indications. Spironolactone reduces the potassium lost from
diuresis with bumetanide.
Which diuretic has been shown to improve blood pressure in resistant hypertension or those already treated
with three blood pressure medications including a thiazide or thiazide-like medication?
A.  Indapamide
B.  Furosemide
C.  Mannitol
D.  Spironolactone
Correct answer = D. Resistant hypertension, defined by the use of three or more medications without reaching the
blood pressure goal, often responds well to aldosterone antagonists. This effect can be seen in those with or
without elevated aldosterone levels.679

I.  Overview
Heart failure (HF) is a complex, progressive disorder in which the heart is unable to pump sufficient blood to meet
the needs of the body. Its cardinal symptoms are dyspnea, fatigue, and fluid retention. HF is due to an impaired
ability of the heart to adequately fill with and/or eject blood. It is often accompanied by abnormal increases in blood
volume and interstitial fluid. Underlying causes of HF include, but are not limited to, atherosclerotic heart disease,
hypertensive heart disease, valvular heart disease, and congenital heart disease.
681

--- PAGE 682 ---

A.  Role of physiologic compensatory mechanisms in the
progression of HF
Chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) is
associated with remodeling of cardiac tissue, loss of myocytes, hypertrophy, and fibrosis. This prompts additional
neurohormonal activation, creating a vicious cycle that, if left untreated, leads to death.
682
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 683 ---

B.  Goals of pharmacologic intervention in HF
Goals of treatment are to alleviate symptoms, slow disease progression, and improve survival. The following classes
of drugs have been shown to be effective: 1) angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, 2) angiotensin
receptor blockers, 3) aldosterone antagonists, 4) β-blockers, 5) diuretics, 6) direct vaso- and venodilators, 7)
hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel blockers, 8) inotropic agents, 9) the combination of a
neprilysin inhibitor with an angiotensin receptor blocker, and 10) recombinant B-type natriuretic peptide (Figure
18.1). Depending on the severity of HF and individual patient factors, one or more of these classes of drugs are
administered. Pharmacologic intervention provides the following benefits in HF: reduced myocardial work load,
decreased extracellular fluid volume, improved cardiac contractility, and a reduced rate of cardiac remodeling.
Knowledge of the physiology of cardiac muscle contraction is essential for understanding the compensatory
responses evoked by the failing heart, as well as the actions of drugs used to treat HF.

II.  Physiology of Muscle Contraction
The myocardium, like smooth and skeletal muscle, responds to stimulation by depolarization of the membrane,
which is followed by shortening of the contractile proteins and ends with relaxation and return to the resting state
(repolarization). Cardiac myocytes are interconnected in groups that respond to stimuli as a unit, contracting
together whenever a single cell is stimulated.
686
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 687 ---

A.  Action potential
Cardiac myocytes are electrically excitable and have a spontaneous, intrinsic rhythm generated by specialized
“pacemaker” cells located in the sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) nodes. Cardiac myocytes also have an
unusually long action potential, which can be divided into five phases (0 to 4). Figure 18.2 illustrates the major ions
contributing to depolarization and repolarization of cardiac myocytes.
Figure 18.2 Action potential of a cardiac myocyte. ATPase = adenosine triphosphatase.
687
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 688 ---

B.  Cardiac contraction
The force of contraction of the cardiac muscle is directly related to the concentration of free (unbound) cytosolic
calcium. Therefore, agents that increase intracellular calcium levels (or that increase the sensitivity of the contractile
machinery to calcium) increase the force of contraction (inotropic effect). The movement of calcium in cardiac
myocytes is illustrated in Figure 18.3.

adenosine triphosphatase.

--- PAGE 689 ---

C.  Compensatory physiological responses in HF
The failing heart evokes four major compensatory mechanisms to enhance cardiac output (Figure 18.4).
689
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 690 ---

Figure 18.4 Cardiovascular consequences of HF.
1.  Increased sympathetic activity
Baroreceptors sense a decrease in blood pressure and activate the sympathetic nervous system. In an attempt to
sustain tissue perfusion, this stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors results in an increased heart rate and a greater
force of contraction of the heart muscle. In addition, vasoconstriction enhances venous return and increases cardiac
preload. An increase in preload (stretch on the heart) increases stroke volume, which, in turn, increases cardiac
output. These compensatory responses increase the workload of the heart, which, in the long term, contributes to
further decline in cardiac function.
2.  Activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS)
A fall in cardiac output decreases blood flow to the kidney, prompting the release of renin. Renin release is also
stimulated by increased sympathetic activity resulting in increased formation of angiotensin II and release of690
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 691 ---

aldosterone. This results in increased peripheral resistance (afterload) and retention of sodium and water. Blood
volume increases, and more blood is returned to the heart. If the heart is unable to pump this extra volume, venous
pressure increases and peripheral and pulmonary edema occur. In addition, high levels of angiotensin II and
aldosterone have direct detrimental effects on cardiac muscle, favoring remodeling, fibrosis, and inflammatory
changes. Again, these compensatory responses increase the workload of the heart, contributing to further decline in
cardiac function.
3.  Activation of natriuretic peptides
An increase in preload also increases the release of natriuretic peptides. Natriuretic peptides, which include atrial, B-
type, and C-type, have differing roles in HF; atrial and B-type natriuretic peptides are the most important. Activation
of the natriuretic peptides ultimately results in vasodilation, natriuresis, inhibition of renin and aldosterone release,
and a reduction in myocardial fibrosis. This beneficial response may improve cardiac function and HF symptoms.
4.  Myocardial hypertrophy
Initially, stretching of the heart muscle leads to a stronger contraction of the heart. However, excessive elongation of
the fibers results in weaker contractions and a diminished ability to eject blood. This type of failure is termed
“systolic failure” or HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and is the result of the ventricle being unable to
pump effectively. Patients with HF may have “diastolic dysfunction,” a term applied when the ability of the
ventricles to relax and accept blood is impaired by structural changes such as hypertrophy. The thickening of the
ventricular wall and subsequent decrease in ventricular volume decrease the ability of heart muscle to relax. In this
case, the ventricle does not fill adequately, and the inadequacy of cardiac output is termed “diastolic HF” or HF with
preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Diastolic dysfunction, in its pure form, is characterized by signs and symptoms
of HF in the presence of a normal functioning left ventricle. However, both systolic and diastolic dysfunction
commonly coexist in HF.
691
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 692 ---

D.  Acute (decompensated) HF
If the compensatory mechanisms adequately restore cardiac output, HF is said to be compensated. If the
compensatory mechanisms fail to maintain cardiac output, HF is decompensated and the patient develops worsening
HF signs and symptoms. Typical HF signs and symptoms include dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, fatigue, and peripheral edema.
692
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 693 ---

E.  Therapeutic strategies in HF
Chronic HF is typically managed by fluid limitations (less than 1.5 to 2 L daily); low dietary intake of sodium (less
than 2000 mg/d); treatment of comorbid conditions; and judicious use of diuretics. Specifically for HFrEF, inhibitors
of the RAAS, inhibitors of the sympathetic nervous system, and drugs that enhance activity of natriuretic peptides
have been shown to improve survival and reduce symptoms. Inotropic agents are reserved for acute signs and
symptoms of HF and are used mostly in the inpatient setting. Drugs that may precipitate or exacerbate HF, such as
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), alcohol, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and some
antiarrhythmic drugs, should be avoided if possible.
693
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 694 ---

III.  Inhibitors of the Renin–Angiotensin–Aldosterone System
The compensatory activation of the RAAS in HF leads to increased workload on the heart and a resultant decline in
cardiac function. Therefore, inhibition of the RAAS is an important pharmacological target in the management of
HF.
694
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 695 ---

A.  Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are a part of standard pharmacotherapy in HFrEF. These drugs
block the enzyme that cleaves angiotensin I to form the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. They also diminish the
inactivation of bradykinin (Figure 18.5).
Figure 18.5 Effects of ACE inhibitors. [Note: The reduced retention of sodium and water
results from two causes: decreased production of angiotensin II and aldosterone.]
1.  Actions
ACE inhibitors decrease vascular resistance (afterload) and venous tone (preload), resulting in increased cardiac
output. ACE inhibitors also blunt the usual angiotensin II–mediated increase in epinephrine and aldosterone seen in
HF. ACE inhibitors improve clinical signs and symptoms of HF and have been shown to significantly improve
patient survival in HF.
2.  Therapeutic use
ACE inhibitors may be considered for patients with asymptomatic and symptomatic HFrEF. Importantly, ACE
inhibitors are indicated for patients with all stages of left ventricular failure. These agents should be started at low
doses and titrated to target or maximally tolerated doses in the management of HFrEF. ACE inhibitors are also used
in the treatment of hypertension (see Chapter 16). Patients who have had a recent myocardial infarction or are at
high risk for a cardiovascular event also benefit from long-term ACE inhibitor therapy.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
ACE inhibitors are adequately absorbed following oral administration. Food may decrease the absorption of
captopril  [KAP-toe-pril], so it should be taken on an empty stomach. Except for captopril  and injectable enalaprilat
[en-AL-a-pril-at], ACE inhibitors are prodrugs that require activation by hydrolysis via hepatic enzymes. Renal
elimination of the active moiety is important for most ACE inhibitors except fosinopril  [foe-SIN-oh-pril], which also
undergoes excretion in the feces. Plasma half-lives of active compounds vary from 2 to 12 hours, although the
inhibition of ACE may be much longer.
4.  Adverse effects
These include postural hypotension, renal insufficiency, hyperkalemia, a persistent dry cough, and angioedema
(rare). Because of the risk of hyperkalemia, potassium levels must be monitored, particularly with concurrent use of
potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, or aldosterone antagonists. Serum creatinine levels should also
be monitored, particularly in patients with underlying renal disease. The potential for symptomatic hypotension with
ACE inhibitors is much more common if used concomitantly with a diuretic. ACE inhibitors are teratogenic and
should not be used in pregnant women. Please see Chapter 16 for a full discussion of ACE inhibitors.
695
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 696 ---

B.  Angiotensin receptor blockers
Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are orally active compounds that are competitive antagonists of the
angiotensin II type 1 receptor. Because ACE inhibitors inhibit only one enzyme responsible for the production of
angiotensin II, ARBs have the advantage of more complete blockade of the actions of angiotensin II. However,
ARBs do not affect bradykinin levels. Although ARBs have actions similar to those of ACE inhibitors, they are not
therapeutically identical. Even so, ARBs are a substitute for patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors.
1.  Actions
Although ARBs have a different mechanism of action than ACE inhibitors, their actions on preload and afterload are
similar. Their use in HF is mainly as a substitute in patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors due to cough or
angioedema, which are thought to be mediated by elevated bradykinin levels. ARBs are also used in the treatment of
hypertension (see Chapter 16).
2.  Pharmacokinetics
ARBs are orally active and are dosed once daily, with the exception of valsartan [val-SAR-tan], which is dosed
twice daily. They are highly plasma protein bound. Losartan [loe-SAR-tan] differs in that it undergoes extensive
first-pass hepatic metabolism, including conversion to an active metabolite. The other drugs have inactive
metabolites. Elimination of metabolites and parent compounds occurs in urine and feces.
3.  Adverse effects
ARBs have an adverse effect and drug interaction profile similar to that of ACE inhibitors. However, the ARBs have
a lower incidence of cough and angioedema. Like ACE inhibitors, ARBs are contraindicated in pregnancy.
696

--- PAGE 697 ---

C.  Aldosterone receptor antagonists
Patients with HF have elevated levels of aldosterone due to angiotensin II stimulation and reduced hepatic clearance
of the hormone. Spironolactone [spir-ON-oh-LAK-tone] and eplerenone [ep-LER-e-none] are antagonists of
aldosterone at the mineralocorticoid receptor, thereby preventing salt retention, myocardial hypertrophy, and
hypokalemia. Spironolactone also has affinity for androgen and progesterone receptors, and is associated with
endocrine-related adverse effects such as gynecomastia and dysmenorrhea. Aldosterone antagonists are indicated in
patients with symptomatic HFrEF or HFrEF and recent myocardial infarction. Please see Chapter 17 for a full
discussion of aldosterone receptor antagonists.
697
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 698 ---

IV.  β-Blockers
Although it may seem counterintuitive to administer drugs with negative inotropic activity in HF, evidence clearly
demonstrates improved systolic function and reverse cardiac remodeling in patients receiving β-blockers. These
benefits arise in spite of an occasional, initial exacerbation of symptoms. The benefit of β-blockers is attributed, in
part, to their ability to prevent the changes that occur because of chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous
system. These agents decrease heart rate and inhibit release of renin in the kidneys. In addition, β-blockers prevent
the deleterious effects of norepinephrine on the cardiac muscle fibers, decreasing remodeling, hypertrophy, and cell
death. Three β-blockers have shown benefit in HFrEF: bisoprolol  [bis-oh-PROE-lol], carvedilol  [KAR-ve-dil-ol],
and long-acting metoprolol succinate [me-TOE-proe-lol SUK-si-nate]. Carvedilol  is a nonselective β-adrenoreceptor
antagonist that also blocks α-adrenoreceptors, whereas bisoprolol  and metoprolol succinate are β1-selective
antagonists. [Note: The pharmacology of β-blockers is described in detail in Chapter 7.] β-Blockade is
recommended for all patients with chronic, stable HFrEF. Bisoprolol , carvedilol , and metoprolol succinate reduce
morbidity and mortality associated with HFrEF. Treatment should be started at low doses and gradually titrated to
target doses based on patient tolerance and vital signs. Both carvedilol  and metoprolol  are metabolized by the
cytochrome P450 2D6 isoenzyme, and inhibitors of this metabolic pathway may increase levels of these drugs and
increase the risk of adverse effects. In addition, carvedilol  is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Increased effects
of carvedilol  may occur if it is coadministered with P-gp inhibitors. β-Blockers should also be used with caution
with other drugs that slow AV conduction, such as amiodarone, verapamil , and diltiazem.

--- PAGE 699 ---

V.  Diuretics
Diuretics reduce signs and symptoms of volume overload, such as dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and peripheral
edema. Diuretics decrease plasma volume and, subsequently, decrease venous return to the heart (preload). This
decreases cardiac workload and oxygen demand. Diuretics may also decrease afterload by reducing plasma volume,
thereby decreasing blood pressure. Loop diuretics are the most commonly used diuretics in HF. These agents are
used for patients who require extensive diuresis and those with renal insufficiency. Since diuretics have not been
shown to improve survival in HF, they should only be used to treat signs and symptoms of volume excess. Please
see Chapter 17 for a full discussion of diuretics.

VI.  Angiotensin Receptor–Neprilysin Inhibitor
Neprilysin is the enzyme responsible for breaking down vasoactive peptides, such as angiotensin I and II,
bradykinin, and natriuretic peptides. Inhibition of neprilysin augments the activity of the vasoactive peptides. To
maximize the effect of natriuretic peptides, stimulation of the RAAS must be offset without further increase in
bradykinin. Therefore an ARB, instead of an ACE inhibitor, is combined with a neprilysin inhibitor to reduce the
incidence of angioedema (Figure 18.6).
Figure 18.6 Effects of angiotensin receptor blocker–neprilysin inhibitors. ARB =
angiotensin receptor blocker; ARNI = angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor; AT1 =
angiotensin type 1; NI, neprilysin inhibitor; NP = natriuretic peptide; RAAS = renin–
angiotensin–aldosterone system; SNS = sympathetic nervous system.
700
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 701 ---

A.  Sacubitril/valsartan
Sacubitril  [sak-UE-bi-tril]/ valsartan is the first available angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI).
1.  Actions
Sacubitril /valsartan combines the actions of an ARB with neprilysin inhibition. Inhibition of neprilysin results in
increased concentration of vasoactive peptides, leading to natriuresis, diuresis, vasodilation, and inhibition of
fibrosis. Together, the combination decreases afterload, preload, and myocardial fibrosis. An ARNI improves
survival and clinical signs and symptoms of HF, as compared to therapy with an ACE inhibitor.
2.  Therapeutic use
An ARNI should replace an ACE inhibitor or ARB in patients with HFrEF who remain symptomatic on optimal
doses of a β-blocker and an ACE inhibitor or ARB.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
Sacubitril /valsartan is orally active, administered with or without food, and quickly breaks down into the separate
components. Sacubitril  is transformed to active drug by plasma esterases. Both drugs have a high volume of
distribution and are highly bound to plasma proteins. Sacubitril  is mainly excreted in the urine. The half-life of
approximately 10 hours for both components allows for twice-daily dosing.
4.  Adverse effects
The adverse effect profile is similar to that of an ACE inhibitor or ARB. Because of the added reduction of afterload,
hypotension is more common with an ARNI. Due to inhibition of neprilysin with sacubitril , bradykinin levels may
increase and angioedema may occur. Therefore, the combination is contraindicated in patients with a history of
hereditary angioedema or angioedema associated with an ACE inhibitor or ARB. To minimize risk of angioedema,
an ACE inhibitor must be stopped at least 36 hours prior to starting sacubitril/valsartan.

VII.  Hyperpolarization-Activated Cyclic Nucleotide–Gated
Channel Blocker
The hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide–gated (HCN) channel is responsible for the If current and setting
the pace within the SA node. Inhibition of the HCN channel results in slowing of depolarization and a lower heart
rate (Figure 18.7). Reduction in heart rate is use and dose dependent.
Figure 18.7 Effects of inhibition of If current with ivabradine. HR = heart rate; K+ =
potassium; Na+ = sodium; SA = sinoatrial.
702
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 703 ---

A.  Ivabradine
Ivabradine [eye-VAB-ra-deen] is the only approved drug in the class of HCN channel blockers.
1.  Actions
By selectively slowing the If current in the SA node, reduction of heart rate occurs without a reduction in
contractility, AV conduction, ventricular repolarization, or blood pressure. In patients with HFrEF, a slower heart
rate increases stroke volume and improves symptoms of HF.
2.  Therapeutic use
Ivabradine is utilized in HFrEF to improve symptoms in patients who are in sinus rhythm with a heart rate above 70
beats per minute and are on optimized HF pharmacotherapy. Specifically, patients should be on an optimal dose of
β-blocker or have a contraindication to β-blockers.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
Ivabradine should be administered with meals to increase absorption. It undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism
by cytochrome P450 3A4 to an active metabolite, which is also a 3A4 substrate. Ivabradine has a high volume of
distribution and is 70% protein bound. The half-life is 6 hours, which allows for twice-daily dosing.
4.  Adverse effects
Bradycardia may occur with ivabradine, which may improve with dose reduction. Because ivabradine is mostly
selective for the SA node, it is not effective for rate control in atrial fibrillation and has been shown to increase the
risk of atrial fibrillation. Ivabradine inhibits similar channels in the eye, and luminous phenomena may occur early
in therapy. This enhanced brightness may be ameliorated by dose reduction. Ivabradine should not be used in
pregnancy or breast-feeding, with more advanced heart block, or with potent 3A4 inhibitors.

--- PAGE 704 ---

VIII.  Vaso- and Venodilators
Dilation of venous blood vessels leads to a decrease in cardiac preload by increasing venous capacitance. Nitrates
are commonly used venous dilators to reduce preload for patients with chronic HF. Arterial dilators, such as
hydralazine [hye-DRAL-a-zeen], reduce systemic arteriolar resistance and decrease afterload. If the patient is
intolerant of ACE inhibitors or ARBs, or if additional vasodilator response is required, a combination of hydralazine
and isosorbide dinitrate [eye-soe-SOR-bide dye-NYE-trate] may be used. A fixed-dose combination of these agents
has been shown to improve symptoms and survival in black patients with HFrEF on standard HF treatment (β-
blocker plus ACE inhibitor or ARB). Headache, dizziness, and hypotension are common adverse effects with this
combination. Rarely, hydralazine has been associated with drug-induced lupus.
704
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 705 ---

IX.  Inotropic Drugs
Positive inotropic agents enhance cardiac contractility and, thus, increase cardiac output. Although these drugs act
by different mechanisms, the inotropic action is the result of an increased cytoplasmic calcium concentration that
enhances the contractility of cardiac muscle. All positive inotropes in HFrEF that increase intracellular calcium
concentration have been associated with reduced survival, especially in patients with HFrEF. For this reason, these
agents, with the exception of digoxin, are only used for a short period mainly in the inpatient setting.
705
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 706 ---

A.  Digitalis glycosides
The cardiac glycosides are often called digitalis or digitalis glycosides, because most of the drugs come from the
digitalis (foxglove) plant. They are a group of chemically similar compounds that can increase the contractility of
the heart muscle and, therefore, are used in treating HF. The digitalis glycosides have a low therapeutic index, with
only a small difference between a therapeutic dose and doses that are toxic or even fatal. The only available agent is
digoxin [di-JOX-in].
1.  Mechanism of action
a.  Regulation of cytosolic calcium concentration
By inhibiting the Na+/K+-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) enzyme, digoxin reduces the ability of the myocyte to
actively pump Na+ from the cell (Figure 18.8). This ultimately results in a small but physiologically important
increase in free Ca2+, thereby leading to increased cardiac contractility.
Figure 18.8 Mechanism of action of digoxin. ATPase = adenosine triphosphatase.
b.  Increased contractility of the cardiac muscle
Digoxin increases the force of cardiac contraction, causing cardiac output to more closely resemble that of the
normal heart (Figure 18.9). Vagal tone is also enhanced, so both heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand decrease.
Digoxin slows conduction velocity through the AV node, making it useful for atrial fibrillation.
706
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 707 ---

Figure 18.9 Ventricular function curves in the normal heart, in heart failure (HF), and in
HF treated with digoxin.
c.  Neurohormonal inhibition
Although the exact mechanism of this effect has not been elucidated, low-dose digoxin inhibits sympathetic
activation with minimal effects on contractility. This effect is the reason a lower serum drug concentration is
targeted in HFrEF.
2.  Therapeutic use
Digoxin therapy is indicated in patients with HFrEF who are symptomatic on optimal HF pharmacotherapy. A low
serum drug concentration of digoxin (0.5 to 0.8 ng/mL) is beneficial in HFrEF.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
Digoxin is available in oral and injectable formulations. It has a large volume of distribution, because it accumulates
in muscle. The dosage is based on lean body weight. In acute situations, such as symptomatic atrial fibrillation, a
loading dose regimen is used. Digoxin has a long half-life of 30 to 40 hours. It is mainly eliminated intact by the
kidney, requiring dose adjustment in renal dysfunction.
4.  Adverse effects
At low serum drug concentrations, digoxin is well tolerated. However, it has a very narrow therapeutic index.
Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, or yellowish vision may be initial indicators of toxicity. When Na+/K+-
ATPase is markedly inhibited by digoxin, the resting membrane potential may increase, which makes the membrane
more excitable, increasing the risk of arrhythmias. Decreased levels of serum potassium (hypokalemia) predispose a
patient to digoxin toxicity, because digoxin normally competes with potassium for the same binding site on the
Na+/K+-ATPase pump. With the use of a lower serum drug concentration in HFrEF, toxic levels are infrequent.
Digoxin is a substrate of P-gp, and inhibitors of P-gp, such as clarithromycin, verapamil , and amiodarone, can
significantly increase digoxin levels, necessitating a reduced dose of digoxin. Digoxin should also be used with
caution with other drugs that slow AV conduction, such as β-blockers, verapamil , and diltiazem.

B.  β-Adrenergic agonists
β-Adrenergic agonists, such as dobutamine [doe-BUE-ta-meen] and dopamine [DOE-pa-meen], improve cardiac
performance by causing positive inotropic effects and vasodilation. β-Adrenergic agonists ultimately lead to
increased entry of calcium ions into myocardial cells and enhanced contraction (Figure 18.10). Both drugs must be
given by intravenous infusion and are primarily used in the short-term treatment of acute HF in the hospital setting.

monophosphate; ATP = adenosine triphosphate; cAMP = cyclic adenosine
monophosphate; P = phosphate.

C.  Phosphodiesterase inhibitors
Milrinone [MIL-ri-none] is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that increases the intracellular concentration of cAMP
(Figure 18.10). Like β-adrenergic agonists, this results in an increase of intracellular calcium and, therefore, cardiac
contractility. Milrinone is usually given by intravenous infusion for short-term treatment of acute HF. However,
dobutamine and milrinone may also be considered for intermediate-term treatment in the outpatient setting for
palliative care.

X.  Recombinant B-type Natriuretic Peptide
In acute decompensated congestive HF, drugs that reduce preload result in improvement in HF symptoms such as
dyspnea. Most often, IV diuretics are utilized in the acute setting to reduce preload. When IV diuretics are minimally
effective, a recombinant B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), or nesiritide [ness-EAR-a-tide], can be used as an
alternative. Through binding to natriuretic peptide receptors, nesiritide stimulates natriuresis and diuresis and
reduces preload and afterload. Nesiritide is administered intravenously as a bolus (most often) and continuous
infusion. Like endogenous BNP, nesiritide has a short half-life of 20 minutes and is cleared by renal filtration,
cleavage by endopeptidases and through internalization after binding to natriuretic peptide receptors. The most
common adverse effects are hypotension and dizziness, and like diuretics, nesiritide can worsen renal function.

XI.  Order of Therapy
Guidelines have classified HF into four stages, from least to most severe. Figure 18.11 shows a treatment strategy
using this classification and the drugs described in this chapter. Note that as the disease progresses, polytherapy is
initiated. In patients with overt HF, loop diuretics are often introduced first for relief of signs or symptoms of
volume overload, such as dyspnea and peripheral edema. ACE inhibitors or ARBs (if ACE inhibitors are not
tolerated) are added after the optimization of diuretic therapy. The dosage is gradually titrated to that which is
maximally tolerated and/or produces optimal cardiac output. Historically, β-blockers were added after optimization
of ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy; however, most patients newly diagnosed with HFrEF are initiated on both low
doses of an ACE inhibitor and β-blocker after initial stabilization. These agents are slowly titrated to optimal levels
to increase tolerability. Aldosterone antagonists and fixed-dose hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate are initiated in
patients who continue to have HF symptoms despite optimal doses of an ACE inhibitor and β-blocker. Once at an
optimal ACE inhibitor or ARB dose and if the patient remains symptomatic, either can be replaced by
sacubitril/valsartan. Lastly, digoxin and ivabradine are added for symptomatic benefit only in patients on optimal
HF pharmacotherapy.

enzyme; ARBs = angiotensin receptor blockers; FDC = fixed-dose combination; HYD =

interventions) is not shown.

18.6Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
A patient is newly diagnosed with HFrEF and is asymptomatic. Which is the most appropriate drug to
initiate for symptomatic and survival benefits?
A.  Dobutamine
B.  Furosemide
C.  Lisinopril
D.  Sacubitril/valsartan
Correct answer = C. ACE inhibitors should be initiated in all patients, unless contraindicated, if they have HFrEF
and are asymptomatic. This is known as stage B HF. Dobutamine and furosemide improve symptoms only.
Sacubitril/valsartan will replace an ACE inhibitor if the patient remains symptomatic on optimal HF
pharmacotherapy.
Which of the following statements best describes the action of ACE inhibitors on the failing heart?
A.  Increased vascular resistance.
B.  Decreased cardiac output.
C.  Reduced preload.
D.  Increased aldosterone.
Correct answer = C. ACE inhibitors decrease vascular resistance, decrease preload, decrease afterload, and
increase cardiac output. In addition, ACE inhibitors blunt aldosterone release.
A Hispanic man with HFrEF currently takes maximally tolerated doses of metoprolol succinate and
enalapril, along with moderate-dose furosemide. He is euvolemic, but continues to have HF symptoms. The
systolic blood pressure is low, but the patient does not have signs or symptoms of hypotension. Which is the
best recommendation to improve HF symptoms and survival in this patient?
A.  Stop enalapril, wait 36 hours, and start sacubitril/valsartan.
B.  Start digoxin.
C.  Start fixed-dose hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate.
D.  Start spironolactone.
Correct answer = D. Because the patient is on optimal pharmacotherapy and continues to have symptoms, another
agent is warranted. Adding low-dose spironolactone is unlikely to decrease the blood pressure and will confer a
survival and symptomatic benefit. Changing to sacubitril/valsartan will likely worsen the low blood pressure.
Digoxin will only improve symptoms and not improve survival. Fixed-dose hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate
would be appropriate if the patient were African American.
β-Blockers improve cardiac function in HF by
A.  decreasing cardiac remodeling
B.  increasing heart rate
C.  increasing renin release
D.  activating norepinephrine
Correct answer = A. Although it seems counterintuitive to decrease heart rate in HF, β-blockers improve cardiac
function by slowing heart rate, decreasing renin release, and preventing the direct effects of norepinephrine on
cardiac muscle to decrease remodeling.
A 70-year-old woman has HFrEF and hypertension. She takes lisinopril and metoprolol tartrate. She feels
well and has no cough, shortness of breath, or edema. Which of the following changes is most appropriate
for her drug therapy?
A.  Initiate digoxin.
B.  Change lisinopril to losartan.
C.  Initiate ivabradine.
D.  Change metoprolol tartrate to metoprolol succinate.
Correct answer = D. Metoprolol succinate should be used in HF, given that there is mortality benefit shown with
metoprolol succinate in landmark HF trials. Digoxin and ivabradine are not indicated since symptoms are
minimal and she is not yet on optimized guideline-directed medical therapy; there is no reason to change to an
ARB since the patient has no cough or history of angioedema.
A 75-year-old white man has HFrEF and reports stable HF symptoms. His current drug therapy includes
optimal-dose enalapril, carvedilol, and spironolactone. Which is the best recommendation to improve HF
symptoms and survival?
A.  Start fixed-dose hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate.
B.  Start ivabradine.712

18.9
18.10C.  Replace enalapril with sacubitril/valsartan.
D.  Start digoxin.
Correct answer = C. Since patient is on optimal doses of HF medications and he continues to have symptoms,
replacing enalapril with sacubitril/valsartan is the only option that improves both symptoms and survival in a
white patient.
How is spironolactone beneficial in HF?
A.  Promotes potassium secretion
B.  Acts as aldosterone agonist
C.  Prevents cardiac hypertrophy
D.  Decreases blood glucose
Correct answer = C. Spironolactone antagonizes aldosterone, which in turn prevents salt/water retention, cardiac
hypertrophy, and hypokalemia. Spironolactone has endocrine effects on hormones, but not on glucose.
Which of the following is important to monitor in patients taking digoxin?
A.  Chloride
B.  Potassium
C.  Sodium
D.  Zinc
Correct answer = B. Hypokalemia can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias and increases the potential of cardiac
toxicity with digoxin.
Which of the following describes the mechanism of action of milrinone in HF?
A.  Decreases intracellular calcium
B.  Increases cardiac contractility
C.  Decreases cAMP
D.  Activates phosphodiesterase
Correct answer = B. Milrinone is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that leads to increased cAMP, increased
intracellular calcium, and therefore increased contractility.
BH is a 52-year-old African American woman who has HFrEF. She is seen in clinic today reporting stable
HF symptoms, but is having occasional peripheral brightness. Otherwise, vision is unchanged. Current
medication regimen includes sacubitril/valsartan, carvedilol, fixed-dose hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate,
ivabradine, and bumetanide. Which is the best recommendation to minimize the adverse effect of peripheral
brightness?
A.  Stop all HF medications immediately.
B.  Discontinue sacubitril/valsartan only.
C.  Do nothing; this adverse effect will slowly improve over time.
D.  Reduce the dose of ivabradine.
Correct answer = D. Luminous phenomena can occur with ivabradine. This adverse effect can be minimized with
dose reduction or discontinuation.

--- PAGE 715 ---

I.  Overview
In contrast to skeletal muscle, which contracts only when it receives a stimulus, the heart contains specialized cells
that exhibit automaticity. That is, they intrinsically generate rhythmic action potentials in the absence of external
stimuli. These “pacemaker” cells differ from other myocardial cells in showing a slow, spontaneous depolarization
during diastole (phase 4), caused by an inward positive current carried by sodium and calcium ions. This
depolarization is fastest in the sinoatrial (SA) node (the initiation site of the action potential), and it decreases
throughout the normal conduction pathway through the atrioventricular (AV) node to the bundle of His and the
Purkinje system. Dysfunction of impulse generation or conduction at any of a number of sites in the heart can cause
an abnormality in cardiac rhythm. Figure 19.1 summarizes the drugs used to treat cardiac arrhythmias.

II.  Introduction to the Arrhythmias
Arrhythmias are caused by abnormalities in impulse formation and conduction in the myocardium. Arrhythmias
present as a complex family of disorders with a variety of symptoms. To make sense of this large group of disorders,
it is useful to organize arrhythmias into groups according to anatomic site of the abnormality: the atria, the AV node,
or the ventricles. Figure 19.2 summarizes several common arrhythmias.
Figure 19.2 Therapeutic indications for some commonly encountered arrhythmias. AV =
atrioventricular.
717
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 718 ---

A.  Causes of arrhythmias
Most arrhythmias arise either from aberrations in impulse generation (abnormal automaticity) or from a defect in
impulse conduction.
1.  Abnormal automaticity
The SA node shows a faster rate of discharge than do other pacemaker cells, and thus, it normally sets the pace of
contraction for the myocardium. If cardiac sites other than the SA node show enhanced automaticity, they may
generate competing stimuli, and arrhythmias may arise. Most of the antiarrhythmic agents suppress automaticity by
blocking either sodium (Na+) or calcium (Ca2+) channels to reduce the ratio of these ions to potassium (K+). This
decreases the slope of phase 4 (diastolic) depolarization and/or raises the threshold of discharge to a less negative
voltage, leading to an overall decrease in frequency of discharge. This effect is more pronounced in cells with
ectopic pacemaker activity than in normal cells.
2.  Abnormalities in impulse conduction
Impulses from higher pacemaker centers are normally conducted down pathways that bifurcate to activate the entire
ventricular surface (Figure 19.3). A phenomenon called reentry can occur if a unidirectional block caused by
myocardial injury or a prolonged refractory period results in an abnormal conduction pathway. Reentry is the most
common cause of arrhythmias, and it can occur at any level of the cardiac conduction system. This short-circuit
pathway results in reexcitation of cardiac muscle, causing premature contraction or a sustained arrhythmia.
Antiarrhythmic agents prevent reentry by slowing conduction (class I drugs) and/or increasing the refractory period
(class III drugs), thereby converting a unidirectional block into a bidirectional block.

--- PAGE 720 ---

B.  Antiarrhythmic drugs
Antiarrhythmic drugs can modify impulse generation and conduction to prevent arrhythmias or to reduce symptoms
associated with arrhythmias. Unfortunately, many of the antiarrhythmic agents are known to have dangerous
proarrhythmic actions—that is, to cause arrhythmias. Inhibition of K+ channels widens the action potential and can,
thus, prolong the QT interval. If prolongation is excessive, these drugs increase the risk of developing life-
threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias (torsades de pointes). The most common cause of QT prolongation is drug-
induced, although other conditions (for example, ischemia and hypokalemia) and genetic abnormalities may
contribute. In addition to antiarrhythmics, many other drugs are known to prolong the QT interval, such as
macrolide antibiotics and antipsychotics. Caution should be employed when combining drugs with additive effects
on the QT interval or when giving QT-prolonging antiarrhythmic agents with drugs known to inhibit their
metabolism.
Antiarrhythmic drugs can be classified (Vaughan-Williams classification) according to their predominant effects
on the action potential (Figure 19.4). Although this classification is convenient, it has some limitations. Many
antiarrhythmic drugs have actions relating to more than one class or may have active metabolites with a different
class of action, or may have an action that does not meet any formal classification.
Figure 19.4 Actions of antiarrhythmic drugs. SA = sinoatrial; AV = atrioventricular.
720
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 721 ---

III.  Class I Antiarrhythmic Drugs
Class I antiarrhythmic drugs act by blocking voltage-sensitive Na+ channels. They bind more rapidly to open or
inactivated Na+ channels than to channels that are fully repolarized. Therefore, these drugs show a greater degree of
blockade in tissues that are frequently depolarizing. This property is called use dependence (or state dependence),
and it enables these drugs to block cells that are discharging at an abnormally high frequency, without interfering
with the normal beating of the heart.
The use of Na+ channel blockers has declined due to their proarrhythmic effects, particularly in patients with
reduced left ventricular function and atherosclerotic heart disease. Class I drugs are further subdivided into three
groups according to their effect on the duration of the cardiac action potential (Figure 19.4).

--- PAGE 722 ---

A.  Class IA antiarrhythmic drugs: Quinidine, procainamide, and
disopyramide
Quinidine [KWIH-nih-deen] is the prototype class IA drug. Other agents in this class include procainamide [proe-
KANE-a-mide] and disopyramide [dye-soe-PEER-a-mide]. Because of their concomitant class III activity, they can
precipitate arrhythmias that can progress to ventricular fibrillation.
1.  Mechanism of action
Quinidine binds to open and inactivated Na+ channels and prevents Na+ influx, thus slowing the rapid upstroke
during phase 0 (Figure 19.5). It decreases the slope of phase 4 spontaneous depolarization, inhibits K+ channels, and
blocks Ca2+ channels. Because of these actions, it slows conduction velocity and increases refractoriness. Quinidine
also has mild α-adrenergic blocking and anticholinergic actions. Although procainamide and disopyramide have
actions similar to those of quinidine, there is less anticholinergic activity with procainamide and more with
disopyramide. Neither procainamide nor disopyramide has α-blocking activity. Disopyramide produces a greater
negative inotropic effect, and unlike the other drugs, it causes peripheral vasoconstriction.

Figure 19.5 Schematic diagram of the effects of class IA agents. INa and IK are
transmembrane currents due to the movement of Na+ and K+, respectively.
2.  Therapeutic uses
Quinidine is used in the treatment of a wide variety of arrhythmias, including atrial, AV junctional, and ventricular
tachyarrhythmias. Procainamide is only available in an intravenous formulation and may be used to treat acute atrial
and ventricular arrhythmias. However, electrical cardioversion or defibrillation and amiodarone have mostly
replaced procainamide in clinical practice. Disopyramide can be used as an alternative treatment of ventricular
arrhythmias and may also be used for rhythm control in atrial fibrillation or flutter.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
Quinidine sulfate or gluconate is rapidly and well absorbed after oral administration. It undergoes extensive
metabolism primarily by the hepatic cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) isoenzyme, forming active metabolites. A
portion of procainamide is acetylated in the liver to N-acetylprocainamide (NAPA), which has the properties and
adverse effects of a class III drug. NAPA is eliminated via the kidney; therefore, dosages of procainamide should be
adjusted in patients with renal dysfunction. Disopyramide is well absorbed after oral administration and is
metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4 to a less active metabolite and several inactive metabolites. About half of the
drug is excreted unchanged by the kidneys.
4.  Adverse effects
Due to enhanced proarrhythmic effects and ability to worsen heart failure symptoms, class IA drugs should not be
used in patients with atherosclerotic heart disease or systolic heart failure. Large doses of quinidine may induce the
symptoms of cinchonism (for example, blurred vision, tinnitus, headache, disorientation, and psychosis). Drug
interactions are common with quinidine since it is an inhibitor of both CYP2D6 and P-glycoprotein. Intravenous
administration of procainamide may cause hypotension. Disopyramide has the most anticholinergic adverse effects
of the class IA drugs (for example, dry mouth, urinary retention, blurred vision, and constipation). Both quinidine
and disopyramide should be used with caution with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4.

B.  Class IB antiarrhythmic drugs: Lidocaine and mexiletine
The class IB agents rapidly associate and dissociate from Na+ channels. Thus, the actions are greater when the
cardiac cell is depolarized or firing rapidly. The class IB drugs lidocaine [LYE-doe-kane] and mexiletine [mex-IL-e-
teen] are useful in treating ventricular arrhythmias.
1.  Mechanism of action
In addition to Na+ channel blockade, lidocaine and mexiletine shorten phase 3 repolarization and decrease the
duration of the action potential (Figure 19.6). Neither drug contributes to negative inotropy.

Figure 19.6 Schematic diagram of the effects of class IB agents. INa and IK are
transmembrane currents due to the movement of Na+ and K+, respectively.
2.  Therapeutic uses
Although amiodarone is the drug of choice for ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia (VT), lidocaine may
be used as an alternative. Lidocaine may also be used in combination with amiodarone for VT storm. The drug does
not markedly slow conduction and, thus, has little effect on atrial or AV junction arrhythmias. Mexiletine is used for
chronic treatment of ventricular arrhythmias, often in combination with amiodarone.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
Lidocaine is given intravenously because of extensive first-pass transformation by the liver. The drug is dealkylated
to two active metabolites, primarily by CYP1A2 with a minor role by CYP3A4. Lidocaine should be monitored
closely when given in combination with drugs affecting these CYP isoenzymes. Mexiletine is well absorbed after
oral administration. It is metabolized in the liver primarily by CYP2D6 to inactive metabolites and excreted mainly
via the biliary route.
4.  Adverse effects
Lidocaine has a fairly wide therapeutic index. Central nervous system (CNS) effects include nystagmus (early
indicator of toxicity), drowsiness, slurred speech, paresthesia, agitation, confusion, and convulsions, which often
limit the duration of continuous infusions. Mexiletine has a narrow therapeutic index and caution should be used
when administering the drug with inhibitors of CYP2D6. Nausea, vomiting, and dyspepsia are the most common
adverse effects.
727
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 728 ---

C.  Class IC antiarrhythmic drugs: Flecainide and propafenone
These drugs slowly dissociate from resting Na+ channels and show prominent effects even at normal heart rates. Due
to their negative inotropic and proarrhythmic effects, use of these agents is avoided in patients with structural heart
disease (left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, atherosclerotic heart disease).
1.  Mechanism of action
Flecainide [FLEK-a-nide] suppresses phase 0 upstroke in Purkinje and myocardial fibers ( Figure 19.7). This causes
marked slowing of conduction in all cardiac tissue, with a minor effect on the duration of the action potential and
refractoriness. Automaticity is reduced by an increase in the threshold potential, rather than a decrease in slope of
phase 4 depolarization. Flecainide also blocks K+ channels, leading to increased duration of the action potential.
Propafenone [proe-PAF-e-none], like flecainide, slows conduction in all cardiac tissues but does not block K+
channels. It possesses weak β-blocking properties.

Figure 19.7 Schematic diagram of the effects of class IC agents. INa and IK are
transmembrane currents due to the movement of Na+ and K+, respectively.
2.  Therapeutic uses
Flecainide is useful in the maintenance of sinus rhythm in atrial flutter or fibrillation in patients without structural
heart disease and in treating refractory ventricular arrhythmias. Use of propafenone is restricted mostly to atrial
arrhythmias: rhythm control of atrial fibrillation or flutter and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia prophylaxis
in patients with AV reentrant tachycardias.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
Flecainide is well absorbed after oral administration and is metabolized by CYP2D6 to multiple metabolites. The
parent drug and metabolites are mostly eliminated renally. Propafenone is metabolized to active metabolites
primarily via CYP2D6, and also by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. The metabolites are excreted in the urine and the feces.
4.  Adverse effects
Flecainide is generally well tolerated, with blurred vision, dizziness, and nausea occurring most frequently.
Propafenone has a similar side effect profile, but may cause bronchospasm and should be avoided in patients with
asthma. Propafenone is also an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. Both drugs should be used with caution with potent
inhibitors of CYP2D6.

--- PAGE 731 ---

IV.  Class II Antiarrhythmic Drugs
Class II agents are β-adrenergic antagonists, or β-blockers. These drugs diminish phase 4 depolarization and, thus,
depress automaticity, prolong AV conduction, and decrease heart rate and contractility. Class II agents are useful in
treating tachyarrhythmias caused by increased sympathetic activity. They are also used for atrial flutter and
fibrillation and for AV nodal reentrant tachycardia. In addition, β-blockers prevent life-threatening ventricular
arrhythmias following a myocardial infarction.
Metoprolol  [me-TOE-pro-lol] is the most widely used β-blocker for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.
Compared to nonselective β-blockers, such as propranolol  [pro-PRAN-oh-lol], it reduces the risk of bronchospasm.
It is extensively metabolized by CYP2D6 and has CNS penetration (less than propranolol , but more than atenolol
[a-TEN-oh-lol]). Esmolol  [ES-moe-lol] is a very short and fast-acting β-blocker used for intravenous administration
in acute arrhythmias that occur during surgery or emergency situations. Esmolol  is rapidly metabolized by esterases
in red blood cells. As such, there are no pharmacokinetic drug interactions. Common adverse effects with β-blockers
include bradycardia, hypotension, and fatigue (see Chapter 7).

--- PAGE 732 ---

V.  Class III Antiarrhythmic Drugs
Class III agents block K+ channels and, thus, diminish the outward K+ current during repolarization of cardiac cells.
These agents prolong the duration of the action potential without altering phase 0 of depolarization or the resting
membrane potential (Figure 19.8). Instead, they prolong the effective refractory period, increasing refractoriness. All
class III drugs have the potential to induce arrhythmias.

A.  Amiodarone
1.  Mechanism of action
Amiodarone [a-MEE-oh-da-rone] contains iodine and is related structurally to thyroxine. It has complex effects,
showing class I, II, III, and IV actions, as well as α-blocking activity. Its dominant effect is prolongation of the
action potential duration and the refractory period by blocking K+ channels.
2.  Therapeutic uses
Amiodarone is effective in the treatment of severe refractory supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmias.
Amiodarone has been a mainstay of therapy for the rhythm management of atrial fibrillation or flutter. Despite its
adverse effect profile, amiodarone is thought to be the least proarrhythmic of the class I and III antiarrhythmic
drugs.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
Amiodarone is incompletely absorbed after oral administration. The drug is unusual in having a prolonged half-life
of several weeks, and it distributes extensively in tissues. Full clinical effects may not be achieved until months after
initiation of treatment, unless loading doses are employed.
4.  Adverse effects
Amiodarone shows a variety of toxic effects, including pulmonary fibrosis, neuropathy, hepatotoxicity, corneal
deposits, optic neuritis, blue-gray skin discoloration, and hypo- or hyperthyroidism. However, use of low doses and
close monitoring reduce toxicity, while retaining clinical efficacy. Amiodarone is subject to numerous drug
interactions, since it is metabolized by CYP3A4 and serves as an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and P-
glycoprotein.

www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 736 ---

B.  Dronedarone
Dronedarone [droe-NE-da-rone] is a benzofuran amiodarone derivative, which is less lipophilic and has a shorter
half-life than amiodarone. It does not have the iodine moieties that are responsible for thyroid dysfunction
associated with amiodarone. Like amiodarone, it has class I, II, III, and IV actions. Dronedarone has a better
adverse effect profile than does amiodarone but may still cause liver failure. The drug is contraindicated in those
with symptomatic heart failure or permanent atrial fibrillation due to an increased risk of death. Currently,
dronedarone is used to maintain sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation or flutter, but it is less effective than amiodarone.
736
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 737 ---

C.  Sotalol
Sotalol  [SOE-ta-lol], although a class III antiarrhythmic agent, also has nonselective β-blocker activity. The
levorotatory isomer (L-sotalol ) has β-blocking activity and D-sotalol  has class III antiarrhythmic action. Sotalol
blocks a rapid outward K+ current, known as the delayed rectifier current. This blockade prolongs both
repolarization and duration of the action potential, thus lengthening the effective refractory period. Sotalol  is used
for maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or refractory paroxysmal
supraventricular tachycardia and in the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. Since sotalol  has β-blocking properties,
it is commonly used for these indications in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy or atherosclerotic heart
disease. This drug can cause the typical adverse effects associated with β-blockers but has a low rate of adverse
effects when compared to other antiarrhythmic agents. The dosing interval should be extended in patients with renal
disease, since the drug is renally eliminated. To reduce the risk of proarrhythmic effects, sotalol  should be initiated
in the hospital to monitor QT interval.

D.  Dofetilide
Dofetilide [doe-FET-i-lide] is a pure K+ channel blocker. It can be used as a first-line antiarrhythmic agent in
patients with persistent atrial fibrillation and heart failure or in those with coronary artery disease. Because of the
risk of proarrhythmia, dofetilide initiation is limited to the inpatient setting. The half-life of this oral drug is 10
hours. The drug is mainly excreted unchanged in the urine. Drugs that inhibit active tubular secretion are
contraindicated with dofetilide.

E.  Ibutilide
Ibutilide [eye-BUE-til-ide] is a K+ channel blocker that also activates the inward Na+ current (mixed class III and IA
actions). Ibutilide is the drug of choice for chemical conversion of atrial flutter, but electrical cardioversion has
supplanted its use. It undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism and is not used orally. Initiation is also limited to the
inpatient setting due to the risk of arrhythmia.

VI.  Class IV Antiarrhythmic Drugs
Class IV drugs are the nondihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blockers verapamil  [ver-AP-a-mil] and diltiazem [dil-TYE-
a-zem]. Although voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels occur in many different tissues, the major effect of Ca2+ channel
blockers is on vascular smooth muscle and the heart. Both drugs show greater action on the heart than on vascular
smooth muscle, but more so with verapamil . In the heart, verapamil  and diltiazem bind only to open depolarized
voltage-sensitive channels, thus decreasing the inward current carried by Ca2+. These drugs are use dependent in that
they prevent repolarization until the drug dissociates from the channel, resulting in a decreased rate of phase 4
spontaneous depolarization. They also slow conduction in tissues that are dependent on Ca2+ currents, such as the
AV and SA nodes (Figure 19.9). These agents are more effective against atrial than against ventricular arrhythmias.
They are useful in treating reentrant supraventricular tachycardia and in reducing the ventricular rate in atrial flutter
and fibrillation. Common adverse effects include bradycardia, hypotension, and peripheral edema. Both drugs are
metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4. Dosage adjustments may be needed in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Both
agents are subject to many drug interactions as they are CYP3A4 inhibitors, as well as substrates and inhibitors of P-
glycoprotein.

--- PAGE 744 ---

A.  Digoxin
Digoxin [di-JOX-in] inhibits the Na+/K+-ATPase pump, ultimately shortening the refractory period in atrial and
ventricular myocardial cells while prolonging the effective refractory period and diminishing conduction velocity in
the AV node. Digoxin is used to control ventricular response rate in atrial fibrillation and flutter; however,
sympathetic stimulation easily overcomes the inhibitory effects of digoxin. At toxic concentrations, digoxin causes
ectopic ventricular beats that may result in VT and fibrillation. [Note: Serum trough concentrations of 1.0 to 2.0
ng/mL are desirable for atrial fibrillation or flutter, whereas lower concentrations of 0.5 to 0.8 ng/mL are targeted for
systolic heart failure.]

--- PAGE 745 ---

B.  Adenosine
Adenosine [ah-DEN-oh-seen] is a naturally occurring nucleoside, but at high doses, the drug decreases conduction
velocity, prolongs the refractory period, and decreases automaticity in the AV node. Intravenous adenosine is the
drug of choice for converting acute supraventricular tachycardias. It has low toxicity but causes flushing, chest pain,
and hypotension. Adenosine has an extremely short duration of action (approximately 10 to 15 seconds) due to rapid
uptake by erythrocytes and endothelial cells.
745

--- PAGE 746 ---

C.  Magnesium sulfate
Magnesium is necessary for the transport of Na+, Ca2+, and K+ across cell membranes. It slows the rate of SA node
impulse formation and prolongs conduction time along the myocardial tissue. Intravenous magnesium sulfate is the
salt used to treat arrhythmias, as oral magnesium is not effective in the setting of arrhythmia. Most notably,
magnesium is the drug of choice for treating the potentially fatal arrhythmia torsades de pointes and digoxin-induced
arrhythmias.

--- PAGE 747 ---

D.  Ranolazine
Ranolazine [ra-NOE-la-zeen] is an antianginal drug with antiarrhythmic properties similar to amiodarone. However,
its main effect is to shorten repolarization and decrease the action potential duration similar to mexiletine. It is used
to treat refractory atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, often in combination with other antiarrhythmic drugs. It is well
tolerated with dizziness and constipation as the most common adverse effects. Ranolazine is extensively
metabolized in the liver by CYP3A and CYP2D6 isoenzymes and is mainly excreted by the kidney. Concomitant
use with strong CYP3A inducers or inhibitors is contraindicated.

Choose the ONE best answer.
A 60-year-old woman had a myocardial infarction. Which agent should be used to prevent life-threatening
arrhythmias that can occur post myocardial infarction in this patient?
A.  Digoxin
B.  Flecainide
C.  Metoprolol
D.  Procainamide
Correct answer = C. β-Blockers such as metoprolol prevent arrhythmias that occur subsequent to a myocardial
infarction. None of the other drugs has been shown to be effective in preventing postinfarct arrhythmias.
Flecainide should be avoided in patients with structural heart disease.
Suppression of arrhythmias resulting from a reentry focus is most likely to occur if the drug:
A.  has vagomimetic effects on the AV node
B.  is a β-blocker
C.  converts a unidirectional block to a bidirectional block
D.  slows conduction through the atria
Correct answer = C. Current theory holds that a reentrant arrhythmia is caused by damaged heart muscle, so that
conduction is slowed through the damaged area in only one direction. A drug that prevents conduction in either
direction through the damaged area interrupts the reentrant arrhythmia. Class I antiarrhythmics, such as lidocaine,
are capable of producing bidirectional block. The other choices do not have any direct effects on the direction of
blockade of conduction through damaged cardiac muscle.
A 57-year-old man is being treated for an atrial arrhythmia. He complains of dry mouth, blurred vision, and
urinary hesitancy. Which antiarrhythmic drug is he mostly like taking?
A.  Metoprolol
B.  Disopyramide
C.  Dronedarone
D.  Sotalol
Correct answer = B. The clustered symptoms of dry mouth, blurred vision, and urinary hesitancy are
characteristic of anticholinergic adverse effects, which are caused by class IA agents (in this case, disopyramide).
The other drugs do not cause anticholinergic effects.
A 58-year-old woman is being treated for chronic suppression of a ventricular arrhythmia. After 1 week of
therapy, she complains of severe upset stomach and heartburn. Which antiarrhythmic drug is the likely cause
of these symptoms?
A.  Amiodarone
B.  Digoxin
C.  Mexiletine
D.  Propranolol
Correct answer = C. The patient is exhibiting a classic adverse effect of mexiletine. None of the other agents
listed are likely to cause dyspepsia.
A 78-year-old woman has been newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. She is not currently having
symptoms of palpitations or fatigue. Which is appropriate to initiate for rate control as an outpatient?
A.  Dronedarone
B.  Esmolol
C.  Flecainide
D.  Metoprolol
Correct answer = D. Only B and D are options to control rate. The other options are used for rhythm control in
patients with atrial fibrillation. Since esmolol is IV only, the only option to start as an outpatient is metoprolol.
Which of the following is correct regarding digoxin when used for atrial fibrillation?
A.  Digoxin works by blocking voltage-sensitive calcium channels.
B.  Digoxin is used for rhythm control in patients with atrial fibrillation.
C.  Digoxin increases conduction velocity through the AV node.
D.  Digoxin levels of 1 to 2 ng/mL are desirable in the treatment of atrial fibrillation.
Correct answer = D. Digoxin works by inhibiting the Na+/K+-ATPase pump. It decreases conduction velocity
through the AV node and is used for rate control in atrial fibrillation (not rhythm control). Digoxin levels between748

19.101 and 2 ng/mL are more likely to exhibit negative chronotropic effects desired in atrial fibrillation or flutter. A
serum drug concentration between 0.5 and 0.8 ng/mL is for symptomatic management of heart failure.
All of the following are adverse effects of amiodarone except:
A.  Cinchonism
B.  Hypothyroidism
C.  Pulmonary fibrosis
D.  Blue skin discoloration
Correct answer = A. Cinchonism is a constellation of symptoms (blurred vision, tinnitus, headache, psychosis)
that is known to occur with quinidine. All other options are adverse effects with amiodarone that require close
monitoring.
Which arrhythmia can be treated with lidocaine?
A.  Paroxysmal supraventricular ventricular tachycardia
B.  Atrial fibrillation
C.  Atrial flutter
D.  Ventricular tachycardia
Correct answer = D. Lidocaine has little effect on atrial or AV nodal tissue; thus, it used for ventricular
arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia.
A clinician would like to initiate a drug for rhythm control of atrial fibrillation. Which of the following
coexisting conditions would allow for initiation of flecainide?
A.  Hypertension
B.  Left ventricular hypertrophy
C.  Coronary artery disease
D.  Heart failure
Correct answer = A. Since flecainide can increase the risk of sudden cardiac death in those with a history of
structural heart disease, only coexisting hypertension will allow for flecainide initiation. Structural heart disease
includes left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, and atherosclerotic heart disease.
Which statement regarding dronedarone is correct?
A.  Dronedarone is more effective than is amiodarone.
B.  QT interval prolongation is not a risk with dronedarone.
C.  Dronedarone increases the risk of death in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation or symptomatic heart
failure.
D.  There is no need to monitor liver function with dronedarone.
Correct answer = C. Dronedarone is not as effective as amiodarone, QT prolongation is a risk with this drug, and
liver function should be monitored when taking dronedarone since it increases the risk of liver failure. The drug is
contraindicated in those with symptomatic heart failure or permanent atrial fibrillation due to an increased risk of
death.

I.  Overview
Atherosclerotic disease of the coronary arteries, also known as coronary artery disease (CAD) or ischemic heart
disease (IHD), is the most common cause of mortality worldwide. Atherosclerotic lesions in coronary arteries can
obstruct blood flow, leading to an imbalance in myocardial oxygen supply and demand that presents as stable angina
or an acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction [MI] or unstable angina). Spasms of vascular smooth muscle
may also impede cardiac blood flow, reducing perfusion and causing ischemia and angina pain. Typical angina
pectoris is a characteristic sudden, severe, crushing chest pain that may radiate to the neck, jaw, back, and arms. All
patients with IHD and angina should receive guideline-directed medical therapy with emphasis on lifestyle
modifications (smoking cessation, physical activity, weight management) and management of modifiable risk
factors (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia) to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Medications used
for the management of stable angina are summarized in Figure 20.1.
Figure 20.1 Summary of antianginal drugs.
751

--- PAGE 752 ---

II.  Types of Angina
Angina pectoris has three patterns: 1) stable, effort-induced, classic, or typical angina; 2) unstable angina; and 3)
Prinzmetal, variant, vasospastic, or rest angina. They are caused by varying combinations of increased myocardial
oxygen demand and decreased myocardial perfusion.
752
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 753 ---

A.  Stable angina, effort-induced angina, classic or typical angina
Classic or typical angina pectoris is the most common form of angina. It is usually characterized by a short-lasting
burning, heavy, or squeezing feeling in the chest. Some ischemic episodes may present “atypically”—with extreme
fatigue, nausea, or diaphoresis—while others may not be associated with any symptoms (silent angina). Atypical
presentations are more common in women, diabetic patients, and the elderly.
Classic angina is caused by the reduction of coronary perfusion due to a fixed obstruction of a coronary artery
produced by atherosclerosis. Increased myocardial oxygen demand, such as that produced by physical activity,
emotional stress or excitement, or any other cause of increased cardiac workload (Figure 20.2), may induce
ischemia. Typical angina pectoris is promptly relieved by rest or nitroglycerin [nye-troe-GLIS-er-in]. When the
pattern of chest pain and the amount of effort needed to trigger the chest pain does not vary over time, the angina is
named “stable angina.”

plaques.

--- PAGE 756 ---

B.  Unstable angina
Unstable angina is chest pain that occurs with increased frequency, duration, and intensity and can be precipitated by
progressively less effort. Any episode of rest angina longer than 20 minutes, any new-onset angina, any increasing
(crescendo) angina, or even sudden development of shortness of breath is suggestive of unstable angina. The
symptoms are not relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. Unstable angina is a form of acute coronary syndrome and
requires hospital admission and more aggressive therapy to prevent progression to MI and death.
756
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 757 ---

C.  Prinzmetal, variant, vasospastic, or rest angina
Prinzmetal angina is an uncommon pattern of episodic angina that occurs at rest and is due to decreased blood flow
to the heart muscle caused by spasm of the coronary arteries. Although individuals with this form of angina may
have significant coronary atherosclerosis, the angina attacks are unrelated to physical activity, heart rate, or blood
pressure. Prinzmetal angina generally responds promptly to coronary vasodilators, such as nitroglycerin and calcium
channel blockers.
757
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 758 ---

D.  Acute coronary syndrome
Acute coronary syndrome is an emergency that commonly results from rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque and
partial or complete thrombosis of a coronary artery. If the thrombus occludes most of the blood vessel, and, if the
occlusion is untreated, necrosis of the cardiac muscle may ensue. MI (necrosis) is typified by increases in the serum
levels of biomarkers such as troponins and creatine kinase. The acute coronary syndrome may present as ST-
segment elevation myocardial infarction, non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, or as unstable angina.
[Note: In unstable angina, increases in biomarkers of myocardial necrosis are not present.]
758
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 759 ---

III.  Treatment Strategies
Four types of drugs, used either alone or in combination, are commonly used to manage patients with stable angina:
β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, organic nitrates, and the sodium channel–blocking drug, ranolazine (Figure
20.1). These agents help to balance the cardiac oxygen supply and demand equation by affecting blood pressure,
venous return, heart rate, and contractility. Figure 20.3 summarizes the treatment of angina in patients with
concomitant diseases, and Figure 20.4 provides a treatment algorithm for patients with stable angina.

obstructive pulmonary disease.
Figure 20.4 Treatment algorithm for improving symptoms in patients with stable angina.
759
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 760 ---

IV.  β-Adrenergic Blockers
The β-adrenergic blockers decrease the oxygen demands of the myocardium by blocking β1 receptors, resulting in
decreased heart rate, contractility, cardiac output, and blood pressure. These agents reduce myocardial oxygen
demand during exertion and at rest. As such, they can reduce both the frequency and severity of angina attacks. β-
Blockers can be used to increase exercise duration and tolerance in patients with effort-induced angina. β-Blockers
are recommended as initial antianginal therapy in all patients unless contraindicated. [Note: The exception to this
rule is vasospastic angina, in which β-blockers are ineffective and may actually worsen symptoms.] β-Blockers
reduce the risk of death and MI in patients who have had a prior MI and also improve mortality in patients with
heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Agents with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) such as pindolol
should be avoided in patients with angina and those with a history of MI. Propranolol  is the prototype for this class
of compounds, but it is not cardioselective (see Chapter 7). Thus, other β-blockers, such as metoprolol  and atenolol ,
are preferred. [Note: All β-blockers are nonselective at high doses and can inhibit β2 receptors.] β-Blockers should
be avoided in patients with severe bradycardia; however, they can be used in patients with diabetes, peripheral
vascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as long as they are monitored closely. Nonselective β-
blockers should be avoided in patients with asthma. [Note: It is important not to discontinue β-blocker therapy
abruptly. The dose should be gradually tapered off over 2 to 3 weeks to avoid rebound angina, MI, and
hypertension.]
760
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 761 ---

V.  Calcium Channel Blockers
Calcium is essential for muscular contraction. Calcium influx is increased in ischemia because of the membrane
depolarization that hypoxia produces. In turn, this promotes the activity of several ATP-consuming enzymes,
thereby depleting energy stores and worsening the ischemia. The calcium channel blockers protect the tissue by
inhibiting the entrance of calcium into cardiac and smooth muscle cells of the coronary and systemic arterial beds.
All calcium channel blockers are, therefore, arteriolar vasodilators that cause a decrease in smooth muscle tone and
vascular resistance. These agents primarily affect the resistance of peripheral and coronary arteriolar smooth muscle.
In the treatment of effort-induced angina, calcium channel blockers reduce myocardial oxygen consumption by
decreasing vascular resistance, thereby decreasing afterload. Their efficacy in vasospastic angina is due to relaxation
of the coronary arteries. [Note: Verapamil  mainly affects the myocardium, whereas amlodipine exerts a greater
effect on smooth muscle in the peripheral vasculature. Diltiazem is intermediate in its actions.] All calcium channel
blockers lower blood pressure.
761
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 762 ---

A.  Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers
Amlodipine [am-LOE-di-peen], an oral dihydropyridine, has minimal effect on cardiac conduction and functions
mainly as an arteriolar vasodilator. The vasodilatory effect of amlodipine is useful in the treatment of variant angina
caused by spontaneous coronary spasm. Nifedipine [ni-FED-i-pine] is another agent in this class; it is usually
administered as an extended-release oral formulation. [Note: Short-acting dihydropyridines should be avoided in
CAD because of evidence of increased mortality after an MI and an increase in acute MI in hypertensive patients.]
762
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 763 ---

B.  Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers
Verapamil  [ver-AP-a-mil] slows atrioventricular (AV) conduction directly and decreases heart rate, contractility,
blood pressure, and oxygen demand. Verapamil  has greater negative inotropic effects than amlodipine, but it is a
weaker vasodilator. Verapamil  is contraindicated in patients with preexisting depressed cardiac function or AV
conduction abnormalities. Diltiazem [dil-TYE-a-zem] also slows AV conduction, decreases the rate of firing of the
sinus node pacemaker, and is also a coronary artery vasodilator. Diltiazem can relieve coronary artery spasm and is
particularly useful in patients with variant angina. Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers can worsen heart
failure due to their negative inotropic effect, and their use should be avoided in this population.

VI.  Organic Nitrates
These compounds cause a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand, followed by relief of symptoms. They are
effective in stable, unstable, and variant angina.
764
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 765 ---

A.  Mechanism of action
Organic nitrates relax vascular smooth muscle by their intracellular conversion to nitrite ions and then to nitric
oxide, which in turn activates guanylate cyclase and increases synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate
(cGMP). Elevated cGMP ultimately leads to dephosphorylation of the myosin light chain, resulting in vascular
smooth muscle relaxation (Figure 20.5). Nitrates such as nitroglycerin cause dilation of the large veins, which
reduces preload (venous return to the heart) and, therefore, reduces the work of the heart. Nitrates also dilate the
coronary vasculature, providing an increased blood supply to the heart muscle.
Figure 20.5 Effects of nitrates and nitrites on smooth muscle. cGMP = cyclic guanosine
3′,5′-monophosphate.
765
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 766 ---

B.  Pharmacokinetics
Nitrates differ in their onset of action and rate of elimination. The onset of action varies from 1 minute for
nitroglycerin to 30 minutes for isosorbide [eye-soe-SOR-bide] mononitrate (Figure 20.6). Sublingual nitroglycerin,
available in tablet or spray formulation, is the drug of choice for prompt relief of an angina attack precipitated by
exercise or emotional stress. All patients should have nitroglycerin on hand to treat acute angina attacks. Significant
first-pass metabolism of nitroglycerin occurs in the liver. Therefore, it is commonly administered via the sublingual
or transdermal route (patch or ointment), thereby avoiding the hepatic first-pass effect. Isosorbide mononitrate owes
its improved bioavailability and long duration of action to its stability against hepatic breakdown. Oral isosorbide
dinitrate undergoes denitration to two mononitrates, both of which possess antianginal activity.

preparations.

--- PAGE 769 ---

C.  Adverse effects
Headache is the most common adverse effect of nitrates. High doses of nitrates can also cause postural hypotension,
facial flushing, and tachycardia. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors such as sildenafil  potentiate the action of the
nitrates. To preclude the dangerous hypotension that may occur, this combination is contraindicated.
Tolerance to the actions of nitrates develops rapidly as the blood vessels become desensitized to vasodilation.
Tolerance can be overcome by providing a daily “nitrate-free interval” to restore sensitivity to the drug. The nitrate-
free interval of 10 to 12 hours is usually taken at night when myocardial oxygen demand is decreased. However,
variant angina worsens early in the morning, perhaps due to circadian catecholamine surges. Therefore, the nitrate-
free interval in patients with variant angina should occur in the late afternoon. Nitroglycerin patches are worn for 12
hours and then removed for 12 hours to provide the nitrate-free interval.

VII.  Sodium Channel Blocker
Ranolazine [ra-NOE-la-zeen] inhibits the late phase of the sodium current (late INa), improving the oxygen supply
and demand equation. Inhibition of late INa reduces intracellular sodium and calcium overload, thereby improving
diastolic function. Ranolazine has antianginal as well as antiarrhythmic properties. It is most often used in patients
who have failed other antianginal therapies. The antianginal effects of ranolazine are considerably less in women
than in men. The reason for this difference in effect is unknown. Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in the liver,
mainly by the CYP3A family and also by CYP2D6. It is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein. As such, ranolazine is
subject to numerous drug interactions. In addition, ranolazine can prolong the QT interval and should be avoided
with other drugs that cause QT prolongation.

Choose the ONE best answer.
20.1Which of the following best describes stable angina?
A.  Angina that occurs more frequently or with progressively less exercise or stress than before
B.  Angina due to spasm of coronary arteries
C.  Angina due to increased myocardial demand which is reproducible and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin
D.  Angina pain accompanied by increases in serum biomarkers of myocardial necrosis
Correct answer = C. When the pattern of the chest pain and the amount of effort needed to trigger the chest pain
does not vary over time, the angina is named “stable angina.”
20.2Which medication should be prescribed to all angina patients to treat an acute attack?
A.  Isosorbide dinitrate
B.  Nitroglycerin patch
C.  Nitroglycerin sublingual tablet or spray
D.  Ranolazine
Correct answer = C. The other options will not provide prompt relief of angina and should not be used to treat an
acute attack.
20.3Which of the following instructions is important to communicate to a patient receiving a prescription for
the nitroglycerin patch?
A.  Apply the patch at onset of angina symptoms for quick relief.
B.  Remove the old patch after 24 hours of use, then immediately apply the next patch to prevent any breakthrough
angina pain.
C.  Do not use sublingual nitroglycerin in combination with the patch.
D.  Have a nitrate-free interval of 10 to 12 hours every day to prevent development of nitrate tolerance.
Correct answer = D. Nitrate-free intervals help prevent the development of nitrate tolerance. Sublingual
nitroglycerin should be used to treat breakthrough angina due to its quick onset of action; transdermal
nitroglycerin has a delayed onset of action.
20.4A 64-year-old man was prescribed atenolol and sublingual nitroglycerin after his recent hospitalization
for unstable angina. Which of his current medications should be discontinued?
A.  Sildenafil
B.  Amlodipine
C.  Metformin
D.  Lisinopril
Correct answer = A. Sildenafil and other PDE-5 inhibitors can potentiate the vasodilator effects of nitrates and
cause an unsafe drop in blood pressure. Concomitant use of nitrates and PDE-5 inhibitors should be avoided.
20.5Which of the following correctly ranks the calcium channel blockers from most active on the
myocardium to most peripherally active?
A.  Diltiazem, amlodipine, verapamil
B.  Verapamil, diltiazem, nifedipine
C.  Nifedipine, verapamil, diltiazem
D.  Amlodipine, diltiazem, verapamil
Correct answer = B. Verapamil has the most negative inotropic effects, nifedipine is a peripheral vasodilator, and
diltiazem is intermediate with actions on both myocardial and peripheral calcium channels.
20.6A 76-year-old man with uncontrolled hypertension is experiencing typical angina pain that is relieved
with rest and sublingual nitroglycerin. He has a high blood pressure (178/92 mm Hg) and a low heart rate (54
bpm). Which is the most appropriate therapy for his angina at this time?
A.  Ranolazine
B.  Verapamil
C.  Metoprolol
D.  Amlodipine
Correct answer = D. Amlodipine is the best choice because it will improve angina as well as help control blood
pressure, without further reducing the heart rate. Adding verapamil or metoprolol may worsen the bradycardia.
Ranolazine may help the angina, but it will not improve the hypertension.

20.10He is adherent to a maximized dose of β-blocker with a low heart rate and low blood pressure. He is unable
to tolerate an increase in isosorbide mononitrate due to headache. Which is the most appropriate addition to
his antianginal therapy?
A.  Nifedipine
B.  Aspirin
C.  Ranolazine
D.  Verapamil
Correct answer = C. Ranolazine is the best answer. The patient’s blood pressure is low, and verapamil and
nifedipine may drop blood pressure further. Verapamil may also decrease heart rate. Ranolazine can be used
when other agents are maximized, especially when blood pressure is well controlled. The patient will need a
baseline ECG and lab work to ensure safe use of this medication.
20.8A 62-year-old man with ischemic heart disease complains of angina pain that has been getting
progressively worse over the past 30 minutes despite use of nitroglycerin. Which of the following is the best
course of action?
A.  Change nitroglycerin to a long-acting nitrate.
B.  Initiate metoprolol .
C.  Initiate ranolazine.
D.  Refer him to the nearest emergency department for immediate evaluation.
Correct answer = C. Crescendo angina is indicative of unstable angina that requires immediate evaluation.
20.9Which is correct regarding antianginal therapy in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection
fraction?
A.  β-Blockers have been associated with reduced mortality.
B.  Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should be avoided.
C.  β-Blockers with ISA are preferred over those without ISA.
D.  Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should be used in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection
fraction who cannot tolerate β-blockers.
Correct answer = A. β-Blockers have been shown to reduce mortality in heart failure with reduced ejection
fraction, but β-blockers with ISA should be avoided in these patients. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers
can be used in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, but nondihydropyridine calcium channel
blockers should be avoided due to negative inotropic effects.
20.10A 45-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes has been diagnosed with Prinzmetal angina. Which of the
following is correct regarding management of angina in this patient?
A.  β-Blockers are the treatment of choice but should be avoided because of her diabetes.
B.  Nitroglycerin is not beneficial for this type of angina.
C.  She should be counseled to take nitroglycerin before physical activity to prevent symptoms.
D.  Felodipine will be more effective than verapamil .
Correct answer = D. Prinzmetal or vasospastic angina responds well to vasodilators, including the
dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker felodipine. Verapamil is a weak vasodilator. Beta-blockers may be used
with caution in patients with diabetes, but these drugs are less effective options for Prinzmetal angina. Nitrates are
also effective, but Prinzmetal angina is provoked by coronary artery vasospasm rather than physical activity.

I.  Overview
This chapter describes drugs that are useful in the treatment of disorders of hemostasis. Thrombosis, the formation
of an unwanted clot within a blood vessel, is the most common abnormality of hemostasis. Thrombotic disorders
include acute myocardial infarction (MI), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and acute
ischemic stroke. These conditions are treated with drugs such as anticoagulants and fibrinolytics. Bleeding disorders
related to the failure of hemostasis are less common than thromboembolic disorders. Bleeding disorders include
hemophilia, which is treated with transfusion of recombinant factor VIII, and vitamin K deficiency, which is treated
with vitamin K supplementation. Figure 21.1 summarizes agents used for the treatment of dysfunctions of
hemostasis.

II.  Thrombus Versus Embolus
A clot that adheres to a vessel wall is called a “thrombus,” whereas an intravascular clot that floats in the blood is
termed an “embolus.” Thus, a detached thrombus becomes an embolus. Both thrombi and emboli are dangerous,
because they may occlude blood vessels and deprive tissues of oxygen and nutrients. Arterial thrombosis most often
occurs in medium-sized vessels rendered thrombogenic by atherosclerosis. Arterial thrombosis usually consists of a
platelet-rich clot. In contrast, venous thrombosis is triggered by blood stasis or inappropriate activation of the
coagulation cascade. Venous thrombosis typically involves a clot that is rich in fibrin, with fewer platelets than are
observed with arterial clots.
777

--- PAGE 778 ---

III.  Platelet Response to Vascular Injury
Physical trauma to the vascular system, such as a puncture or a cut, initiates a complex series of interactions between
platelets, endothelial cells, and the coagulation cascade. These interactions lead to hemostasis or the cessation of
blood loss from a damaged blood vessel. Platelets are central in this process. Initially, there is vasospasm of the
damaged blood vessel to prevent further blood loss. The next step involves the formation of a platelet–fibrin plug at
the site of the puncture. The creation of an unwanted thrombus involves many of the same steps as normal clot
formation, except that the triggering stimulus is a pathologic condition in the vascular system, rather than external
physical trauma.

A.  Resting platelets
Platelets act as vascular sentries, monitoring the integrity of the vascular endothelium. In the absence of injury,
resting platelets circulate freely, because the balance of chemical signals indicates that the vascular system is not
damaged (Figure 21.2).
779

triphosphate; cAMP = cyclic adenosine monophosphate; (Figure continues on next
page)Figure 21.2 (continued)ADP = adenosine diphosphate; PAF = platelet activation
factor.
1.  Chemical mediators synthesized by endothelial cells
Prostacyclin is synthesized by intact endothelial cells and acts as an inhibitor of platelet aggregation. Prostacyclin
(also known as prostaglandin I2) binds to platelet membrane receptors that are coupled to the synthesis of cyclic
adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), an intracellular messenger (Figure 21.2). Elevated levels of intracellular cAMP
are associated with a decrease in intracellular calcium. Decreased intracellular calcium prevents platelet activation
and the subsequent release of platelet aggregation agents. Damaged endothelial cells synthesize less prostacyclin
than healthy cells. With less prostacyclin to bind platelet receptors, less intracellular cAMP is synthesized; this leads
to platelet aggregation.
2.  Roles of thrombin, thromboxanes, and collagen
The platelet membrane also contains receptors that can bind thrombin, thromboxanes, and exposed collagen. In the
intact, normal vessel, circulating levels of thrombin and thromboxane are low, and the intact endothelium covers
collagen in the subendothelial layers. The corresponding platelet receptors are, thus, unoccupied, and as a result,
platelet activation and aggregation are not initiated. However, when occupied, each of these receptor types triggers a
series of reactions leading to the release into the circulation of intracellular granules by the platelets. This ultimately
stimulates platelet aggregation.780

--- PAGE 781 ---

781

--- PAGE 782 ---

B.  Platelet adhesion
When the endothelium is injured, platelets adhere to and virtually cover the exposed collagen of the subendothelium
(Figure 21.2). This triggers a complex series of chemical reactions, resulting in platelet activation.
782
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 783 ---

C.  Platelet activation
Receptors on the surface of the adhering platelets are activated by the collagen of the underlying connective tissue.
This causes morphologic changes in platelets (Figure 21.3) and the release of platelet granules containing chemical
mediators, such as adenosine diphosphate (ADP), thromboxane A2, serotonin, platelet activation factor, and
thrombin (Figure 21.2). These signaling molecules bind to receptors in the outer membrane of resting platelets
circulating nearby. These receptors function as sensors that are activated by the signals sent from the adhering
platelets. The previously dormant platelets become activated and start to aggregate. These actions are mediated by
several messenger systems that ultimately result in elevated levels of calcium and a decreased concentration of
cAMP within the platelet.
Figure 21.3 Scanning electron micrograph of platelets.
783
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 784 ---

D.  Platelet aggregation
The increase in cytosolic calcium accompanying activation is due to a release of sequestered stores within the
platelet (Figure 21.2). This leads to 1) the release of platelet granules containing mediators, such as ADP and
serotonin that activate other platelets; 2) activation of thromboxane A2 synthesis; and 3) activation of glycoprotein
(GP) IIb/IIIa receptors that bind fibrinogen and, ultimately, regulate platelet–platelet interaction and thrombus
formation. Fibrinogen, a soluble plasma GP, simultaneously binds to GP IIb/IIIa receptors on two separate platelets,
resulting in platelet cross-linking and platelet aggregation. This leads to an avalanche of platelet aggregation,
because each activated platelet can recruit other platelets (Figure 21.4).
Figure 21.4 Activation and aggregation of platelets. GP = glycoprotein.
784
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 785 ---

E.  Formation of a clot
Local stimulation of the coagulation cascade by tissue factors released from the injured tissue and by mediators on
the surface of platelets results in the formation of thrombin (factor IIa). In turn, thrombin, a serine protease,
catalyzes the hydrolysis of fibrinogen to fibrin, which is incorporated into the clot. Subsequent cross-linking of the
fibrin strands stabilizes the clot and forms a hemostatic platelet–fibrin plug (Figure 21.2).
785
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 786 ---

F.  Fibrinolysis
During clot formation, the fibrinolytic pathway is locally activated. Plasminogen is enzymatically processed to
plasmin (fibrinolysin) by plasminogen activators in the tissue (Figure 21.2). Plasmin limits the growth of the clot
and dissolves the fibrin network as wounds heal.
786

--- PAGE 787 ---

IV.  Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors
Platelet aggregation inhibitors decrease the formation of a platelet-rich clot or decrease the action of chemical
signals that promote platelet aggregation (Figure 21.5). The platelet aggregation inhibitors described below inhibit
cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), block GP IIb/IIIa, or block ADP receptors, thereby interfering with the signals that
promote platelet aggregation. These agents are beneficial in the prevention and treatment of occlusive cardiovascular
diseases, in the maintenance of vascular grafts and arterial patency, and as adjuncts to thrombin inhibitors or
thrombolytic therapy in MI.

inhibitor.

A.  Aspirin
1.  Mechanism of action
Stimulation of platelets by thrombin, collagen, and ADP results in activation of platelet membrane phospholipases
that liberate arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids. Arachidonic acid is first converted to prostaglandin H2
by COX-1 (Figure 21.6). Prostaglandin H2 is further metabolized to thromboxane A2, which is released into plasma.
Thromboxane A2 promotes the aggregation process that is essential for the rapid formation of a hemostatic plug.
Aspirin [AS-pir-in] inhibits thromboxane A2 synthesis by acetylation of a serine residue on the active site of COX-1,
thereby irreversibly inactivating the enzyme (Figure 21.7). This shifts the balance of chemical mediators to favor the
antiaggregatory effects of prostacyclin, thereby preventing platelet aggregation. The inhibitory effect is rapid, and
aspirin-induced suppression of thromboxane A2 and the resulting suppression of platelet aggregation last for the life
of the platelet, which is approximately 7 to 10 days. Repeated administration of aspirin has a cumulative effect on
the function of platelets. Aspirin is the only antiplatelet agent that irreversibly inhibits platelet function.
Figure 21.6 Aspirin irreversibly inhibits platelet cyclooxygenase-1.
788
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 789 ---

Figure 21.7 Acetylation of cyclooxygenase-1 by aspirin.
2.  Therapeutic use
Aspirin is used in the prophylactic treatment of transient cerebral ischemia, to reduce the incidence of recurrent MI,
and to decrease mortality in the setting of primary and secondary prevention of MI. Complete inactivation of
platelets occurs with 75 mg of aspirin given daily. The recommended antiplatelet dose of aspirin ranges from 50 to
325 mg daily.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
When given orally, aspirin is absorbed by passive diffusion and quickly hydrolyzed to salicylic acid in the liver.
Salicylic acid is further metabolized in the liver and some is excreted unchanged in the urine. The half-life of aspirin
ranges from 15 to 20 minutes and for salicylic acid is 3 to 12 hours.
4.  Adverse effects
Higher doses of aspirin increase drug-related toxicities as well as the probability that aspirin may also inhibit
prostacyclin production. Bleeding time is prolonged by aspirin treatment, causing complications that include an
increased incidence of hemorrhagic stroke and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially at higher doses of the drug.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, inhibit COX-1 by transiently competing at the catalytic

site. Ibuprofen, if taken within the 2 hours prior to aspirin, can obstruct the access of aspirin to the serine residue
and, thereby, antagonize platelet inhibition by aspirin. Therefore, immediate-release aspirin should be taken at least
60 minutes before or at least 8 hours after ibuprofen.

B.  P2Y 12 receptor antagonists
Ticlopidine [ti-KLOE-pi-deen], clopidogrel  [kloh-PID-oh-grel], prasugrel  [PRA-soo-grel], ticagrelor [tye-KA-grel-
or], and cangrelor [KAN-grel-or] are P2Y12 ADP receptor inhibitors that also block platelet aggregation but by a
mechanism different from that of aspirin. All of these agents are administered orally, with the exception of
cangrelor, which is an injectable formulation.
1.  Mechanism of action
These drugs inhibit the binding of ADP to the P2Y12 receptor on platelets and, thereby, inhibit the activation of the
GP IIb/IIIa receptors required for platelets to bind to fibrinogen and to each other (Figure 21.8). Ticagrelor and
cangrelor bind to the P2Y12 ADP receptor in a reversible manner. The other agents bind irreversibly. The maximum
inhibition of platelet aggregation is achieved in 2 minutes with intravenous (IV) cangrelor, 1 to 3 hours with
ticagrelor, 2 to 4 hours with prasugrel , 3 to 4 days with ticlopidine, and 3 to 5 days with clopidogrel . When
treatment is suspended, the platelet system requires time to recover.
Figure 21.8 Mechanism of action of P2Y12 receptor antagonists. ADP = adenine
diphosphate; GP = glycoprotein.
2.  Therapeutic use
Clopidogrel  is approved for prevention of atherosclerotic events in patients with a recent MI or stroke and in those
with established peripheral arterial disease. It is also approved for prophylaxis of thrombotic events in acute
coronary syndromes (unstable angina or non–ST-elevation MI). Additionally, clopidogrel  is used to prevent
thrombotic events associated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with or without coronary stenting.
Ticlopidine is similar in structure to clopidogrel . It is indicated for the prevention of transient ischemic attacks (TIA)
and strokes in patients with a prior cerebral thrombotic event. However, due to life-threatening hematologic adverse
reactions, ticlopidine is generally reserved for patients who are intolerant to other therapies. Prasugrel  is approved
to decrease thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina, non–ST-
elevation MI, and ST-elevation MI managed with PCI). Ticagrelor is approved for the prevention of arterial
thromboembolism in patients with unstable angina and acute MI, including those undergoing PCI. Cangrelor is
approved as an adjunct during PCI to reduce thrombotic events in select patients.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
These agents require oral loading doses for quicker antiplatelet effect, except cangrelor that has a fast onset of791
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 792 ---

action with intravenous administration. Food interferes with the absorption of ticlopidine but not with the other
agents. After oral ingestion, the drugs are extensively bound to plasma proteins. They undergo hepatic metabolism
by the cytochrome P-450 (CYP) system to active metabolites. Elimination of the drugs and metabolites occurs by
both the renal and fecal routes. Clopidogrel  is a prodrug, and its therapeutic efficacy relies on its active metabolite,
which is produced via metabolism by CYP 2C19. Genetic polymorphism of CYP 2C19 leads to a reduced clinical
response in patients who are “poor metabolizers” of clopidogrel . Tests are currently available to identify poor
metabolizers, and it is recommended that other antiplatelet agents (prasugrel  or ticagrelor) be prescribed for these
patients. In addition, other drugs that inhibit CYP 2C19, such as omeprazole and esomeprazole, should be avoided
while on clopidogrel .
4.  Adverse effects
These agents can cause prolonged bleeding for which there is no antidote. Ticlopidine is associated with severe
hematologic reactions that limit its use, such as agranulocytosis, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), and
aplastic anemia. Clopidogrel  causes fewer adverse reactions, and the incidence of neutropenia is lower. However,
TTP has been reported as an adverse effect for both clopidogrel  and prasugrel  (but not for ticagrelor). Prasugrel  is
contraindicated in patients with history of TIA or stroke. Prasugrel , ticagrelor, and cangrelor carry black box
warnings for bleeding. Additionally, ticagrelor carries a black box warning for diminished effectiveness with
concomitant use of aspirin doses above 100 mg.

C.  Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors
1.  Mechanism of action
The GP IIb/IIIa receptor plays a key role in stimulating platelet aggregation. A chimeric monoclonal antibody
fragment, abciximab [ab-SIKS-eh-mab], inhibits the GP IIb/IIIa receptor complex. By binding to GP IIb/IIIa,
abciximab blocks the binding of fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor and, consequently, aggregation does not
occur (Figure 21.9). Eptifibatide [ep-ti-FIB-ih-tide] and tirofiban [tye-roe-FYE-ban] act similarly to abciximab, by
blocking the GP IIb/IIIa receptor. Eptifibatide is a cyclic peptide that binds to GP IIb/IIIa at the site that interacts
with the arginine–glycine–aspartic acid sequence of fibrinogen. Tirofiban is not a peptide, but it blocks the same site
as eptifibatide.
Figure 21.9 Mechanism of action of glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor blockers.
2.  Therapeutic use
These agents are given intravenously, along with heparin and aspirin, as an adjunct to PCI for the prevention of
cardiac ischemic complications. Abciximab is also approved for patients with unstable angina not responding to
conventional medical therapy when PCI is planned within 24 hours.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
Abciximab is given by IV bolus, followed by IV infusion, achieving peak platelet inhibition within 30 minutes. The
metabolism of abciximab is unknown. After cessation of abciximab infusion, platelet function gradually returns to
normal, with the antiplatelet effect persisting for 24 to 48 hours. When IV infusion of eptifibatide or tirofiban is
stopped, both agents are rapidly cleared from the plasma. Eptifibatide and its metabolites are excreted by the kidney.
Tirofiban is excreted largely unchanged by the kidney and to a lesser extent in the feces.

4.  Adverse effects
The major adverse effect of these agents is bleeding, especially if used with anticoagulants.

D.  Dipyridamole
Dipyridamole [dye-peer-ID-a-mole], a coronary vasodilator, increases intracellular levels of cAMP by inhibiting
phosphodiesterase, thereby resulting in decreased thromboxane A2 synthesis. The drug may potentiate the effect of
prostacyclin and, therefore, decrease platelet adhesion to thrombogenic surfaces (Figure 21.2). Dipyridamole is used
for stroke prevention and is usually given in combination with aspirin. Dipyridamole has variable bioavailability
following oral administration. It is highly protein bound. The drug undergoes hepatic metabolism, mainly
glucuronidation, and is excreted primarily in the feces. Patients with unstable angina should not use dipyridamole
because of its vasodilating properties, which may worsen ischemia (coronary steal phenomenon). Dipyridamole
commonly causes headache and dizziness and can lead to orthostatic hypotension (especially if administered IV).
795
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 796 ---

E.  Cilostazol
Cilostazol  [sill-AH-sta-zole] is an oral antiplatelet agent that also has vasodilating activity. Cilostazol  and its active
metabolites inhibit phosphodiesterase type III, which prevents the degradation of cAMP, thereby increasing levels of
cAMP in platelets and vascular tissues. The increase in cAMP prevents platelet aggregation and promotes
vasodilation of blood vessels, respectively. Cilostazol  is approved to reduce the symptoms of intermittent
claudication. Cilostazol  is extensively metabolized in the liver by the CYP 3A4 and 2C19 isoenzymes. As such, this
agent has many drug interactions that require dose modification. The primary route of elimination is via the kidney.
Headache and GI side effects (diarrhea, abnormal stools, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain) are the most common
adverse effects observed with cilostazol . Rarely, thrombocytopenia or leukopenia has been reported.
Phosphodiesterase type III inhibitors have been shown to increase mortality in patients with advanced heart failure.
As such, cilostazol  is contraindicated in patients with heart failure.

V.  Blood Coagulation
The coagulation process that generates thrombin consists of two interrelated pathways, the extrinsic and the intrinsic
systems. The extrinsic system is initiated by the activation of clotting factor VII by tissue factor (also known as
thromboplastin). Tissue factor is a membrane protein that is normally separated from the blood by the endothelial
cells that line the vasculature. However, in response to vascular injury, tissue factor becomes exposed to blood.
There, it can bind and activate factor VII, initiating the extrinsic pathway. The intrinsic system is triggered by the
activation of clotting factor XII. This occurs when blood comes into contact with the collagen in the damaged wall
of a blood vessel.
797
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 798 ---

A.  Formation of fibrin
Both the extrinsic and the intrinsic systems involve a cascade of enzyme reactions that sequentially transform
various plasma factors (proenzymes) to their active (enzymatic) forms. [Note: The active form of a clotting factor is
denoted by the letter “a.”] Ultimately, factor Xa is produced, which converts prothrombin (factor II) to thrombin
(factor IIa; Figure 21.10).Thrombin plays a key role in coagulation, because it is responsible for generation of fibrin,
which forms the mesh-like matrix of the blood clot. If thrombin is not formed or if its function is impeded (for
example, by antithrombin III), coagulation is inhibited.

B.  Inhibitors of coagulation
It is important that coagulation is restricted to the local site of vascular injury. Endogenously, protein C, protein S,
antithrombin III, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor all inhibit coagulation factors. The mechanism of action of
several anticoagulant agents, including heparin and heparin-related products, involves activation of these
endogenous inhibitors (primarily antithrombin III).

--- PAGE 801 ---

VI.  Parenteral Anticoagulants
The anticoagulant drugs inhibit either the action of the coagulation factors (for example, heparin) or interfere with
the synthesis of the coagulation factors (warfarin).

--- PAGE 802 ---

A.  Heparin and low molecular weight heparins
Heparin [HEP-a-rin] is an injectable, rapidly acting anticoagulant that is often used acutely to interfere with the
formation of thrombi. Heparin occurs naturally as a macromolecule complexed with histamine in mast cells, where
its physiologic role is unknown. It is extracted for commercial use from porcine intestinal mucosa. Unfractionated
heparin is a mixture of straight-chain, anionic glycosaminoglycans with a wide range of molecular weights. It is
strongly acidic because of the presence of sulfate and carboxylic acid groups. The realization that low molecular
weight forms of heparin (LMWHs) can also act as anticoagulants led to the isolation of enoxaparin [e-NOX-a-par-
in] and dalteparin [DAL-te-PAR-in], produced by depolymerization of unfractionated heparin. The LMWHs are
heterogeneous compounds about one-third the size of unfractionated heparin.
1.  Mechanism of action
Heparin acts at a number of molecular targets, but its anticoagulant effect is a consequence of binding to
antithrombin III, with the subsequent rapid inactivation of coagulation factors (Figure 21.11). Antithrombin III is an
α globulin that inhibits serine proteases of thrombin (factor IIa) and factor Xa. In the absence of heparin,
antithrombin III interacts very slowly with thrombin and factor Xa. When heparin molecules bind to antithrombin
III, a conformational change occurs that catalyzes the inhibition of thrombin about 1000-fold. LMWHs complex
with antithrombin III and inactivate factor Xa (including that located on platelet surfaces) but do not bind as avidly
to thrombin. A unique pentasaccharide sequence contained in heparin and LMWHs permits their binding to
antithrombin III (Figure 21.12).
Figure 21.11 Heparin accelerates inactivation of coagulation factors by antithrombin.
Figure 21.12 Heparin-mediated and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)-mediated
inactivation of thrombin or factor Xa.
2.  Therapeutic use
Heparin and the LMWHs limit the expansion of thrombi by preventing fibrin formation. These agents are used for
the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism (DVT or PE). Heparin and LMWHs are also used for prophylaxis
of postoperative venous thrombosis in patients undergoing surgery (for example, hip replacement) and those with
acute MI. These drugs are the anticoagulants of choice for treating pregnant women, because they do not cross the
placenta, due to their large size and negative charge. LMWHs do not require the same intense monitoring as
heparin, thereby saving laboratory costs and nursing time. These advantages make LMWHs useful for both inpatient
and outpatient therapy.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
Heparin must be administered subcutaneously or intravenously, because the drug does not readily cross membranes
(Figure 21.13). The LMWHs are usually administered subcutaneously. [Note: Enoxaparin can be administered802
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 803 ---

intravenously in the treatment of MI.] Heparin is often initiated as an intravenous bolus to achieve immediate
anticoagulation. This is followed by lower doses or continuous infusion of heparin, titrated to the desired level of
anticoagulation according to the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) or anti-Xa level. Whereas the
anticoagulant effect with heparin occurs within minutes of IV administration (or 1 to 2 hours after subcutaneous
injection), the maximum anti–factor Xa activity of the LMWHs occurs about 4 hours after subcutaneous injection. It
is usually not necessary to monitor coagulation values with LMWHs because the plasma levels and
pharmacokinetics of these drugs are more predictable. However, in renally impaired, pregnant, and obese patients,
monitoring of factor Xa levels is recommended with LMWHs. In the blood, heparin binds to many proteins that
neutralize its activity, causing unpredictable pharmacokinetics. Heparin binding to plasma proteins is variable in
patients with thromboembolic diseases. Although generally restricted to the circulation, heparin is taken up by the
monocyte/macrophage system, and it undergoes depolymerization and desulfation to inactive products. The inactive
metabolites, as well as some of the parent heparin undergo renal excretion. The LMWHs are primarily eliminated in
the urine. Therefore, renal insufficiency prolongs the half-life of LMWH, and the dose of LMWH should be reduced
in patients with renal impairment. The half-life of heparin is approximately 1.5 hours, whereas the half-life of the
LMWHs is longer than that of heparin, ranging from 3 to 12 hours.
Figure 21.13 Administration and fate of heparin and low molecular weight heparins
(LMWHs).
4.  Adverse effects
The chief complication of heparin and LMWH therapy is bleeding (Figure 21.14). Careful monitoring of the patient
and laboratory parameters is required to minimize bleeding. Excessive bleeding may be managed by discontinuing
the drug or by treating with protamine sulfate. When infused slowly, the latter combines ionically with heparin to
form a stable, 1:1 inactive complex. It is important that the dosage of protamine sulfate is carefully titrated (1 mg for
every 100 units of heparin administered), because protamine sulfate is a weak anticoagulant, and excess amounts
may trigger bleeding episodes or worsen bleeding potential. Heparin preparations are obtained from porcine sources
and, therefore, may be antigenic. Possible adverse reactions include chills, fever, urticaria, and anaphylactic shock.
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious condition, in which circulating blood contains an abnormally
low number of platelets. This reaction is immune mediated and carries a risk of venous and arterial embolism.
Heparin therapy should be discontinued when patients develop HIT or show severe thrombocytopenia. In cases of
HIT, heparin can be replaced by another anticoagulant, such as argatroban. [Note: LMWHs can have cross-
sensitivity and are not recommended in patients with HIT.] In addition, osteoporosis has been observed in patients
on long-term heparin therapy. Heparin and LMWHs are contraindicated in patients who have hypersensitivity to
heparin, bleeding disorders, alcoholism, or who have had recent surgery of the brain, eye, or spinal cord.

B.  Argatroban
Argatroban [ar-GA-troh-ban] is a synthetic parenteral anticoagulant that is derived from L-arginine. It is a direct
thrombin inhibitor. Argatroban is used for the prophylaxis or treatment of venous thromboembolism in patients with
HIT, and it is also approved for use during PCI in patients who have or are at risk for developing HIT. Anticoagulant
effects are immediate. Argatroban is metabolized in the liver and has a half-life of about 39 to 51 minutes. Dose
reduction is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment. Monitoring includes aPTT, hemoglobin, and
hematocrit. As with other anticoagulants, the major side effect is bleeding.

C.  Bivalirudin and desirudin
Bivalirudin [bye-VAL-ih-ruh-din] and desirudin [deh-SIHR-uh-din] are parenteral anticoagulants that are analogs of
hirudin, a thrombin inhibitor derived from saliva of the medicinal leech. These drugs are selective direct thrombin
inhibitors that reversibly inhibit the catalytic site of both free and clot-bound thrombin. Bivalirudin is an alternative
to heparin in patients undergoing PCI who have or are at risk for developing HIT and also in patients with unstable
angina undergoing angioplasty. In patients with normal renal function, the half-life of bivalirudin is 25 minutes.
Dosage adjustments are required in patients with renal impairment. Desirudin is indicated for the prevention of DVT
in patients undergoing hip replacement surgery. Like the others, bleeding is the major side effect of these agents.

D.  Fondaparinux
Fondaparinux [fawn-da-PARE-eh-nux] is a synthetically derived pentasaccharide anticoagulant that selectively
inhibits factor Xa. By selectively binding to antithrombin III, fondaparinux potentiates (300- to 1000-fold) the innate
neutralization of factor Xa by antithrombin III. Fondaparinux is approved for use in the treatment of DVT and PE
and for the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in the setting of orthopedic and abdominal surgery. The drug is
well absorbed from the subcutaneous route with a predictable pharmacokinetic profile and, therefore, requires less
monitoring than heparin. Fondaparinux is eliminated in the urine mainly as unchanged drug with an elimination
half-life of 17 to 21 hours. It is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment. Bleeding is the major side
effect of fondaparinux. There is no available agent for the reversal of bleeding associated with fondaparinux. HIT is
less likely with fondaparinux than with heparin but is still a possibility.

VII.  Vitamin K Antagonists
Coumarin anticoagulants owe their action to the ability to antagonize the cofactor functions of vitamin K. The only
coumarin anticoagulant available in the United States is warfarin [WAR-far-in]. The international normalized ratio
(INR) is the standard by which the anticoagulant activity of warfarin therapy is monitored. Warfarin has a narrow
therapeutic index. Therefore, it is important that the INR is maintained within the optimal range as much as possible,
and frequent monitoring may be required.
808
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 809 ---

A.  Warfarin
1.  Mechanism of action
Factors II, VII, IX, and X (Figure 21.10) require vitamin K as a cofactor for their synthesis by the liver. These
factors undergo vitamin K–dependent posttranslational modification, whereby a number of their glutamic acid
residues are carboxylated to form γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues (Figure 21.15). The γ-carboxyglutamyl residues
bind calcium ions, which are essential for interaction between the coagulation factors and platelet membranes. In the
carboxylation reactions, the vitamin K–dependent carboxylase fixes CO2 to form the new COOH group on glutamic
acid. The reduced vitamin K cofactor is converted to vitamin K epoxide during the reaction. Vitamin K is
regenerated from the epoxide by vitamin K epoxide reductase, the enzyme that is inhibited by warfarin. Warfarin
treatment results in the production of clotting factors with diminished activity (10% to 40% of normal), due to the
lack of sufficient γ-carboxyglutamyl side chains. Unlike heparin, the anticoagulant effects of warfarin are not
observed immediately after drug administration. Instead, peak effects may be delayed for 72 to 96 hours, which is
the time required to deplete the pool of circulating clotting factors. The anticoagulant effects of warfarin can be
overcome by the administration of vitamin K . However, reversal following administration of vitamin K  takes
approximately 24 hours (the time necessary for degradation of already synthesized clotting factors).

adenine dinucleotide phosphate; NADPH = reduced form of nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate.

--- PAGE 810 ---

2.  Therapeutic use
Warfarin is used in the prevention and treatment of DVT and PE, stroke prevention, stroke prevention in the setting
of atrial fibrillation and/or prosthetic heart valves, protein C and S deficiency, and antiphospholipid syndrome. It is
also used for prevention of venous thromboembolism following orthopedic surgery.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
Warfarin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration (100% bioavailability with little individual patient variation).
Warfarin is highly bound to plasma albumin, which prevents its diffusion into the cerebrospinal fluid, urine, and
breast milk. However, drugs that have a greater affinity for the albumin-binding site, such as sulfonamides, can
displace the anticoagulant and lead to a transient, elevated activity. Drugs that affect warfarin binding to plasma
proteins can lead to variability in the therapeutic response to warfarin. Warfarin readily crosses the placental barrier.
The mean half-life of warfarin is approximately 40 hours, but this value is highly variable among individuals.
Warfarin is metabolized by the CYP450 system (mainly CYP2C9) to inactive components. After conjugation to
glucuronic acid, the inactive metabolites are excreted in urine and feces. Agents that affect the metabolism of
warfarin may alter its therapeutic effects. Warfarin has numerous drug interactions that may potentiate or attenuate
its anticoagulant effect. The list of interacting drugs is extensive. A summary of some of the important interactions
is shown in Figure 21.16.

Figure 21.16 Drugs affecting the anticoagulant effect of warfarin.
4.  Adverse effects
The principal adverse effect of warfarin is bleeding. Minor bleeding may be treated by withdrawal of the drug or
administration of oral vitamin K , but severe bleeding may require greater doses of vitamin K  given intravenously.
Whole blood, frozen plasma, and plasma concentrates of blood factors may also be used for rapid reversal of
warfarin. Skin lesions and necrosis are rare complications of warfarin therapy. Purple toe syndrome, a rare, painful,
blue-tinged discoloration of the toe caused by cholesterol emboli from plaques, has also been observed with
warfarin therapy. Warfarin is teratogenic and is contraindicated in pregnancy.

VIII.  Direct Oral Anticoagulants
813
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 814 ---

A.  Dabigatran
1.  Mechanism of action
Dabigatran etexilate [da-bi-GAT-ran e-TEX-i-late] is the prodrug of the active moiety dabigatran, which is an oral
direct thrombin inhibitor. Both clot-bound thrombin and free thrombin are inhibited by dabigatran.
2.  Therapeutic use
Dabigatran is approved for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial
fibrillation. It may also be used in the treatment of DVT and PE in patients who have already received parenteral
anticoagulants and as prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the risk of recurrence of DVT and PE. The drug is
contraindicated in patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves and is not recommended in patients with
bioprosthetic heart valves.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
Dabigatran etexilate is administered orally. It is hydrolyzed to the active drug, dabigatran, by various plasma
esterases. Dabigatran is metabolized by esterases. It is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and is eliminated
renally.
4.  Adverse effects
The major adverse effect, like other anticoagulants, is bleeding. Dabigatran should be used with caution in renal
impairment or in patients over the age of 75, as the risk of bleeding is higher in these groups. Idarucizumab may be
used to reverse bleeding in severe cases. GI adverse effects are common with dabigatran and may include
dyspepsia, abdominal pain, esophagitis, and GI bleeding. Abrupt discontinuation should be avoided, as patients may
be at increased risk for thrombotic events.
814
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 815 ---

B.  Direct oral factor Xa inhibitors
1.  Mechanism of action
Apixaban [a-PIX-a-ban], betrixaban [be-TRIX-a-ban], edoxaban [e-DOX-a-ban], and rivaroxaban [RIV-a-ROX-a-
ban] are oral inhibitors of factor Xa. Inhibition of factor Xa reduces the production of thrombin (IIa) from
prothrombin (Figure 21.10).
2.  Therapeutic use
With the exception of betrixaban, these agents are approved for prevention of stroke in nonvalvular atrial
fibrillation, as well as the treatment of DVT and PE. Rivaroxaban and apixaban are also used as prophylaxis to
prevent or reduce the risk of recurrence of DVT and PE. Betrixaban is indicated for the prophylaxis of DVT and PE
in at-risk hospitalized medical patients.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
These drugs are adequately absorbed after oral administration. Rivaroxaban is metabolized by the CYP 3A4/5 and
CYP 2J2 isoenzymes to inactive metabolites. About one-third of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine, and the
inactive metabolites are excreted in the urine and feces. Apixaban is primarily metabolized by CYP 3A4, with CYP
enzymes 1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2J2 all sharing minor metabolic roles; approximately 27% is excreted renally.
Edoxaban and betrixaban are minimally metabolized and are eliminated primarily unchanged in the urine and feces,
respectively. All of these drugs are substrates of P-gp, and dosages should be reduced (in some cases concomitant
use should be avoided) with P-gp inhibitors such as clarithromycin, verapamil , and amiodarone. Concomitant
administration of apixaban and rivaroxaban with drugs that are strong P-gp and CYP 3A4 inducers (for example,
phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, St. John’s wort ) should be avoided due to the potential for reduced efficacy of
the factor Xa inhibitors.
4.  Adverse effects
Bleeding is the most serious adverse effect. Currently there is no antidote, but recombinant factor Xa products are in
development. Declining kidney function can prolong the effect of these drugs and, therefore, increase the risk of
bleeding. Renal dosage adjustments are recommended for these agents. Abrupt discontinuation of the factor Xa
inhibitors should be avoided.

IX.  Thrombolytic Drugs
Acute thromboembolic disease in selected patients may be treated by the administration of drugs that activate the
conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, a serine protease that hydrolyzes fibrin and, thus, dissolves clots.
816
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 817 ---

A.  Common characteristics of thrombolytic agents
1.  Mechanism of action
The thrombolytic agents act either directly or indirectly to convert plasminogen to plasmin, which, in turn, cleaves
fibrin, thus lysing thrombi (Figure 21.17). Clot dissolution and reperfusion occur with a higher frequency when
therapy is initiated early after clot formation because clots become more resistant to lysis as they age. Unfortunately,
increased local thrombi may occur as the clot dissolves, leading to enhanced platelet aggregation and thrombosis.
Strategies to prevent this include administration of antiplatelet drugs, such as aspirin, or antithrombotics such as
heparin.
Figure 21.17 Activation of plasminogen by thrombolytic drugs.
2.  Therapeutic use
Originally used for the treatment of DVT and serious PE, thrombolytic drugs are currently used less frequently
because of tendency to cause serious bleeding. For MI, intracoronary delivery of the drugs is the most reliable in
terms of achieving recanalization. However, cardiac catheterization may not be possible in the 2- to 6-hour
“therapeutic window,” beyond which significant myocardial salvage becomes less likely. Thus, thrombolytic agents
are usually administered intravenously. Thrombolytic agents are helpful in restoring catheter and shunt function, by
lysing clots causing occlusions. They are also used to dissolve clots that result in strokes.
3.  Adverse effects
Thrombolytic agents do not distinguish between the fibrin of an unwanted thrombus and the fibrin of a beneficial
hemostatic plug. Thus, hemorrhage is a major adverse effect. For example, a previously unsuspected lesion, such as
a gastric ulcer, may hemorrhage following injection of a thrombolytic agent (Figure 21.18). These drugs are
contraindicated in pregnancy and in patients with healing wounds, a history of cerebrovascular accident, brain
tumor, head trauma, intracranial bleeding, and metastatic cancer.

plasminogen activators.

--- PAGE 819 ---

B.  Alteplase and tenecteplase
Alteplase [AL-teh-place] (formerly known as tissue plasminogen activator or tPA) is a serine protease originally
derived from cultured human melanoma cells. It is now obtained as a product of recombinant DNA technology.
Tenecteplase [ten-EK-te-place] is recombinant tPA with a longer half-life and greater binding affinity for fibrin than
alteplase. Alteplase has a low affinity for free plasminogen in the plasma, but it rapidly activates plasminogen that is
bound to fibrin in a thrombus or a hemostatic plug. Thus, alteplase is said to be “fibrin selective” at low doses.
Alteplase is approved for the treatment of MI, massive PE, and acute ischemic stroke. Tenecteplase is approved only
for use in acute MI.
Alteplase has a very short half-life (5 to 30 minutes), and therefore, a portion of the total dose is injected
intravenously as a bolus, and the remaining drug is administered over 1 to 3 hours, depending on the indication.
Tenecteplase has a longer half-life and, therefore, may be administered as an intravenous bolus. Alteplase may cause
angioedema, and there may be an increased risk of this effect when combined with angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE) inhibitors.

X.  Drugs Used to Treat Bleeding
Bleeding problems may have their origin in naturally occurring pathologic conditions, such as hemophilia, or as a
result of fibrinolytic states that may arise after surgery. The use of anticoagulants may also give rise to hemorrhage.
Certain natural proteins and vitamin K , as well as synthetic antagonists, are effective in controlling this bleeding
(Figure 21.19). Concentrated preparations of coagulation factors are available from human donors. However, these
preparations carry the risk of transferring viral infections. Blood transfusion is also an option for treating severe
hemorrhage.

thromboplastin time, CBC = complete blood count, CVA = cerebrovascular accident,
INR = international normalized ratio, PT = prothrombin time.

--- PAGE 821 ---

A.  Aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid
Fibrinolytic states can be controlled by the administration of aminocaproic [a-mee-noe-ka-PROE-ic] acid or
tranexamic [tran-ex-AM-ic] acid. Both agents are synthetic, orally active, excreted in the urine, and inhibit
plasminogen activation. Tranexamic acid is 10 times more potent than aminocaproic acid. A potential side effect is
intravascular thrombosis.
821
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 822 ---

B.  Protamine sulfate
Protamine [PROE-ta-meen] sulfate antagonizes the anticoagulant effects of heparin. This protein is derived from
fish sperm or testes and is high in arginine content, which explains its basicity. The positively charged protamine
interacts with the negatively charged heparin, forming a stable complex without anticoagulant activity. Adverse
effects of drug administration include hypersensitivity as well as dyspnea, flushing, bradycardia, and hypotension
when rapidly injected.
822
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 823 ---

C.  Vitamin K
Vitamin K1 (phytonadione) administration can stop bleeding problems due to warfarin by increasing the supply of
active vitamin K1, thereby inhibiting the effect of warfarin. Vitamin K1 may be administered via the oral,
subcutaneous, or intravenous route. [Note: Intravenous vitamin K  should be administered by slow IV infusion to
minimize the risk of hypersensitivity or anaphylactoid reactions.] For the treatment of bleeding, the subcutaneous
route of vitamin K1 is less preferred, as it is not as effective as oral or IV administration. The response to vitamin K1
is slow, requiring about 24 hours to reduce INR (time to synthesize new coagulation factors). Thus, if immediate
hemostasis is required, fresh frozen plasma should be infused.
823

--- PAGE 824 ---

D.  Idarucizumab
Idarucizumab [EYE-da-roo-KIZ-ue-mab] is a monoclonal antibody fragment used to reverse bleeding caused by
dabigatran. By binding to dabigatran and its metabolites, idarucizumab neutralizes anticoagulation. Idarucizumab
is administered intravenously and is rapidly eliminated. Idarucizumab is used in emergency situations, in the
inpatient setting. Because it reverses the effect of dabigatran, thrombosis is the most serious adverse effect of
idarucizumab.

21.6Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
Which of the P2Y12 ADP receptor antagonists reversibly binds the receptor?
A.  Clopidogrel
B.  Prasugrel
C.  Ticagrelor
D.  Ticlopidine
Correct answer = C. Of the P2Y12 ADP receptor antagonists listed, ticagrelor is the only one that reversibly binds
the receptor. This is important when it comes to compliance. If a patient is not compliant, then the antiplatelet
activity of ticagrelor stops when the drug is missed (since the platelets are not irreversibly inhibited as they would
be with aspirin, clopidogrel, or prasugrel).
A 70-year-old woman is diagnosed with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Her past medical history is significant
for chronic kidney disease, and her renal function is moderately diminished. Which anticoagulant for atrial
fibrillation avoids the need for renal dose adjustment in this patient?
A.  Apixaban
B.  Dabigatran
C.  Rivaroxaban
D.  Warfarin
Correct answer = D. Warfarin does not require dosage adjustment in renal dysfunction. The INR is monitored and
dosage adjustments are made on the basis of this information. All of the other agents are renally cleared to some
extent and require dosage adjustments in renal dysfunction.
An 80-year-old man is taking warfarin indefinitely for the prevention of deep venous thrombosis. He is
compliant, has a stable INR, and denies bleeding or bruising. He is diagnosed with a urinary tract infection
and is prescribed sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. What are the expected effects on his warfarin therapy?
A.  Decreased anticoagulant effect of warfarin
B.  Increased anticoagulant effect of warfarin
C.  Activation of platelet activity
D.  No change in anticoagulation status
Correct answer = B. Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim has a significant drug interaction with warfarin, such that it
inhibits warfarin metabolism. Therefore, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim will cause increased anticoagulant
effects, and the patient will need to have his warfarin dose decreased and INR checked frequently while he is on
this antibiotic.
A 47-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with severe bleeding. Upon evaluation of the medical
record, you discover that she takes dabigatran for a history of multiple DVTs. What is the appropriate
reversal agent to administer to the patient at this time?
A.  Protamine
B.  Vitamin K
C.  Idarucizumab
D.  A reversal agent does not exist for this medication
Correct answer = C. Idarucizumab is used to reverse bleeding caused by dabigatran. By binding to dabigatran and
its metabolites, idarucizumab neutralizes anticoagulation. It would be important to monitor this patient for any
signs of thrombosis due to reversal of her anticoagulation. Vitamin K is the antidote for warfarin, and protamine
is the antidote for heparin.
Which must heparin bind to in order to exert its anticoagulant effect?
A.  GP IIb/IIIa receptor
B.  Thrombin
C.  Antithrombin III
D.  von Willebrand factor
Correct answer = C. Heparin binds to antithrombin III, causing a conformational change. This
heparin/antithrombin III complex then inactivates thrombin and factor Xa.
Which is considered “fibrin selective” because it rapidly activates plasminogen that is bound to fibrin?
A.  Alteplase
B.  Fondaparinux
C.  Argatroban
D.  Bivalirudin825
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 826 ---

21.7
21.8
21.9
21.10Correct answer = A. Alteplase has a low affinity for free plasminogen in the plasma, but it rapidly activates
plasminogen that is bound to fibrin in a thrombus or a hemostatic plug. It has the advantage of lysing only fibrin,
without unwanted degradation of other proteins (notably fibrinogen).
A 56-year-old man presents to the emergency room with complaints of swelling, redness, and pain in his
right leg. The patient is diagnosed with acute DVT, and the provider wants to start an oral agent. Which drug
is most appropriate for treatment of DVT in this patient?
A.  Rivaroxaban
B.  Betrixaban
C.  Enoxaparin
D.  Clopidogrel
Correct answer = A. Betrixaban is only approved for the prophylaxis of DVT and PE; it is not approved for the
treatment of acute DVT. Enoxaparin is used for the treatment of DVT, but it is an injectable medication.
Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet medication that is not appropriate for acute treatment of DVT.
Which is most appropriate for reversing the anticoagulant effects of heparin?
A.  Aminocaproic acid
B.  Protamine sulfate
C.  Vitamin K1
D.  Tranexamic acid
Correct answer = B. Excessive bleeding may be managed by ceasing administration of heparin or by treating with
protamine sulfate. Infused slowly, protamine sulfate combines ionically with heparin to form a stable, inactive
complex. Aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid are approved for the treatment of hemorrhage but do not
specifically reverse the effects of heparin to stop bleeding. Vitamin K1 is used to help reverse the effects of
warfarin-induced bleeding.
A 62-year-old man taking warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation presents to his primary care
physician with an elevated INR of 10.5 without bleeding. He is instructed to hold his warfarin dose and
given oral vitamin K1. When would the effects of vitamin K on the INR most likely be noted in this patient?
A.  1 hour
B.  6 hours
C.  24 hours
D.  72 hours
Correct answer = C. Vitamin K1 takes about 24 hours to see a reduction in the INR. This is due to the time
required for the body to synthesize new coagulation factors.
A 58-year-old man receives intravenous alteplase treatment for acute stroke. Five minutes following
completion of alteplase infusion, he develops angioedema. Which of the following drugs may have increased
the risk of developing angioedema in this patient?
A.  ACE inhibitor
B.  GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist
C.  Phosphodiesterase inhibitor
D.  Thiazide diuretic
Correct answer = A. ACE inhibitors, aspirin, and prasugrel  all have possible adverse effects including
angioedema. In the setting of alteplase administration, ACE inhibitors have been associated with an increased
risk of developing angioedema with concomitant use.826

Drugs for Hyperlipidemia
Karen Sando and Kevin Cowart

www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 828 ---

I.  Overview
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. CHD is correlated with elevated levels of
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides, and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(HDL-C). Other risk factors for CHD include cigarette smoking, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, chronic kidney
disease, and advanced age. Elevated cholesterol levels (hyperlipidemia) may be due to lifestyle factors (for example,
lack of exercise or diet containing excess saturated fats). Hyperlipidemia can also result from an inherited defect in
lipoprotein metabolism or, more commonly, from a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors. Appropriate
lifestyle changes, along with drug therapy, can lead to a 30% to 40% reduction in CHD mortality.
Antihyperlipidemic drugs (Figure 22.1) are often taken indefinitely to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in select patients and to control plasma lipid levels. [Note: ASCVD includes CHD,
stroke, and peripheral arterial disease.] Figure 22.2 illustrates the normal metabolism of serum lipoproteins and the
characteristics of the major genetic hyperlipidemias.

II.  Treatment Goals
Plasma lipids consist mostly of lipoproteins, which are spherical complexes of lipids and specific proteins. The
clinically important lipoproteins, listed in decreasing order of atherogenicity, are LDL, very–low-density lipoprotein
(VLDL) and chylomicrons, and HDL. The occurrence of CHD is positively associated with high total cholesterol
and has an even stronger correlation with elevated LDL-C. In contrast to LDL-C, high levels of HDL-C have been
associated with a decreased risk for CHD (Figure 22.3). According to cholesterol guidelines, the need for
antihyperlipidemic drug therapy should be determined based on an assessment of risk for ASCVD, in conjunction
with evaluation of lipoprotein levels (for example, LDL-C; Figure 22.4). [Note: Therapeutic lifestyle changes, such
as diet, exercise, and weight loss, may help reduce cholesterol levels; however, lifestyle modifications do not replace
the need for drug therapy in patients who fall into one of the four statin benefit groups (see Figure 22.4).]

III.  Drugs for Hyperlipidemia
Antihyperlipidemic drugs include the statins, niacin, fibrates, bile acid sequestrants, a cholesterol absorption
inhibitor, proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, and omega-3 fatty acids. These agents
may be used alone or in combination. However, drug therapy should always be accompanied by lifestyle
modifications, such as exercise and a diet low in saturated fats.

A.  HMG CoA reductase inhibitors
3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors (commonly known as statins) lower
LDL-C, resulting in a substantial reduction in coronary events and death from CHD. Therapeutic benefits include
atherosclerotic plaque stabilization, improvement of coronary endothelial function, inhibition of platelet thrombus
formation, and vascular anti-inflammatory activity. They are first-line treatment for patients with elevated risk of
ASCVD to reduce the occurrence of ASCVD events (see Figure 22.4). [Note: The intensity of statin therapy should
be guided by the patient’s absolute risk for an ASCVD event.]
1.  Mechanism of action
Lovastatin [LOE-vah-stat-in], simvastatin [sim-vah-STAT-in], pravastatin [PRAH-vah-stat-in], atorvastatin [a-
TOR-vah-stat-in], fluvastatin [FLOO-vah-stat-in], pitavastatin [pit-AV-a-STAT-in], and rosuvastatin [roe-SOO-va-
stat-in] are competitive inhibitors of HMG CoA reductase, the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis. By
inhibiting de novo cholesterol synthesis, they deplete the intracellular supply of cholesterol ( Figure 22.5). Depletion
of intracellular cholesterol causes the cell to increase the number of cell surface LDL receptors that can bind and
internalize circulating LDL-C. Thus, plasma cholesterol is reduced, by both decreased cholesterol synthesis and
increased LDL-C catabolism. Rosuvastatin and atorvastatin are the most potent LDL-C lowering statins, followed
by pitavastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and fluvastatin. [Note: Because these agents undergo a marked
first-pass extraction by the liver, their dominant effect is on that organ.] The HMG CoA reductase inhibitors also
decrease triglyceride levels and may increase HDL-C in some patients.
Figure 22.5 Inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA)
reductase by the statin drugs. LDL = low-density lipoprotein; VLDL = very–low-density
lipoprotein.
2.  Therapeutic uses
These drugs are used to lower the risk of ASCVD events for patients in the four statin benefit groups. Statins are
effective in lowering plasma cholesterol levels in all types of hyperlipidemias. However, patients who are
homozygous for familial hypercholesterolemia lack LDL receptors and, therefore, benefit much less from treatment
with these drugs.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
Lovastatin and simvastatin are lactones that are hydrolyzed to the active drug. The remaining statins are all
administered in their active form. Absorption of the statins is variable (30% to 85%) following oral administration.
All statins are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isoenzymes in the liver, except pravastatin. Excretion
takes place principally through bile and feces, but some urinary elimination also occurs. Some characteristics of the
statins are summarized in Figure 22.6.

Figure 22.6 Summary of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA)
reductase inhibitors. LDL = low-density lipoprotein; HDL = high-density lipoprotein.
4.  Adverse effects
Elevated liver enzymes may occur with statin therapy. Therefore, liver function should be evaluated prior to starting
therapy or if a patient has symptoms consistent with liver dysfunction. [Note: Hepatic insufficiency can cause drug
accumulation.] Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis (disintegration of skeletal muscle; rare) have been reported ( Figure
22.7). Risk factors for rhabdomyolysis, include renal insufficiency, vitamin D deficiency, hypothyroidism, advanced
age, female sex, and use of drugs that increase the risk of muscle adverse effects, such as azole antifungals, protease
inhibitors, cyclosporine, erythromycin, gemfibrozil , or niacin. Simvastatin is metabolized by CYP450 3A4, and
inhibitors of this enzyme may increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis. Plasma creatine kinase levels should be
determined in patients with muscle complaints. The HMG CoA reductase inhibitors may also increase the effect of
warfarin. Thus, it is important to evaluate the international normalized ratio (INR) when initiating a statin or
changing the dosage. These drugs are contraindicated during pregnancy, lactation, and active liver disease.

B.  Niacin (nicotinic acid)
Niacin [NYE-uh-sin] reduces LDL-C by 10% to 20% and is the most effective agent for increasing HDL-C. It also
lowers triglycerides by 20% to 35% at typical doses of 1.5 to 3 g/day. Niacin can be used in combination with
statins, and fixed-dose combinations of long-acting niacin with lovastatin and simvastatin are available. [Note: the
addition of niacin to statin therapy has not been shown to reduce the risk of ASCVD events.]
1.  Mechanism of action
At gram doses, niacin strongly inhibits lipolysis in adipose tissue, thereby reducing production of free fatty acids
(Figure 22.8). The liver normally uses circulating free fatty acids as a major precursor for triglyceride synthesis.
Reduced liver triglyceride levels decrease hepatic VLDL production, which in turn reduces LDL-C plasma
concentrations.
Figure 22.8 Niacin inhibits lipolysis in adipose tissue, resulting in decreased hepatic
very–low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis and production of low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) in the plasma.
2.  Therapeutic uses
Because niacin lowers plasma levels of both cholesterol and triglycerides, it is useful in the treatment of familial
838
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 839 ---

hyperlipidemias. It is also used to treat other severe hypercholesterolemias, often in combination with other agents.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
Niacin is administered orally. It is converted in the body to nicotinamide, which is incorporated into the cofactor
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). Niacin, its nicotinamide derivative, and other metabolites are excreted
in the urine. [Note: Administration of nicotinamide alone does not decrease plasma lipid levels.]
4.  Adverse effects
The most common adverse effects of niacin are an intense cutaneous flush accompanied by an uncomfortable
feeling of warmth and pruritus. Administration of aspirin prior to taking niacin decreases the flush, which is
prostaglandin-mediated. Some patients also experience nausea and abdominal pain. Slow titration of the dosage or
use of the sustained-release formulation of niacin reduces bothersome initial adverse effects. Niacin inhibits tubular
secretion of uric acid and, thus, predisposes patients to hyperuricemia and gout. Impaired glucose tolerance and
hepatotoxicity have also been reported. The drug should be avoided in active hepatic disease or in patients with an
active peptic ulcer.

C.  Fibrates
Fenofibrate [fen-oh-FIH-brate] and gemfibrozil  [jem-FI-broh-zill] are derivatives of fibric acid that lower serum
triglycerides and increase HDL-C.
1.  Mechanism of action
The peroxisome proliferator–activated receptors (PPARs) are members of the nuclear receptor family that regulate
lipid metabolism. PPARs function as ligand-activated transcription factors. Upon binding to their natural ligands
(fatty acids or eicosanoids) or antihyperlipidemic drugs, PPARs are activated. They then bind to peroxisome
proliferator response elements, which ultimately leads to decreased triglyceride concentrations through increased
expression of lipoprotein lipase (Figure 22.9) and decreased apolipoprotein (apo) CII concentration. Fenofibrate is
more effective than gemfibrozil  in lowering triglyceride levels. Fibrates also increase HDL-C by increasing the
expression of apo AI and apo AII.

lipoprotein; IDL = intermediate-density lipoprotein.
841
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 842 ---

2.  Therapeutic uses
The fibrates are used in the treatment of hypertriglyceridemias. They are particularly useful in treating type III
hyperlipidemia (dysbetalipoproteinemia), in which intermediate-density lipoprotein particles accumulate.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
Gemfibrozil  and fenofibrate are completely absorbed after oral administration and distribute widely, bound to
albumin. Fenofibrate is a prodrug, which is converted to the active moiety fenofibric acid. Both drugs undergo
extensive biotransformation and are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates.
4.  Adverse effects
The most common adverse effects are mild gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances. These lessen as the therapy
progresses. Because these drugs increase biliary cholesterol excretion, there is a predisposition to form gallstones.
Myositis (inflammation of a voluntary muscle) can occur, and muscle weakness or tenderness should be evaluated.
Patients with renal insufficiency may be at risk. Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients taking
gemfibrozil  and statins together. The use of gemfibrozil  is contraindicated with simvastatin, and, in general, the use
of gemfibrozil  with any statin should be avoided. Both fibrates may increase the effects of warfarin. Therefore, INR
should be monitored more frequently when a fibrate is initiated. Fibrates should not be used in patients with severe
hepatic or renal dysfunction, in patients with preexisting gallbladder disease or biliary cirrhosis.

--- PAGE 843 ---

D.  Bile acid sequestrants
Bile acid sequestrants (resins) have significant LDL-C lowering effects, although the benefits are less than those
observed with statins.
1.  Mechanism of action
Cholestyramine [koe-LES-tir-a-meen], colestipol  [koe-LES-tih-pole], and colesevelam [koh-le-SEV-e-lam] are
anion-exchange resins that bind negatively charged bile acids and bile salts in the small intestine (Figure 22.10). The
resin/bile acid complex is excreted in the feces, thus lowering the bile acid concentration. This causes hepatocytes to
increase conversion of cholesterol to bile acids, which are essential components of the bile. Consequently,
intracellular cholesterol concentrations decrease, which activates an increased hepatic uptake of cholesterol-
containing LDL-C particles, leading to a decrease in plasma LDL-C. [Note: This increased uptake is mediated by an
up-regulation of cell surface LDL receptors.]
843

--- PAGE 844 ---

Figure 22.10 Mechanism of bile acid sequestrants.
844
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 845 ---

2.  Therapeutic uses
The bile acid sequestrants are useful (often in combination with diet or niacin) for treating type IIA and type IIB
hyperlipidemias. [Note: In those rare individuals who are homozygous for type IIA and functional LDL receptors
are totally lacking, these drugs have little effect on plasma LDL levels.] Cholestyramine can also relieve pruritus
caused by accumulation of bile acids in patients with biliary stasis. Colesevelam is also indicated for type 2 diabetes
due to its glucose-lowering effects.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
Bile acid sequestrants are insoluble in water and have large molecular weights. After oral administration, they are
neither absorbed nor metabolically altered by the intestine. Instead, they are totally excreted in feces.
4.  Adverse effects
The most common adverse effects are GI disturbances, such as constipation, nausea, and flatulence. Colesevelam
has fewer GI side effects than other bile acid sequestrants. These agents may impair the absorption of the fat-soluble
vitamins (A, D, E, and K), and they interfere with the absorption of many drugs (for example, digoxin, warfarin, and
thyroid hormone). Therefore, other drugs should be taken at least 1 to 2 hours before, or 4 to 6 hours after, the bile
acid sequestrants. These agents may raise triglyceride levels and are contraindicated in patients with significant
hypertriglyceridemia (greater than 400 mg/dL).
845
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 846 ---

E.  Cholesterol absorption inhibitor
Ezetimibe [eh-ZEH-teh-mibe] selectively inhibits absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol in the small intestine,
leading to a decrease in the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver. This causes a reduction of hepatic
cholesterol stores and an increase in clearance of cholesterol from the blood. Ezetimibe lowers LDL-C by
approximately 18% to 23%. Due its modest LDL-C lowering, ezetimibe is often used as an adjunct to maximally
tolerated statin therapy in patients with high ASCVD risk, or in statin-intolerant patients. Ezetimibe is primarily
metabolized in the small intestine and liver via glucuronide conjugation, with subsequent biliary and renal excretion.
Patients with moderate to severe hepatic insufficiency should not be treated with ezetimibe. Adverse effects are
uncommon with the use of ezetimibe.

F.  Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 inhibitors
Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is an enzyme predominately produced in the liver. PCSK9
binds to the LDL receptor on the surface of hepatocytes, leading to the degradation of LDL receptors (Figure 22.11).
By inhibiting the PCSK9 enzyme, more LDL receptors are available to clear LDL-C from the serum. Alirocumab
[al-i-ROK-ue-mab] and evolocumab [e-voe-LOK-ue-mab] are PCSK9 inhibitors, which are fully humanized
monoclonal antibodies. These agents are used in addition to maximally tolerated statin therapy in patients with
heterozygous or homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or in patients with clinical ASCVD who require
additional LDL-C lowering. When combined with statin therapy, PCSK9 inhibitors provide potent LDL-C lowering
(50% to 70%). They may also be considered for patients with high ASCVD risk and statin intolerance. PCSK9
inhibitors are only available as subcutaneous injections and are administered every two to four weeks. Monoclonal
antibodies are not eliminated by the kidneys and have been used in dialysis patients or those with severe renal
impairment. PCSK9 inhibitors are generally well tolerated. The most common adverse drug reactions are injection
site reactions, immunologic or allergic reactions, nasopharyngitis, and upper respiratory tract infections.
Figure 22.11 Mechanism of action of PCSK9 inhibitors. PCSK9 binds to the LDL
receptor on the surface of hepatocytes, leading to degradation of LDL receptors.
Inhibition of PCSK9 prevents degradation of LDL receptors and promotes greater
clearance of LDL-C from the serum. LDL = low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; PCSK9
= proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9.

--- PAGE 848 ---

G.  Omega-3 fatty acids
Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are essential fatty acids that are predominately used for triglyceride
lowering. Essential fatty acids inhibit VLDL and triglyceride synthesis in the liver. The omega-3 PUFAs
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are found in marine sources such as tuna, halibut,
and salmon. Approximately 4 g of marine-derived omega-3 PUFAs daily decreases serum triglyceride
concentrations by 25% to 30%, with small increases in LDL-C and HDL-C. Over-the-counter or prescription fish oil
capsules (EPA/DHA) can be used for supplementation, as it is difficult to consume enough omega-3 PUFAs from
dietary sources alone. Icosapent  [eye-KOE-sa-pent] ethyl  is a prescription product that contains only EPA and,
unlike other fish oil supplements, does not significantly raise LDL-C. Omega-3 PUFAs can be considered as an
adjunct to other lipid-lowering therapies for individuals with elevated triglycerides (≥500 mg/dL). Although
effective for triglyceride lowering, omega-3 PUFA supplementation has not been shown to reduce cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality. The most common side effects of omega-3 PUFAs include GI effects (abdominal pain,
nausea, diarrhea) and a fishy aftertaste. Bleeding risk can be increased in those who are concomitantly taking
anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents.

H.  Combination drug therapy
It is sometimes necessary to use two antihyperlipidemic drugs to achieve treatment goals. Patients with established
ASCVD, an elevated 10-year risk of ASCVD, or those that do not achieve intended LDL-C reductions on maximally
tolerated statin therapy may be considered for combination therapy. Ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors can be
considered for add-on therapy, since there is evidence that these combinations further reduce ASCVD events in
patients already taking statin therapy. Combination drug therapy is not without risks. Liver and muscle toxicity
occur more frequently with lipid-lowering drug combinations. Figure 22.12 summarizes some actions of the
antihyperlipidemic drugs.

lipoprotein; HMG CoA = 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A; LDL = low-density
lipoprotein.

A.  Elevated blood pressure
B.  Gastrointestinal disturbance
C.  Neurologic problems
D.  Heart palpitations
Correct answer = B. Gastrointestinal disturbances frequently occur as an adverse effect of antihyperlipidemic
drug therapy. The other choices are not seen as often.
Which of the following hyperlipidemias is characterized by elevated plasma levels of chylomicrons and has
no drug therapy available to lower the plasma lipoprotein levels?
A.  Type I
B.  Type II
C.  Type III
D.  Type IV
Correct answer = A. Type I hyperlipidemia (hyperchylomicronemia) is treated with a low-fat diet. No drug
therapy is effective for this disorder.
Which of the following drugs decreases cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-
methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase?
A.  Fenofibrate
B.  Cholestyramine
C.  Lovastatin
D.  Gemfibrozil
Correct answer = C. Lovastatin decreases cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting HMG CoA reductase. Fenofibrate
and gemfibrozil increase the activity of lipoprotein lipase, thereby increasing the removal of VLDL from plasma.
Cholestyramine lowers the amount of bile acids returning to the liver via the enterohepatic circulation.
Which of the following nonstatin drugs lowers LDL-C most effectively?
A.  Niacin
B.  Alirocumab
C.  Cholestyramine
D.  Ezetimibe
Correct answer = B. Alirocumab is a PCSK9 inhibitor that can lower LDL-C by up to 70% in patients on statin
therapy. Niacin primarily raises HDL-C and decreases triglycerides, with less potent effects on LDL-C lowering.
Cholestyramine and ezetimibe both lower LDL-C, although not as potently as PCSK9 inhibitors.
Which of the following drugs binds bile acids in the intestine, thus preventing their return to the liver via the
enterohepatic circulation?
A.  Niacin
B.  Fenofibrate
C.  Cholestyramine
D.  Fluvastatin
Correct answer = C. Cholestyramine is an anion-exchange resin that binds negatively charged bile acids and bile
salts in the small intestine. The resin/bile acid complex is excreted in the feces, thus preventing the bile acids
from returning to the liver by the enterohepatic circulation. The other choices do not bind intestinal bile acids.
A 65-year-old man has type 2 diabetes mellitus and an LDL-C of 165 mg/dL. Which is the best option to
lower LDL-C and decrease the risk of ASCVD events in this patient?
A.  Fenofibrate
B.  Colesevelam
C.  Rosuvastatin
D.  Ezetimibe
Correct answer = C. Rosuvastatin, an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor (statin), is the most effective option for
lowering LDL-C, achieving reductions of up to 60% from baseline levels. Statins are the primary modality for
reducing ASCVD risk when drug therapy is indicated. Fenofibrate is more effective at lowering triglyceride
levels or raising HDL-C. Colesevelam can reduce LDL-C, but not as effectively as statins. Ezetimibe lowers
LDL-C modestly compared to the LDL-C reduction achieved by statins.850

22.10A 62-year-old female with hyperlipidemia and hypothyroidism is prescribed cholestyramine and
levothyroxine (thyroid hormone). What advice would you give this patient to avoid a drug interaction
between her cholestyramine and levothyroxine?
A.  Stop taking the levothyroxine as it can interact with cholestyramine.
B.  Take levothyroxine 1 hour before cholestyramine on an empty stomach.
C.  Switch cholestyramine to colesevelam as this eliminates the interaction.
D.  Switch cholestyramine to colestipol as this eliminates the interaction.
Correct answer = B. Cholestyramine and the bile acid sequestrants can bind several medications, causing
decreased absorption of medications such as levothyroxine. Administration of levothyroxine 1 hour before or 4 to
6 hours after cholestyramine can help to avoid this interaction. Choices C and D are incorrect, as all bile acid
sequestrants cause this interaction. Choice A is incorrect, as this patient should not stop her thyroid medication.
A 42-year-old man was started on sustained-release niacin 2 weeks ago. He reports uncomfortable flushing
and itchiness that he thinks is related to the niacin. Which of the following can help manage this adverse
effect of niacin therapy?
A.  Administer aspirin 30 minutes prior to taking niacin.
B.  Administer aspirin 30 minutes after taking niacin.
C.  Increase the dose of niacin.
D.  Change the sustained-release niacin to immediate-release niacin.
Correct answer = A. Flushing associated with niacin is prostaglandin mediated; therefore, use of aspirin (a
prostaglandin inhibitor) can help to minimize this adverse effect. It must be administered 30 minutes before the
dose of the niacin; therefore, choice B is incorrect. Increasing the dose of niacin is likely to increase these
complaints; therefore, choice C is incorrect. The sustained-release formulation of niacin has less incidence of
flushing versus that of the immediate release; therefore, choice D is incorrect.
A 72-year-old man with hyperlipidemia and renal insufficiency has been treated with high-intensity
atorvastatin for 6 months. His LDL-C is 131 mg/dL; triglycerides, 710 mg/dL; and HDL-C, 32 mg/dL. His
physician wishes to add another agent for hyperlipidemia. Which is the best option to address the
hyperlipidemia in this patient?
A.  Fenofibrate
B.  Niacin
C.  Colestipol
D.  Gemfibrozil
Correct answer = B. This patient has significantly elevated triglycerides and low HDL-C. Niacin can lower
triglycerides by 35% to 50% and also raise HDL-C. The fibrates (fenofibrate and gemfibrozil) should not be used
due to the history of renal insufficiency. In addition, the use of gemfibrozil with statins should be avoided.
Colestipol should not be used because triglycerides are greater than 400 mg/dL.
Which patient population is most likely to experience myalgia (muscle pain) or myopathy with use of HMG
CoA reductase inhibitors?
A.  Patients with renal insufficiency
B.  Patients with gout
C.  Patients with hypertriglyceridemia
D.  Patients taking warfarin (blood thinner)
Correct answer = A. Patients with a history of renal insufficiency have a higher incidence of developing myalgias,
myopathy, and rhabdomyolysis with use of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), especially with those that are
renally eliminated as drug accumulation can occur. The other populations have not been reported to have a higher
incidence of this adverse effect with HMG CoA reductase inhibitors.851

I.  Overview
The endocrine system releases hormones into the bloodstream, which carries chemical messengers to target cells
throughout the body. Hormones have a much broader range of response time than do nerve impulses, requiring from
seconds to days, or longer, to cause a response that may last for weeks or months. [Note: Nerve impulses generally
act within milliseconds.] An important function of the hypothalamus is to connect the nervous system with the
endocrine system via the pituitary gland. This chapter presents the central role of hypothalamic and pituitary
hormones in regulating body functions. In addition, drugs affecting thyroid hormone synthesis and/or secretion are
discussed (Figure 23.1). Chapters 24 to 26 focus on drugs that affect the synthesis and/or secretion of specific
hormones and their actions.

--- PAGE 856 ---

II.  Hypothalamic and Anterior Pituitary Hormones
The hormones secreted by the hypothalamus and the pituitary are peptides or glycoproteins that act by binding to
specific receptor sites on target tissues. The hormones of the anterior pituitary are regulated by neuropeptides that
are called either “releasing” or “inhibiting” factors or hormones. These are produced in the hypothalamus, and they
reach the pituitary by the hypophyseal portal system (Figure 23.2). The interaction of the releasing hormones with
receptors results in the activation of genes that promote the synthesis of protein precursors. The protein precursors
then undergo posttranslational modification to produce hormones, which are released into the circulation. Each
hypothalamic regulatory hormone controls the release of a specific hormone from the anterior pituitary. Pituitary
hormone preparations are currently used for specific hormonal deficiencies, although most of the agents have
limited therapeutic applications. Hormones of the anterior pituitary are administered intramuscularly (IM),
subcutaneously, or intranasally because their peptidyl nature makes them susceptible to destruction by proteolytic
enzymes of the digestive tract.

thyroid-stimulating hormone; FSH = follicle-stimulating hormone; LH = luteinizing
hormone.

--- PAGE 857 ---

A.  Adrenocorticotropic hormone (corticotropin)
Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is responsible for the synthesis and release of the peptide
proopiomelanocortin by the pituitary (Figure 23.3). Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or corticotropin [kor-ti-
koe-TROE-pin] is a product of the posttranslational processing of this precursor polypeptide. [Note: CRH is used
diagnostically to differentiate between Cushing syndrome and ectopic ACTH-producing cells.] Normally, ACTH is
released from the pituitary in pulses with an overriding diurnal rhythm, with the highest concentration occurring in
early morning and the lowest in late evening. Stress stimulates its secretion, whereas cortisol acting via negative
feedback suppresses its release.

--- PAGE 859 ---

Figure 23.3 Secretion and actions of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). CRH =
corticotropin-releasing hormone.
1.  Mechanism of action
ACTH binds to receptors on the surface of the adrenal cortex, thereby activating G protein–coupled processes that
ultimately stimulate the rate-limiting step in the adrenocorticosteroid synthetic pathway (cholesterol to
pregnenolone; Figure 23.3). This pathway ends with the synthesis and release of adrenocorticosteroids and the
adrenal androgens.
2.  Therapeutic uses
The availability of synthetic adrenocorticosteroids with specific properties has limited the use of corticotropin
mainly to serving as a diagnostic tool for differentiating between primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease,
associated with adrenal atrophy) and secondary adrenal insufficiency (caused by inadequate secretion of ACTH by
the pituitary). Therapeutic corticotropin preparations are extracts from the anterior pituitaries of domestic animals or
synthetic human ACTH. The latter, cosyntropin [ko-sin-TROE-pin], is preferred for the diagnosis of adrenal
insufficiency. ACTH is also used in the treatment of infantile spasms and multiple sclerosis.
3.  Adverse effects
Short-term use of ACTH for diagnostic purposes is usually well tolerated. With longer use, toxicities are similar to
glucocorticoids and include hypertension, peripheral edema, hypokalemia, emotional disturbances, and increased
risk of infection.

B.  Growth hormone (somatotropin)
Somatotropin is released by the anterior pituitary in response to growth hormone (GH)-releasing hormone (Figure
23.4). Conversely, secretion of GH is inhibited by the hormone somatostatin (see below). GH is released in a
pulsatile manner, with the highest levels occurring during sleep. With increasing age, GH secretion decreases,
accompanied by a decrease in lean muscle mass. Somatotropin influences a wide variety of biochemical processes
(for example, cell proliferation and bone growth). Synthetic human GH (somatropin [soe-mah-TROE-pin]) is
produced using recombinant DNA technology.

hormone.

Although many physiologic effects of GH are exerted directly at its targets, others are mediated through the
somatomedins—insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2 (IGF-1 and IGF-2). [Note: In acromegaly (a syndrome of excess
GH due to hormone-secreting tumors), IGF-1 levels are consistently high, reflecting elevated GH.]
2.  Therapeutic uses
Somatropin is used in the treatment of GH deficiency, growth failure in children, treatment of HIV patients with
cachexia, and GH replacement in adults with confirmed deficiency. [Note: GH administered to adults increases lean
body mass, bone density, and skin thickness, and decreases adipose tissue. Many consider GH an “antiaging”
hormone. This has led to off-label use of GH by older individuals and by athletes seeking to enhance performance.]
Somatropin is administered by subcutaneous or IM injection. Although the half-life of GH is short (approximately
25 minutes), it induces release of IGF-1 from the liver, which is responsible for subsequent GH-like actions.
3.  Adverse effects
Adverse effects of somatropin include pain at the injection site, edema, arthralgias, myalgias, nausea, and an
increased risk of diabetes. Somatropin should not be used in pediatric patients with closed epiphyses, patients with860

C.  Somatostatin (growth hormone–inhibiting hormone)
In the pituitary, somatostatin binds to receptors that suppress GH and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) release.
Originally isolated from the hypothalamus, somatostatin is a small polypeptide found in neurons throughout the
body as well as in the intestine, stomach, and pancreas. Somatostatin not only inhibits release of GH but also insulin,
glucagon, and gastrin. Octreotide [ok-TREE-oh-tide] and lanreotide [lan-REE-oh-tide] are synthetic analogs of
somatostatin with longer half-lives. Depot formulations of these agents allow for administration every 4 weeks.
They have found use in the treatment of acromegaly and in severe diarrhea/flushing episodes associated with
carcinoid tumors. An intravenous infusion of octreotide is also used for the treatment of bleeding esophageal
varices. Adverse effects of octreotide include bradycardia, diarrhea, abdominal pain, flatulence, nausea, and
steatorrhea. Gallbladder emptying is delayed, and asymptomatic cholesterol gallstones can occur with long-term
treatment.

D.  Gonadotropin-releasing hormone
Pulsatile secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus is essential for release of the
gonadotropins follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary.
However, continuous administration of GnRH inhibits gonadotropin release through down-regulation of GnRH
receptors on the pituitary. Continuous administration of synthetic GnRH analogs, such as leuprolide [loo-PROE-
lide], is effective in suppressing production of FSH and LH (Figure 23.5). Suppression of gonadotropins, in turn,
leads to reduced production of gonadal steroid hormones (androgens and estrogens). Thus, these agents are effective
in the treatment of prostate cancer, endometriosis, and precocious puberty. Leuprolide is also used to suppress the
LH surge and prevent premature ovulation in women undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation protocols for the
treatment of infertility. [Note: GnRH antagonists such as cetrorelix (set-roe-REL-iks) and ganirelix (ga-ni-REL-iks)
can also be used to inhibit LH secretion in infertility protocols.] In women, the GnRH analogs may cause hot flushes
and sweating, as well as diminished libido, depression, and ovarian cysts. They are contraindicated in pregnancy and
breast-feeding. In men, they initially cause a rise in testosterone that can result in bone pain. Hot flushes, edema,
gynecomastia, and diminished libido may also occur.

(LH). GnRH = gonadotropin-releasing hormone.

--- PAGE 864 ---

E.  Gonadotropins
The gonadotropins (FSH and LH) are produced in the anterior pituitary. The regulation of gonadal steroid hormones
depends on these agents. They find use in the treatment of infertility. Menotropins [men-oh-TROE-pinz] (also
known as human menopausal gonadotropins or hMG) are obtained from urine of postmenopausal women and
contain both FSH and LH. Urofollitropin [yoor-oh-fol-li-TROE-pin] is FSH obtained from postmenopausal women
and is devoid of LH. Follitropin [fol-ih-TROE-pin] alfa and follitropin beta are human FSH products manufactured
using recombinant DNA technology. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a placental hormone that is excreted
in urine of pregnant women. The effects of hCG and choriogonadotropin [kore-ee-oh-goe-NAD-oh-troe-pin] alfa
(made using recombinant DNA technology) are essentially identical to those of LH. All of these hormones are
injected via the IM or subcutaneous route. Injection of hMG or FSH products over a period of 5 to 12 days causes
ovarian follicular growth and maturation, and with subsequent injection of hCG, ovulation occurs. Adverse effects
include ovarian enlargement and possible ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, which may be life threatening.
Multiple births can occur.

F.  Prolactin
Prolactin is a peptide hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary. Its primary function is to stimulate and maintain
lactation. In addition, it decreases sexual drive and reproductive function. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulates
the release of prolactin, and secretion is inhibited by dopamine acting at D2 receptors (Figure 23.6). [Note: Drugs
that act as dopamine antagonists (for example, metoclopramide and some antipsychotics) can increase the secretion
of prolactin.] Hyperprolactinemia, which is associated with galactorrhea and hypogonadism, is treated with D2
receptor agonists, such as bromocriptine and cabergoline. Both of these agents also find use in the treatment of
pituitary microadenomas. Bromocriptine is also indicated for treatment of type 2 diabetes. Among their adverse
effects are nausea, headache and, less frequently, psychosis.

releasing hormone.

III.  Hormones of the Posterior Pituitary
In contrast to the hormones of the anterior lobe of the pituitary, those of the posterior lobe, vasopressin and oxytocin,
are not regulated by releasing hormones. Instead, they are synthesized in the hypothalamus, transported to the
posterior pituitary, and released in response to specific physiologic signals, such as high plasma osmolarity or
parturition. Both hormones are administered intravenously and have very short half-lives. Their actions are
summarized in Figure 23.7.

A.  Oxytocin
Oxytocin [ok-se-TOE-sin] is used in obstetrics to stimulate uterine contraction and induce labor. Oxytocin also
causes milk ejection by contracting the myoepithelial cells around the mammary alveoli. Although toxicities are
uncommon with proper drug use, hypertension, uterine rupture, water retention, and fetal death may occur. Its
antidiuretic and pressor activities are much less than those of vasopressin.
869
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 870 ---

B.  Vasopressin
Vasopressin [vas-oh-PRESS-in] (antidiuretic hormone) is structurally related to oxytocin. Vasopressin has both
antidiuretic and vasopressor effects (Figure 23.7). In the kidney, it binds to the V2 receptor to increase water
permeability and reabsorption in the collecting tubules. Thus, the major use of vasopressin is to treat diabetes
insipidus. It also finds use in septic shock and in controlling bleeding due to esophageal varices. Other effects of
vasopressin are mediated by the V1 receptor, which is found in the liver, vascular smooth muscle (where it causes
constriction), and other tissues. The major toxicities of vasopressin are water intoxication and hyponatremia.
Abdominal pain, tremor, and vertigo can also occur. Desmopressin [des-moe-PRESS-in], an analog of vasopressin,
has minimal activity at the V1 receptor, making it largely free of pressor effects. This analog is longer acting than
vasopressin and is preferred for the treatment of diabetes insipidus and nocturnal enuresis. For these indications,
desmopressin is administered intranasally or orally. [Note: The nasal spray should not be used for enuresis due to
reports of seizures in children using this formulation.] Local irritation may occur with the nasal spray.

IV.  Thyroid Hormones
The thyroid gland facilitates normal growth and maturation by maintaining a level of metabolism in the tissues that
is optimal for normal function. The two major thyroid hormones are triiodothyronine (T3; the most active form) and
thyroxine (T4). Inadequate secretion of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) results in bradycardia, cold intolerance,
and mental and physical slowing. In children, this can cause mental retardation and dwarfism. By contrast, excess
secretion of thyroid hormones (hyperthyroidism) can cause tachycardia and cardiac arrhythmias, body wasting,
nervousness, tremor, and heat intolerance.
871
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 872 ---

A.  Thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion
The thyroid gland is made up of multiple follicles that consist of a single layer of epithelial cells surrounding a
lumen filled with thyroglobulin (the storage form of thyroid hormone). Thyroid function is controlled by TSH
(thyrotropin), which is synthesized by the anterior pituitary (Figure 23.8). [Note: The hypothalamic thyrotropin-
releasing hormone (TRH) governs the generation of TSH.] TSH action is mediated by cAMP and leads to
stimulation of iodide (I−) uptake by the thyroid gland. Oxidation to iodine (I2) by a peroxidase is followed by
iodination of tyrosines on thyroglobulin. [Note: Antibodies to thyroid peroxidase are diagnostic for Hashimoto
thyroiditis, a common cause of hypothyroidism.] Condensation of two diiodotyrosine residues gives rise to T4,
whereas condensation of a monoiodotyrosine residue with a diiodotyrosine residue generates T3. The hormones are
released following proteolytic cleavage of the thyroglobulin. A summary of the steps in thyroid hormone synthesis
and secretion is shown in Figure 23.9.

873
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 874 ---

B.  Mechanism of action
Most circulating T3 and T4 is bound to thyroxine-binding globulin in the plasma. The hormones must dissociate
from thyroxine-binding globulin prior to entry into cells. In the cell, T4 is enzymatically deiodinated to T3, which
enters the nucleus and attaches to specific receptors. The activation of these receptors promotes the formation of
RNA and subsequent protein synthesis, which is responsible for the effects of T4.
874
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 875 ---

C.  Pharmacokinetics
Both T4 and T3 are absorbed after oral administration. Food, calcium preparations, iron salts, and aluminum-
containing antacids can decrease the absorption of T4. Deiodination is the major route of metabolism of T4. T3 also
undergoes sequential deiodination. The hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and
sulfates and excreted into bile.
875
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 876 ---

D.  Treatment of hypothyroidism
Hypothyroidism usually results from autoimmune destruction of the gland and is diagnosed by elevated TSH.
Levothyroxine (T4) [leh-vo-thye-ROK-sin] is preferred over T3 (liothyronine [lye-oh-THYE-roe-neen]) or T3/T4
combination products (liotrix [LYE-oh-trix]) for the treatment of hypothyroidism. Levothyroxine is better tolerated
than T3 preparations and has a longer half-life. It is dosed once daily, and steady state is achieved in 6 to 8 weeks.
Toxicity is directly related to T4 levels and manifests as nervousness, palpitations and tachycardia, heat intolerance,
and unexplained weight loss. Drugs that induce the cytochrome P-450 enzymes, such as phenytoin, rifampin, and
phenobarbital , accelerate metabolism of thyroid hormones and may decrease the effectiveness (Figure 23.10).

= triiodothyronine; T4 = thyroxine.

--- PAGE 877 ---

E.  Treatment of hyperthyroidism (thyrotoxicosis)
Graves disease, an autoimmune disease that affects the thyroid, is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. In
these situations, TSH levels are low due to negative feedback. [Note: Feedback inhibition of TRH occurs with high
levels of circulating thyroid hormone, which, in turn, decreases secretion of TSH.] The goal of therapy is to decrease
synthesis and/or release of additional hormone. This can be accomplished by removing part or all of the thyroid
gland, by inhibiting synthesis of the hormones, or by blocking release of hormones from the follicle.
1.  Removal of the thyroid
This can be accomplished surgically or by destruction of the gland with radioactive iodine (131I), which is
selectively taken up by the thyroid follicular cells. Most patients become hypothyroid after radioactive iodine and
require treatment with levothyroxine.
2.  Inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis
The thioamides, propylthiouracil  [proe-pil-thye-oh-YOOR-ah-sil] (PTU) and methimazole [me-THIM-ah-zole], are
concentrated in the thyroid, where they inhibit both the oxidative processes required for iodination of tyrosyl groups
and the condensation (coupling) of iodotyrosines to form T3 and T4 (Figure 23.9). PTU also blocks the peripheral
conversion of T4 to T3. [Note: These drugs have no effect on thyroglobulin already stored in the gland. Therefore,
clinical effects may be delayed until thyroglobulin stores are depleted (Figure 23.11).] Methimazole is preferred over
PTU because it has a longer half-life, allowing for once-daily dosing, and a lower incidence of adverse effects.
However, PTU is recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy due to a greater risk of teratogenic effects
with methimazole. PTU has been associated with hepatotoxicity and, rarely, agranulocytosis.
Figure 23.11 Time required for patients with Graves hyperthyroidism to become
euthyroid with normal serum T4 and T3 concentrations.
3.  Blockade of hormone release
A pharmacologic dose of iodide inhibits the iodination of tyrosines (“Wolff-Chaikoff effect”), but this effect lasts
only a few days. More importantly, iodide inhibits the release of thyroid hormones from thyroglobulin by
mechanisms not yet understood. Iodide is employed to treat thyroid storm or prior to surgery, because it decreases
the vascularity of the thyroid gland. Iodide, administered orally, is not useful for long-term therapy; the thyroid
ceases to respond to the drug after a few weeks. Adverse effects include sore mouth and throat, swelling of the
tongue or larynx, rashes, ulcerations of mucous membranes, and metallic taste.
4.  Thyroid storm
Thyroid storm presents with extreme symptoms of hyperthyroidism. The treatment of thyroid storm is the same as
for hyperthyroidism, except that the drugs are given in higher doses and more frequently. β-Blockers, such as
metoprolol  or propranolol , are effective in blunting the widespread sympathetic stimulation that occurs in
hyperthyroidism.

I.  Overview
The pancreas produces the peptide hormones insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin. The peptide hormones are
secreted from cells in the islets of Langerhans (β-cells produce insulin, α cells produce glucagon, and δ cells produce
somatostatin). These hormones play an important role in regulating metabolic activities of the body, particularly
glucose homeostasis. A relative or absolute lack of insulin, as seen in diabetes mellitus, can cause serious
hyperglycemia. Left untreated, retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and cardiovascular complications may result.
Administration of insulin preparations or other glucose-lowering agents (Figure 24.1) can reduce morbidity and
mortality associated with diabetes.

II.  Diabetes Mellitus
The incidence of diabetes is growing rapidly in the United States and worldwide. An estimated 30.3 million people
in the United States and 422 million people worldwide are afflicted with diabetes. Diabetes is not a single disease.
Rather, it is a heterogeneous group of syndromes characterized by elevated blood glucose attributed to a relative or
absolute deficiency of insulin. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recognizes four clinical classifications of
diabetes: type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes, and diabetes due to other causes such as genetic
defects or medications. Figure 24.2 summarizes the characteristics of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Gestational
diabetes is defined as carbohydrate intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy.
Figure 24.2 Comparison of type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
885
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 886 ---

A.  Type 1 diabetes
Type 1 diabetes most commonly afflicts children, adolescents, or young adults, but some latent forms occur later in
life. The disease is characterized by an absolute deficiency of insulin due to destruction of β cells. Without
functional β cells, the pancreas fails to respond to glucose, and a person with type 1 diabetes shows classic
symptoms of insulin deficiency (polydipsia, polyphagia, polyuria, and weight loss).
1.  Cause
Loss of β-cell function in type 1 diabetes results from autoimmune-mediated processes that may be triggered by
viruses or other environmental toxins. In patients without diabetes, constant β-cell secretion maintains low basal
levels of circulating insulin. This suppresses lipolysis, proteolysis, and glycogenolysis. A burst of insulin secretion
occurs within 2 minutes after ingesting a meal, in response to transient increases in circulating glucose and amino
acids. This lasts for up to 15 minutes, followed by the postprandial secretion of insulin. However, without functional
β cells, those with type 1 diabetes can neither maintain basal secretion of insulin nor respond to variations in
circulating glucose (Figure 24.3).
Figure 24.3 Release of insulin that occurs in response to an IV glucose load in normal
subjects and diabetic patients.
2.  Treatment
A person with type 1 diabetes must rely on exogenous insulin to control hyperglycemia, avoid ketoacidosis, and
maintain acceptable levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). [Note: HbA1c is a marker of overall glucose control
and is used to monitor diabetes in clinical practice. The rate of formation of HbA1c is proportional to the average
blood glucose concentration over the previous 3 months. A higher average glucose results in a higher HbA1c.] The
goal of insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes is to maintain blood glucose as close to normal as possible and to avoid
wide fluctuations in glucose. The use of home blood glucose monitors facilitates frequent self-monitoring and
treatment with insulin.

B.  Type 2 diabetes
Type 2 diabetes accounts for greater than 90% of cases. Type 2 diabetes is influenced by genetic factors, aging,
obesity, and peripheral insulin resistance, rather than autoimmune processes. The metabolic alterations are generally
milder than those observed with type 1 diabetes (for example, patients with type 2 diabetes typically are not ketotic),
but the long-term clinical consequences are similar.
1.  Cause
Type 2 diabetes is characterized by a lack of sensitivity of target organs to insulin ( Figure 24.4). In type 2 diabetes,
the pancreas retains some β-cell function, but insulin secretion is insufficient to maintain glucose homeostasis
(Figure 24.3) in the face of increasing peripheral insulin resistance. The β-cell mass may gradually decline over time
in type 2 diabetes. In contrast to patients with type 1 diabetes, those with type 2 diabetes are often obese. Obesity
contributes to insulin resistance, which is considered the major underlying defect of type 2 diabetes.
Figure 24.4 Major factors contributing to hyperglycemia observed in type 2 diabetes.
888
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 889 ---

2.  Treatment
The goal in treating type 2 diabetes is to maintain blood glucose within normal limits and to prevent the
development of long-term complications. Weight reduction, exercise, and dietary modification decrease insulin
resistance and correct hyperglycemia in some patients with type 2 diabetes. However, most patients require
pharmacologic intervention with oral glucose-lowering agents. As the disease progresses, β-cell function declines,
and insulin therapy is often needed to achieve satisfactory glucose levels (Figure 24.5).

recommended sequence of therapy.

--- PAGE 890 ---

III.  Insulin and Insulin Analogs
Insulin [IN-su-lin] is a polypeptide hormone consisting of two peptide chains that are connected by disulfide bonds.
It is synthesized as a precursor (proinsulin) that undergoes proteolytic cleavage to form insulin and C-peptide, both
of which are secreted by the β cells of the pancreas. [Note: Because insulin undergoes significant hepatic and renal
extraction, plasma insulin levels may not accurately reflect insulin production. Thus, measurement of C-peptide
provides a better index of insulin levels.] Insulin secretion is regulated by blood glucose levels, certain amino acids,
other hormones, and autonomic mediators. Secretion is most often triggered by increased blood glucose, which is
taken up by the glucose transporter into the β cells of the pancreas. There, it is phosphorylated by glucokinase,
which acts as a glucose sensor. The products of glucose metabolism enter the mitochondrial respiratory chain and
generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The rise in ATP levels causes a blockade of K+ channels, leading to
membrane depolarization and an influx of Ca2+. The increase in intracellular Ca2+ causes pulsatile insulin
exocytosis.

--- PAGE 891 ---

A.  Mechanism of action
Exogenous insulin is administered to replace absent insulin secretion in type 1 diabetes or to supplement insufficient
insulin secretion in type 2 diabetes.
891
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 892 ---

B.  Pharmacokinetics
Human insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology using strains of Escherichia coli or yeast that are
genetically altered to contain the gene for human insulin. Modification of the amino acid sequence of human insulin
produces insulins with different pharmacokinetic properties. Insulin preparations vary primarily in their onset and
duration of activity. Dose, injection site, blood supply, temperature, and physical activity can also affect the onset
and duration of various insulin preparations. Because insulin is a polypeptide, it is degraded in the gastrointestinal
tract if taken orally. Therefore, it is generally administered by subcutaneous injection, although an inhaled insulin
formulation is also available. [Note: In a hyperglycemic emergency, regular insulin is administered intravenously
(IV).] Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (also called the insulin pump) is another method of insulin delivery.
This method of administration may be more convenient for some patients, eliminating multiple daily injections of
insulin. The pump is programmed to deliver a basal rate of insulin. In addition, it allows the patient to deliver a
bolus of insulin to cover mealtime carbohydrate intake and compensate for high blood glucose.

C.  Adverse effects
Hypoglycemia is the most serious and common adverse reaction to insulin ( Figure 24.6). Other adverse effects
include weight gain, local injection site reactions, and lipodystrophy. Lipodystrophy can be minimized by rotation of
injection sites. Diabetics with renal insufficiency may require a decrease in insulin dose. Due to the potential for
bronchospasm with inhaled insulin, patients with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and smokers

IV.  Insulin Preparations and Treatment
Insulin preparations are classified as rapid-, short-, intermediate-, or long-acting. Figure 24.7 summarizes onset of
action, timing of peak level, and duration of action for the various types of insulin. It is important that clinicians
exercise caution when adjusting insulin treatment, paying strict attention to the dose and type of insulin.

A.  Rapid-acting and short-acting insulin preparations
Five preparations fall into this category: regular insulin, insulin lispro [LIS-proe], insulin aspart  [AS-part], insulin
glulisine [gloo-LYSE-een], and inhaled insulin. Regular insulin is a short-acting, soluble, crystalline zinc insulin.
Insulin lispro, aspart , and glulisine are classified as rapid-acting insulins. Modification of the amino acid sequence
of regular insulin produces analogs that are rapid-acting insulins. This modification results in more rapid absorption,
a quicker onset, and a shorter duration of action after subcutaneous injection. Peak levels of insulin lispro are seen at
30 to 90 minutes, as compared with 50 to 120 minutes for regular insulin. Insulin aspart  and insulin glulisine have
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties similar to those of insulin lispro. Inhaled insulin is also
considered rapid-acting. This dry powder formulation is inhaled and absorbed through pulmonary tissue, with peak
levels achieved within 45 to 60 minutes. Rapid- or short-acting insulins are administered to mimic the prandial
(mealtime) release of insulins and to control postprandial glucose. They may also be used in cases where swift
correction of elevated glucose is needed. Rapid- and short-acting insulins are usually used in conjunction with a
longer-acting basal insulin that provides control of fasting glucose. Regular insulin should be injected
subcutaneously 30 minutes before a meal, whereas rapid-acting insulins are administered in the 15 minutes
preceding a meal or within 15 to 20 minutes after starting a meal. Rapid-acting insulin suspensions are commonly
used in external insulin pumps, and they are suitable for IV administration, although regular insulin is most
commonly used when the IV route is needed.

--- PAGE 898 ---

B.  Intermediate-acting insulin
Neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin is an intermediate-acting insulin formed by the addition of zinc and
protamine to regular insulin. [Note: Another name for this preparation is insulin isophane.] The combination with
protamine forms a complex that is less soluble, resulting in delayed absorption and a longer duration of action. NPH
insulin is used for basal (fasting) control in type 1 or 2 diabetes and is usually given along with rapid- or short-acting
insulin for mealtime control. NPH insulin should be given only subcutaneously (never IV ), and it should not be used
when rapid glucose lowering is needed (for example, diabetic ketoacidosis). Figure 24.8 shows common regimens
that use combinations of insulins.

--- PAGE 901 ---

C.  Long-acting insulin preparations
The isoelectric point of insulin glargine [GLAR-geen] is lower than that of human insulin, leading to formation of a
precipitate at the injection site that releases insulin over an extended period. It has a slower onset than NPH insulin
and a flat, prolonged hypoglycemic effect with no peak ( Figure 24.7). Insulin detemir [deh-TEE-meer] has a fatty
acid side chain that enhances association to albumin. Slow dissociation from albumin results in long-acting
properties similar to those of insulin glargine. Insulin degludec [de-GLOO-dek] remains in solution at physiologic
pH, with a slow release over an extended period. It has the longest half-life of the long-acting insulins. As with NPH
insulin, insulin glargine, insulin detemir, and insulin degludec are used for basal control and should only be
administered subcutaneously. Long-acting insulins should not be mixed in the same syringe with other insulins,
because doing so may alter the pharmacodynamic profile.
901

--- PAGE 902 ---

D.  Insulin combinations
Various premixed combinations of human insulins, such as 70% NPH insulin plus 30% regular insulin (Figure 24.8)
or 50% of each of these, are also available. Use of premixed combinations decreases the number of daily injections
but makes it more difficult to adjust individual components of the insulin regimen.
902

--- PAGE 903 ---

E.  Standard treatment versus intensive treatment
Standard insulin therapy involves twice daily injections. In contrast, intensive treatment utilizes three or more
injections daily with frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels. The ADA recommends a target mean blood
glucose level of 154 mg/dL or less (HbA1c ≤ 7%) for most patients, and intensive treatment is more likely to achieve
this goal. The frequency of hypoglycemic episodes, coma, and seizures is higher with intensive insulin regimens
(Figure 24.9A). However, patients on intensive therapy show a significant reduction in microvascular complications
of diabetes such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy compared to patients receiving standard care ( Figure
24.9B ). Intensive therapy should not be recommended for patients with long-standing diabetes, significant
microvascular complications, advanced age, and those with hypoglycemic unawareness.

of patients with type 1 diabetes receiving intensive or standard therapy. B. Effect of
standard and intensive care on the long-term complications of diabetes.

V.  Synthetic Amylin Analog
Amylin is a hormone that is cosecreted with insulin from β cells following food intake. It delays gastric emptying,
decreases postprandial glucagon secretion, and improves satiety. Pramlintide [PRAM-lin-tide] is a synthetic amylin
analog that is indicated as an adjunct to mealtime insulin therapy in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
Pramlintide is administered by subcutaneous injection immediately before meals. When pramlintide is initiated, the
dose of mealtime insulin should be decreased by 50% to avoid a risk of severe hypoglycemia. Other adverse effects
include nausea, anorexia, and vomiting. Pramlintide may not be mixed in the same syringe with insulin, and it
should be avoided in patients with diabetic gastroparesis (delayed stomach emptying), cresol hypersensitivity, or
hypoglycemic unawareness.

--- PAGE 905 ---

VI.  Glucagon-like Peptide Receptor Agonists
Oral intake of glucose results in a higher secretion of insulin than occurs when an equal load of glucose is given IV.
This effect is referred to as the “incretin effect” and is markedly reduced in type 2 diabetes. The incretin effect
occurs because the gut releases incretin hormones, notably glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent
insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), in response to a meal. Incretin hormones are responsible for 60% to 70% of
postprandial insulin secretion. Albiglutide [al-bi-GLOO-tide], dulaglutide [doo-la-GLOO-tide], exenatide [EX-e-
nah-tide], liraglutide [LIR-a-GLOO-tide], lixisenatide [lix-i-SEN-a-tide], and semaglutide [sem-a-GLOO-tide] are
injectable GLP-1 receptor agonists used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Liraglutide is also approved to reduce
the risk of cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular
disease. Two premixed preparations of long-acting insulins and GLP-1 receptor agonists are available: insulin
glargine plus lixisenatide and insulin degludec plus liraglutide. Use of these combinations may decrease daily
insulin requirements and the number of daily injections.
905
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 906 ---

A.  Mechanism of action
These agents are analogs of GLP-1 that exert their activity by improving glucose-dependent insulin secretion,
slowing gastric emptying time, reducing food intake by enhancing satiety (a feeling of fullness), decreasing
postprandial glucagon secretion, and promoting β-cell proliferation. Consequently, postprandial hyperglycemia is
reduced, HbA1c levels decline, and weight loss may occur.
906
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 907 ---

B.  Pharmacokinetics
GLP-1 receptor agonists are administered subcutaneously, since they are polypeptides. Albiglutide, dulaglutide,
liraglutide, and semaglutide are considered long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists. Albiglutide, dulaglutide, and
semaglutide are dosed once weekly, while liraglutide is available as a once-daily injection. Lixisenatide is a short-
acting GLP-1 receptor agonist that is dosed once daily. Exenatide is available as both a short-acting (dosed twice
daily) and extended-release preparation (dosed once weekly). Exenatide should be avoided in patients with severe
renal impairment.
907

--- PAGE 908 ---

C.  Adverse effects
The main adverse effects of the incretin mimetics consist of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation. GLP-1
receptor agonists have been associated with pancreatitis and should be avoided in patients with chronic pancreatitis.
Longer-acting agents have been associated with thyroid C-cell tumors in rodents. It is unknown if GLP-1 receptor
agonists cause these tumors or thyroid carcinoma in humans, although they are contraindicated in patients with a
history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2.

--- PAGE 909 ---

VII.  Oral Agents
Oral agents are useful in the treatment of patients who have type 2 diabetes that is not controlled with diet. Patients
who developed diabetes after age 40 and have had diabetes less than 5 years are most likely to respond well to oral
glucose-lowering agents. Patients with long-standing disease may require a combination of oral agents with or
without insulin to control hyperglycemia. Figure 24.10 summarizes the duration of action of some of the oral
glucose-lowering drugs, and Figure 24.11 illustrates some of the common adverse effects.

--- PAGE 911 ---

A.  Sulfonylureas
These agents are classified as insulin secretagogues, because they promote insulin release from the β cells of the
pancreas. The sulfonylureas most used in clinical practice are the second-generation drugs glyburide [GLYE-byoor-
ide], glipizide [GLIP-ih-zide], and glimepiride [GLYE-me-pih-ride].
1.  Mechanism of action
These agents stimulate insulin release from the β cells of the pancreas. Sulfonylureas block ATP-sensitive K+
channels, resulting in depolarization, Ca2+ influx, and insulin exocytosis. In addition, sulfonylureas may reduce
hepatic glucose production and increase peripheral insulin sensitivity.
2.  Pharmacokinetics
Given orally, these drugs bind to serum proteins, are metabolized by the liver, and are excreted in the urine and
feces. The duration of action ranges from 12 to 24 hours.
3.  Adverse effects
Adverse effects of the sulfonylureas include hypoglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and weight gain. They should be used
with caution in hepatic or renal insufficiency, since accumulation of sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia. Renal
impairment is a particular problem for glyburide, as it may increase the duration of action and increase the risk of
hypoglycemia significantly. Glipizide or glimepiride are safer options in renal dysfunction and in elderly patients.
Figure 24.12 summarizes some drug interactions with sulfonylureas.

B.  Glinides
This class of agents includes repaglinide [re-PAG-lin-ide] and nateglinide [nuh-TAY-gli-nide]. Glinides are also
considered insulin secretagogues.
1.  Mechanism of action
Like the sulfonylureas, the glinides stimulate insulin secretion. In contrast to the sulfonylureas, the glinides have a
rapid onset and a short duration of action. They are particularly effective in the early release of insulin that occurs
after a meal and are categorized as postprandial glucose regulators. Glinides should not be used in combination with
sulfonylureas due to overlapping mechanisms of action and increased risk of serious hypoglycemia.
2.  Pharmacokinetics
Glinides should be taken prior to a meal and are well absorbed after oral administration. Both glinides are
metabolized to inactive products by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4; see Chapter 1) in the liver and are excreted
through the bile.
3.  Adverse effects
Although glinides cause hypoglycemia and weight gain, the incidence is lower than that with sulfonylureas. By
inhibiting hepatic metabolism, the lipid-lowering drug gemfibrozil  may significantly increase the effects of
repaglinide, and concurrent use is contraindicated. These agents should be used with caution in patients with hepatic
impairment.
913

--- PAGE 914 ---

C.  Biguanides
Metformin [met-FOR-min], the only biguanide, is classified as an insulin sensitizer. It increases glucose uptake and
use by target tissues, thereby decreasing insulin resistance. Unlike sulfonylureas, metformin does not promote
insulin secretion. Therefore, the risk of hypoglycemia is far less than that with sulfonylureas. Metformin is also
useful in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome, as it reduces insulin resistance seen in this disorder.
1.  Mechanism of action
The main mechanism of action of metformin is reduction of hepatic gluconeogenesis. [Note: Excess glucose
produced by the liver is a major source of high blood glucose in type 2 diabetes, accounting for high fasting blood
glucose.] Metformin also slows intestinal absorption of sugars and improves peripheral glucose uptake and
utilization. Weight loss may occur because metformin causes loss of appetite. The ADA recommends metformin as
the initial drug of choice for type 2 diabetes. Metformin may be used alone or in combination with other oral agents
or insulin. Hypoglycemia may occur when metformin is taken in combination with insulin or insulin secretagogues,
so adjustment in dosage may be required.
2.  Pharmacokinetics
Metformin is well absorbed after oral administration, is not bound to serum proteins, and is not metabolized.
Excretion is via the urine.
3.  Adverse effects
These are largely gastrointestinal, including diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects can be alleviated by
titrating the dose of metformin slowly and administering doses with meals. Metformin is contraindicated in renal
dysfunction due to the risk of lactic acidosis. It should be discontinued in cases of acute myocardial infarction,
exacerbation of heart failure, sepsis, or other disorders that can cause acute renal failure. Metformin should be used
with caution in patients older than 80 years and in those with heart failure or alcohol abuse. It should be temporarily
discontinued in patients undergoing procedures requiring IV radiographic contrast. Rarely, potentially fatal lactic
acidosis has occurred. Long-term use may be associated with vitamin B12 deficiency, and periodic measurement of
vitamin B12 levels is recommended, especially in patients with anemia or peripheral neuropathy.

--- PAGE 915 ---

D.  Thiazolidinediones
The thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are also insulin sensitizers. The two agents in this class are pioglitazone [pye-oh-
GLI-ta-zone] and rosiglitazone [roe-si-GLIH-ta-zone]. Although insulin is required for their action, the TZDs do not
promote its release from the β cells, so hyperinsulinemia is not a risk.
1.  Mechanism of action
The TZDs lower insulin resistance by acting as agonists for the peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-γ
(PPARγ), a nuclear hormone receptor. Activation of PPARγ regulates the transcription of several insulin responsive
genes, resulting in increased insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle. The TZDs can be used
as monotherapy or in combination with other glucose-lowering agents or insulin. The dose of insulin may have to be
lowered when used in combination with these agents. The ADA recommends pioglitazone as a second- or third-line
agent for type 2 diabetes. Rosiglitazone is less utilized due to concerns regarding cardiovascular adverse effects.
2.  Pharmacokinetics
Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone are well absorbed after oral administration and are extensively bound to serum
albumin. Both undergo extensive metabolism by different CYP450 isozymes (see Chapter 1). Some metabolites of
pioglitazone have activity. Renal elimination of pioglitazone is negligible, with the majority of active drug and
metabolites excreted in the bile and eliminated in the feces. Metabolites of rosiglitazone are primarily excreted in the
urine. No dosage adjustment is required in renal impairment.
3.  Adverse effects
Liver toxicity has occasionally been reported with these drugs, and baseline and periodic monitoring of liver
function is recommended. Weight gain can occur because TZDs may increase subcutaneous fat and cause fluid
retention. [Note: Fluid retention can worsen heart failure. These drugs should be avoided in patients with severe
heart failure.] TZDs have been associated with osteopenia and increased fracture risk in women. Pioglitazone may
also increase the risk of bladder cancer. Additionally, rosiglitazone carries a boxed warning about the potential
increased risk of myocardial infarction and angina with the use of this agent.

--- PAGE 916 ---

E.  a-Glucosidase inhibitors
Acarbose [AY-car-bose] and miglitol  [MIG-li-tol] are oral agents used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
1.  Mechanism of action
Located in the intestinal brush border, α-glucosidase enzymes break down carbohydrates into glucose and other
simple sugars that can be absorbed. Acarbose and miglitol  reversibly inhibit α-glucosidase enzymes. When taken at
the start of a meal, these drugs delay the digestion of carbohydrates, resulting in lower postprandial glucose levels.
Since they do not stimulate insulin release or increase insulin sensitivity, these agents do not cause hypoglycemia
when used as monotherapy. However, when used with insulin secretagogues or insulin, hypoglycemia may develop.
[Note: It is important that hypoglycemia in this context be treated with glucose rather than sucrose, because sucrase
is also inhibited by these drugs.]
2.  Pharmacokinetics
Acarbose is poorly absorbed. It is metabolized primarily by intestinal bacteria, and some of the metabolites are
absorbed and excreted into the urine. Miglitol  is very well absorbed but has no systemic effects. It is excreted
unchanged by the kidney.
3.  Adverse effects
The most common adverse effects are flatulence, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping. Adverse effects limit the use of
these agents in clinical practice. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease, colonic ulceration, or intestinal
obstruction should not use these drugs.

F.  Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors
Alogliptin [al-oh-GLIP-tin], linagliptin [lin-a-GLIP-tin], saxagliptin [sax-a-GLIP-tin], and sitagliptin [si-ta-GLIP-
tin] are oral dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
1.  Mechanism of action
These drugs inhibit the enzyme DPP-4, which is responsible for the inactivation of incretin hormones such as GLP-1
(Figure 24.13). Prolonging the activity of incretin hormones increases release of insulin in response to meals and
reduces inappropriate secretion of glucagon. DPP-4 inhibitors may be used as monotherapy or in combination with
sulfonylureas, metformin, TZDs, or insulin. Treatment guidelines do not recommend the combination of DPP-4
inhibitors with GLP-1 receptor agonists for management of diabetes due to overlapping mechanisms and toxicity.
Unlike GLP-1 receptor agonists, these drugs do not cause satiety or fullness and are weight neutral.
Figure 24.13 Mechanism of action of DPP-4 inhibitors. DPP-4 = dipeptidyl peptidase-4.
GIP = glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide; GLP-1 = glucagon-like peptide-1.
2.  Pharmacokinetics
The DPP-4 inhibitors are well absorbed after oral administration. Food does not affect the extent of absorption.
Alogliptin and sitagliptin are mostly excreted unchanged in the urine. Saxagliptin is metabolized via CYP450 3A4/5
to an active metabolite. The primary route of elimination for saxagliptin and the metabolite is renal. Linagliptin is
primarily eliminated via the enterohepatic system. All DPP-4 inhibitors except linagliptin require dosage
adjustments in renal dysfunction.
3.  Adverse effects
In general, DPP-4 inhibitors are well tolerated, with the most common adverse effects being nasopharyngitis and
headache. Although infrequent, pancreatitis has occurred with the use of DPP-4 inhibitors. Agents in this class may
also increase the risk of severe, disabling joint pain. Alogliptin and saxagliptin have also been shown to increase the
risk of heart failure hospitalizations and should be used with caution in patients with or at risk for heart failure.

G.  Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors
Canagliflozin [kan-a-gli-FLOE-zin], dapagliflozin [dap-a-gli-FLOE- zin], empagliflozin [em-pa-gli-FLOE-zin], and
ertugliflozin [er-too-gli-FLOE-zin] are oral agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Empagliflozin is also
indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
1.  Mechanism of action
The sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) is responsible for reabsorbing filtered glucose in the tubular lumen of
the kidney. By inhibiting SGLT2, these agents decrease reabsorption of glucose, increase urinary glucose excretion,
and lower blood glucose. Inhibition of SGLT2 also decreases reabsorption of sodium and causes osmotic diuresis.
Therefore, SGLT2 inhibitors may reduce systolic blood pressure. However, they are not indicated for the treatment
of hypertension.
2.  Pharmacokinetics
These agents are given once daily in the morning. Canagliflozin should be taken before the first meal of the day. All
drugs are mainly metabolized by glucuronidation to inactive metabolites. These agents should be avoided in patients
with renal dysfunction.
3.  Adverse effects
The most common adverse effects with SGLT2 inhibitors are female genital mycotic infections (for example,
vulvovaginal candidiasis), urinary tract infections, and urinary frequency. Hypotension has also occurred,
particularly in the elderly or patients on diuretics. Thus, volume status should be evaluated prior to starting these
agents. Ketoacidosis has been reported with use of SGLT2 inhibitors, and these agents should be used with caution
in patients with risk factors that predispose to ketoacidosis (for example, alcohol abuse and caloric restriction related
to surgery or illness).

H.  Other agents
Both the dopamine agonist bromocriptine and the bile acid sequestrant colesevelam produce modest reductions in
HbA1c. The mechanism of action of glucose lowering is unknown for both of these drugs. Although bromocriptine
and colesevelam are indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, their modest efficacy, adverse effects, and pill
burden limit their use in clinical practice.

24.6Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
Which of the following statements is correct regarding insulin glargine?
A.  It is primarily used to control postprandial hyperglycemia.
B.  It is a “peakless” insulin.
C.  The prolonged duration of activity is due to slow dissociation from albumin.
D.  It should not be used in a regimen with insulin lispro or glulisine.
Correct answer = B. Insulin glargine has a relatively flat, prolonged hypoglycemic effect. Because of this, it is
used for basal glucose control, not postprandial. The prolonged duration is due to its low pH, which leads to
precipitation at the injection site and resultant extended action. Insulin glargine is often used for basal control in a
regimen where insulin lispro, glulisine, or aspart are used for mealtime glucose control. [Note: Glargine should
not be combined with other insulins in the same syringe, as it may alter the pharmacodynamic properties of the
medication.]
MC is a patient with type 2 diabetes currently being treated with insulin detemir. The physician determines
that MC needs additional insulin therapy for control of postprandial glucose. Which agent is most
appropriate to add at this time?
A.  Insulin degludec
B.  NPH insulin
C.  Insulin lispro
D.  NPH/regular 70/30 insulin
Correct answer = C. Insulin lispro is a rapid-acting insulin that has an onset of action within 15 to 30 minutes.
Rapid-acting insulins are administered to mimic the prandial (mealtime) release of insulin and control
postprandial glucose levels. Insulin degludec is a long-acting insulin used to control fasting glucose levels. NPH
insulin is an intermediate-acting insulin also used for basal (fasting) control. NPH/regular 70/30 insulin is a
mixture of NPH (intermediate-acting) and regular (short-acting) insulin. The patient is already on a long-acting
insulin (detemir) for basal control, and another insulin for basal control is not warranted.
Which class of oral diabetes drugs is paired most appropriately with its primary mechanism of action?
A.  DPP-4 inhibitor—inhibits breakdown of complex carbohydrates
B.  SGLT2 inhibitor—increases urinary excretion of glucose
C.  Sulfonylurea—increases insulin sensitivity
D.  Thiazolidinedione—decreases hepatic gluconeogenesis
Correct answer = B. SGLT2 inhibitors work by inhibiting the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), resulting
in decreased reabsorption of glucose in the kidney and increased urinary excretion. Sulfonylureas work primarily
by increasing insulin secretion through stimulation of the β cells in the pancreas. DPP-4 inhibitors work by
inhibiting breakdown of incretins, thereby increasing postprandial insulin secretion, decreasing postprandial
glucagon, etc. TZDs work primarily by increasing insulin sensitivity.
Which of the following statements is characteristic of metformin?
A.  Metformin contains a boxed warning due to the potential for increased risk of myocardial infarction.
B.  Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production.
C.  Metformin can be used safely in patients with renal dysfunction.
D.  Weight gain is a common adverse effect.
Correct answer = B. Metformin works by inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis. The primary adverse effects
associated with metformin are gastrointestinal and in rare cases, lactic acidosis. Metformin does not carry a
warning for increased risk of myocardial infarction (this is the case for rosiglitazone). Metformin is
contraindicated in renal dysfunction due to the risk of lactic acidosis. Unlike the sulfonylureas and insulin, weight
gain is not an adverse effect, and some patients actually lose weight due to GI side effects.
Which is the most appropriate initial oral agent for management of type 2 diabetes in patients with no other
comorbid conditions?
A.  Glipizide
B.  Empagliflozin
C.  Metformin
D.  Pioglitazone
Correct answer = C. Metformin is the preferred initial agent for management of type 2 diabetes. See Figure 24.15.
A 64-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes is diagnosed with heart failure. Which of the
following medications would be a poor choice for controlling her diabetes?

24.9
24.10B.  Glyburide
C.  Pioglitazone
D.  Insulin
Correct answer = C. The TZDs (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) can cause fluid retention and lead to a worsening
of heart failure. They should be used with caution and dose reduction, if at all, in patients with heart failure.
Exenatide, glyburide, and insulin do not have precautions for use in heart failure patients.
KD is a 69-year-old male with type 2 diabetes and chronic pancreatitis. Which of the following diabetes
medications is contraindicated in this patient?
A.  Glipizide
B.  Insulin lispro
C.  Metformin
D.  Dulaglutide
Correct answer = D. Dulaglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist. Although infrequent, GLP-1 receptor agonists have
been associated with pancreatitis and should be avoided in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Glipizide, insulin
lispro, and metformin have not been associated with an increased risk of pancreatitis.
Which of the following drugs for diabetes is LEAST likely to cause weight gain?
A.  Liraglutide
B.  Pioglitazone
C.  Repaglinide
D.  Insulin glulisine
Correct answer = A. GLP-1 receptor agonists are usually associated with weight loss due to their ability to
enhance satiety. All of the other agents are associated with weight gain.
HB is a 55-year-old obese female who has had type 2 diabetes for 10 years. She is currently being treated
with metformin, but her HbA1c is above goal. She has a history of heart failure and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disorder. Her physician would like to add a medication that will not cause any weight gain.
Which of the following would be most appropriate to control HB’s diabetes?
A.  Linagliptin
B.  Glimepiride
C.  Pioglitazone
D.  Inhaled insulin
Correct answer = A. Linagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, and this class of medications is effective in lowering HbA1c
levels without causing weight gain (they are usually weight neutral). Sulfonylureas (glimepiride) are associated
with weight gain and should be avoided in this obese patient. TZDs (pioglitazone) should be avoided in patients
with heart failure. Because of the potential for bronchospasm associated with inhaled insulin, it should be avoided
in patients with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder and asthma.
Which of the following diabetes medications is most appropriately paired with an adverse effect associated
with its use?
A.  Canagliflozin—urinary tract infections
B.  Nateglinide—heart failure
C.  Glipizide—weight loss
D.  Liraglutide—lactic acidosis
Correct answer = A. Adverse effects of canagliflozin are genital mycotic infections, urinary tract infections, and
urinary frequency. Nateglinide may cause hypoglycemia but has not been associated with heart failure.
Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain. Lactic acidosis is a rare but serious side effect of metformin (not
liraglutide).922

Estrogens and Androgens

I.  Overview
Estrogens and androgens are sex hormones produced by the gonads. These hormones are necessary for conception,
embryonic maturation, and development of primary and secondary sexual characteristics at puberty. The sex
hormones are used therapeutically for contraception, management of menopausal symptoms, and replacement
therapy in hormone deficiency. Several antagonists are effective in the treatment or prevention of hormone-
responsive cancers. Sex hormones are synthesized from the precursor, cholesterol, in a series of steps that includes
shortening of the hydrocarbon side chain and hydroxylation of the steroid nucleus. Aromatization is the last step in
estrogen synthesis. Figure 25.1 lists the sex hormones discussed in this chapter.

II.  Estrogens
Estradiol  [ess-tra-DYE-ole] is the most potent estrogen produced and secreted by the ovary. It is the principal
estrogen in premenopausal women. Estrone [ESS-trone] is a metabolite of estradiol  that has approximately one-third
the estrogenic potency of estradiol . Estrone is the primary circulating estrogen after menopause, and it is generated
mainly from conversion of dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA] in adipose tissue. Estriol  [ess-TRI-ole], another
metabolite of estradiol , is significantly less potent than is estradiol . It is present in significant amounts during
pregnancy, because it is synthesized by the placenta. Synthetic estrogens, such as ethinyl estradiol  [ETH-ih-nil ess-
tra-DYE-ole], undergo less first-pass metabolism than do naturally occurring hormones and, thus, are effective when
administered orally at lower doses.
927
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 928 ---

A.  Mechanism of action
After dissociation from their binding sites on sex hormone–binding globulin or albumin in the plasma, steroid
hormones (for example, estradiol ) diffuse across the cell membrane and bind with high affinity to specific nuclear
receptor proteins (Figure 25.2). The activated steroid–receptor complex interacts with nuclear chromatin to initiate
hormone-specific RNA synthesis. This results in the synthesis of specific proteins that mediate a number of
physiologic functions. [Note: The steroid hormones may elicit the synthesis of different RNA species in diverse
target tissues and, therefore, are both receptor and tissue specific.] Other pathways that require these hormones have
been identified that lead to more rapid actions.

estrogen response element; ER = estrogen receptor; GR = glucocorticoid receptor.

B.  Therapeutic uses
Estrogens are most frequently used for contraception and postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT). In the past,
estrogens were widely used for prevention of osteoporosis; however, due to risks associated with estrogen therapy,
current guidelines recommend use of other therapies, such as bisphosphonates (see Chapter 27).
1.  Postmenopausal HT
The primary indication for estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women is menopausal symptoms, such as vasomotor
instability (for example, “hot flashes” or “hot flushes”) and vaginal atrophy (Figure 25.3). A common oral
preparation used for the treatment of menopausal symptoms is conjugated equine estrogens (obtained from urine of
pregnant mares), which primarily contains sulfate esters of estrone and equilin. Other estrone-based oral
preparations include esterified estrogens and estropipate [ES-troe-PIP-ate]. Transdermal preparations of estradiol
are also effective in treating menopausal symptoms. For women with an intact uterus, a progestogen is always
included with the estrogen therapy, because the combination reduces the risk of endometrial carcinoma associated
with unopposed estrogen. Women who have undergone a hysterectomy may use estrogen alone. [Note: The potency
of estrogen used in HT is substantially less than that of estrogens used in contraception. Thus, the adverse effects of
estrogen replacement therapy are usually less pronounced than those seen in women taking estrogen for
contraceptive purposes.] Use of HT has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and breast
cancer. Thus, HT should be prescribed at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time to relieve
menopausal symptoms. Women who only have urogenital symptoms, such as vaginal atrophy, should be treated
with vaginal rather than systemic estrogen to minimize the risks of use.

Figure 25.3 Benefits associated with postmenopausal estrogen replacement.
2.  Contraception
The combination of an estrogen and progestogen provides effective contraception via the oral, transdermal, or
vaginal route.
3.  Other uses
Estrogen therapy mimicking the natural cyclic pattern, and usually in combination with a progestogen, is instituted
to stimulate development of secondary sex characteristics in young women with primary hypogonadism. Similarly,
replacement therapy is used for women who have hormonal deficiencies due to surgical menopause or premature
ovarian failure.

--- PAGE 932 ---

C.  Pharmacokinetics
1.  Naturally occurring estrogens
These agents and their esterified or conjugated derivatives are readily absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract,
skin, and mucous membranes. Taken orally, estradiol  is rapidly metabolized (and partially inactivated) by the
microsomal enzymes of the liver. Micronized estradiol  has better bioavailability. Although estradiol  is subject to
first-pass metabolism, it is still effective when taken orally.
2.  Synthetic estrogens
These compounds, such as ethinyl estradiol  and estradiol valerate are well absorbed after oral administration.
Estradiol valerate is a prodrug of estradiol  which is rapidly cleaved to estradiol  and valeric acid. The synthetic
estrogens are fat soluble, stored in adipose tissue, and slowly released. These compounds have a prolonged action
and a higher potency compared to the natural estrogens.
3.  Metabolism
Bioavailability of estradiol  after oral administration is low due to first-pass metabolism. To reduce first-pass
metabolism, estradiol  may be administered via a transdermal patch, topical formulation (gel or spray), intravaginal
preparation (tablet, cream, or ring), or injection. Following oral administration, estradiol  is metabolized to estrone
and estriol . Estrogens are transported in the blood bound to serum albumin or sex hormone–binding globulin.
Estradiol  and its metabolites subsequently undergo glucuronide and sulfate conjugation. In addition, smaller
amounts of estrone and estriol  are metabolized by the hepatic CYP3A4 isoenzyme. Metabolites are mainly excreted
in the urine. The glucuronide and sulfate metabolites are also subject to enterohepatic recirculation. These
compounds are secreted into the bile, hydrolyzed by gut bacteria, and then reabsorbed.
932

--- PAGE 933 ---

D.  Adverse effects
Nausea and breast tenderness are among the most common adverse effects of estrogen therapy. In addition, the risk
of thromboembolic events, myocardial infarction, and breast and endometrial cancer is increased with the use of
estrogen therapy. [Note: The increased risk of endometrial cancer can be offset by including a progestogen along
with the estrogen therapy.] Other effects of estrogen therapy are shown in Figure 25.4.

--- PAGE 934 ---

III.  Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators
SERMs are a class of estrogen-related compounds that display selective agonism or antagonism for estrogen
receptors depending on the tissue type. This category includes tamoxifen, raloxifene, bazedoxifene, clomiphene, and
ospemifene.
934
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 935 ---

A.  Mechanism of action
Tamoxifen [tah-MOKS-ih-fen] and raloxifene [rah-LOX-ih-feen] compete with estrogen for binding to the estrogen
receptor in breast tissue. [Note: Normal breast growth is stimulated by estrogens. Therefore, some hormone-
responsive breast tumors regress following treatment with these agents.] In addition, raloxifene acts as an estrogen
agonist in bone, leading to decreased bone resorption, increased bone density, and decreased vertebral fractures
(Figure 25.5). Unlike estrogen and tamoxifen, raloxifene does not stimulate growth of the endometrium and,
therefore, does not predispose to endometrial cancer. Raloxifene also lowers serum total cholesterol and low-density
lipoprotein (LDL). Like raloxifene, bazedoxifene [BA-ze-DOX-i-feen] antagonizes the action of estrogen on the
uterus. The drug reduces the risk of endometrial hyperplasia with estrogen use. Clomiphene [KLOE-mi-feen] acts as
a partial estrogen agonist and interferes with the negative feedback of estrogens on the hypothalamus. This effect
increases the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone and gonadotropins, thereby leading to stimulation of
ovulation.
Figure 25.5 Hip bone density increases with raloxifene in postmenopausal women.
935
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 936 ---

B.  Therapeutic uses
Tamoxifen is currently used in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, or as adjuvant therapy following
mastectomy or radiation for breast cancer. Both tamoxifen and raloxifene can be used as prophylactic therapy to
reduce the risk of breast cancer in high-risk patients. Raloxifene is also approved for the prevention and treatment of
osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Clomiphene is used in the treatment of infertility. Ospemifene is indicated
for the treatment of dyspareunia (painful sexual intercourse) related to menopause. Bazedoxifene is available in a
combination product with conjugated estrogens. The combination is indicated for the treatment of menopausal
symptoms in women with an intact uterus.
936
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 937 ---

C.  Pharmacokinetics
The SERMs are rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Tamoxifen is extensively metabolized by cytochrome
P450 system, including the formation of active metabolites via the CYP3A4/5 and CYP2D6 isoenzymes. [Note:
Patients with a genetic polymorphism in CYP2D6 may produce less active metabolite, resulting in diminished
activity of tamoxifen.] Raloxifene is rapidly converted to glucuronide conjugates through first-pass metabolism.
These agents undergo enterohepatic cycling, and the primary route of excretion is through the bile into feces.
937
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 938 ---

D.  Adverse effects
The most frequent adverse effects of tamoxifen are hot flashes and nausea. Due to its estrogenic activity in the
endometrium, endometrial hyperplasia and malignancies have been reported with tamoxifen therapy. This has led to
recommendations for limiting the length of time on the drug for some indications. Because it is metabolized by
various CYP450 isoenzymes, tamoxifen is subject to many drug interactions. [Note: Tamoxifen is also an inhibitor of
P-glycoprotein.] Some CYP450 inhibitors may prevent the formation of active metabolites of tamoxifen and
possibly reduce the efficacy (for example, amiodarone, haloperidol , paroxetine). Hot flashes and leg cramps are
common adverse effects with raloxifene. In addition, there is an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis and
pulmonary embolism. Women who have a past or active history of venous thromboembolic events should not take
the drug. Adverse effects of clomiphene are dose-related and include headache, nausea, vasomotor flushes, visual
disturbances, and ovarian enlargement. Use of clomiphene increases the risk of multiple gestation, usually twins.
Ospemifene may stimulate endometrial growth, and addition of a progestogen in women with an intact uterus should
be considered.
938

--- PAGE 939 ---

IV.  Progestogens
Progesterone, the natural progestogen, is produced in response to luteinizing hormone (LH) by both females
(secreted by the corpus luteum, primarily during the second half of the menstrual cycle, and by the placenta) and by
males (secreted by the testes). It is also synthesized by the adrenal cortex in both sexes.
939
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 940 ---

A.  Mechanism of action
Progestogens exert their effects in a manner analogous to that of the other steroid hormones. In females,
progesterone promotes the development of a secretory endometrium that can accommodate implantation of a newly
forming embryo. The high levels of progesterone that are released during the second half of the menstrual cycle (the
luteal phase) inhibit the production of gonadotropin and, therefore, prevent further ovulation. If conception takes
place, progesterone continues to be secreted, maintaining the endometrium in a favorable state for the continuation
of the pregnancy and reducing uterine contractions. If conception does not take place, the release of progesterone
from the corpus luteum ceases abruptly. The decline in progesterone stimulates the onset of menstruation. Figure
25.6 summarizes the hormones produced during the menstrual cycle.

B.  Therapeutic uses
The major clinical uses of progestogens are for contraception or hormone replacement therapy. For both
contraception and HT, progestogens are often used in combination with estrogens. Progesterone is not used as a
contraceptive therapy because of its rapid metabolism, resulting in low bioavailability. Synthetic progestogens (that
is, progestins) used for contraception are more stable to first-pass metabolism, allowing lower doses when
administered orally. These agents include desogestrel  [des-oh-JES-trel], dienogest  [dye-EN-oh-jest], drospirenone
[droe-SPY-re-none], levonorgestrel  [lee-voe-nor-JES-trel], norethindrone [nor-ETH-in-drone], norethindrone
acetate, norgestimate [nor-JES-tih-mate], and norgestrel  [nor-JES-trel]. Medroxyprogesterone [me-DROK-see-
proe-JES-ter-one] acetate is an injectable contraceptive, and the oral form is a common progestin component of
postmenopausal HT. Progestogens are also used for the control of dysfunctional uterine bleeding, treatment of
dysmenorrhea, and management of endometriosis and infertility.
942
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 943 ---

C.  Pharmacokinetics
A micronized preparation of progesterone is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. It has a short half-life in the
plasma and is metabolized by the liver to pregnanediol and glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. The metabolites are
excreted primarily in the urine. Synthetic progestins are less rapidly metabolized. Oral medroxyprogesterone acetate
has a half-life of 30 hours. When injected intramuscularly or subcutaneously, the drug has a half-life of about 40 to
50 days and provides contraception for approximately 3 months. The other progestins have half-lives of 7 to 30
hours, allowing for once-daily dosing.
943
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 944 ---

D.  Adverse effects
The major adverse effects associated with the use of progestins are headache, depression, weight gain, and changes
in libido (Figure 25.7). Progestins that are derived from 19-nortestosterone (for example, norethindrone,
norethindrone acetate, norgestrel , levonorgestrel ) possess some androgenic activity because of their structural
similarity to testosterone and can cause acne and hirsutism. Less androgenic progestins, such as norgestimate and
drospirenone, may be preferred in women with acne. Drospirenone may raise serum potassium due to
antimineralocorticoid effects, and concurrent use with other drugs that increase potassium (for example, angiotensin-
converting enzyme inhibitors) may increase the risk of hyperkalemia.

--- PAGE 946 ---

E.  Antiprogestin
Mifepristone [mih-feh-PRIH-stone] (also designated as RU-486) is a progesterone antagonist. Administration of this
drug results in termination of pregnancy due to interference with the progesterone needed to maintain pregnancy.
Mifepristone is often combined with the prostaglandin analog misoprostol  to induce uterine contractions. The major
adverse effects are abdominal pain, uterine bleeding, and the possibility of an incomplete abortion.

V.  Contraceptives
Contraceptives may be hormonal or nonhormonal (for example, condom, diaphragm, contraceptive sponge, and
copper intrauterine device). Figure 25.8 outlines the frequency of use for various hormonal and nonhormonal
methods of contraception. An overview of the hormonal methods of contraception is provided below.

--- PAGE 948 ---

A.  Types of hormonal contraceptives
1.  Combination oral contraceptives
A combination of estrogen and progestin is the most common type of oral contraceptive. [Note: The most common
estrogen in combination pills is ethinyl estradiol . The most common progestins are norethindrone, norethindrone
acetate, levonorgestrel , desogestrel , norgestimate, and drospirenone.] These preparations are highly effective in
achieving contraception (Figure 25.9). Monophasic combination pills contain a constant dose of estrogen and
progestin given over 21 to 24 days. Triphasic oral contraceptive products attempt to mimic the natural female cycle
and usually contain a constant dose of estrogen with increasing doses of progestin given over 21 days. With most
oral contraceptives, active pills are taken for 21 to 24 days, followed by 4 to 7 days of placebo, for a total regimen of
28 days. Withdrawal bleeding occurs during the hormone-free (placebo) interval. Use of extended-cycle
contraception (84 active pills followed by 7 days of placebo) results in less frequent withdrawal bleeding. A
continuous oral contraceptive product (active pills taken every day) is also available.
Figure 25.9 Comparison of failure rate for various methods of contraception with typical
use. Longer bars indicate a higher failure rate—that is, more pregnancies.
2.  Transdermal patch
The contraceptive transdermal patch contains ethinyl estradiol  and the progestin norelgestromin. During the 28-day
cycle, one patch is applied each week for 3 weeks to the abdomen, upper torso, or buttock. No patch is worn during
the 4th week, and withdrawal bleeding occurs. The transdermal patch has efficacy comparable to that of the oral
contraceptives, but it is less effective in women weighing greater than 90 kg. Total estrogen exposure with the
transdermal patch may be significantly greater than that seen with oral contraceptives.
948
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 949 ---

3.  Vaginal ring
The contraceptive vaginal ring contains ethinyl estradiol  and etonogestrel . The ring is inserted into the vagina and
left in place for 3 weeks. After 3 weeks, the ring is removed, and withdrawal bleeding occurs during the 4th week.
4.  Progestin-only pills
Progestin-only pills (the “mini-pill”) contain a progestin, usually norethindrone, and are administered daily to
deliver a low, continuous dosage of drug. These preparations are less effective than combination oral contraceptives,
and irregular menstrual cycles may be more frequent. Progestin-only pills may be used in patients who are breast-
feeding (unlike estrogen, progestins do not have an effect on milk production) or who have intolerance or
contraindications to estrogen-containing products.
5.  Injectable progestin
Medroxyprogesterone acetate is a contraceptive that is administered via intramuscular or subcutaneous injection
every 3 months. This product provides high sustained levels of progestin, and many women experience amenorrhea
with medroxyprogesterone acetate. In addition, return to fertility may be delayed for several months after
discontinuation. Weight gain is a common adverse effect. Medroxyprogesterone acetate may contribute to bone loss
and predispose patients to osteoporosis and/or fractures. Therefore, the drug should not be continued for more than 2
years unless the patient is unable to tolerate other contraceptive options.
6.  Progestin implants
After subdermal placement in the upper arm, the etonogestrel  implant offers contraception for up to 3 years. The
implant is as reliable as sterilization, and the contraceptive effect is reversible when removed. [Note: Progestin
implants and intrauterine devices are known as long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC).] Adverse effects
include irregular menstrual bleeding and headaches. The etonogestrel  implant has not been studied in women who
weigh more than 130% of ideal body weight and may be less effective in this population.
7.  Progestin intrauterine device
Various levonorgestrel -releasing intrauterine devices offer a highly effective method of contraception for 3 to 5
years. This is a suitable method of contraception for women who desire long-term contraception. It should be
avoided in patients with pelvic inflammatory disease or a history of ectopic pregnancy. The levonorgestrel
intrauterine device is a highly effective treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding. [Note: The nonhormonal copper
intrauterine device provides contraception for up to 10 years.]
8.  Postcoital contraception
Postcoital or emergency contraception reduces the probability of pregnancy after intercourse without effective
contraception (Figure 25.10) to between 0.2% and 3%. The most common method of emergency contraception uses
a single high dose of levonorgestrel . For maximum effectiveness, emergency contraception should be taken as soon
as possible after unprotected intercourse and preferably within 72 hours. The levonorgestrel  emergency
contraceptive regimens are generally better tolerated than the estrogen–progestin combination regimens. An
alternative emergency contraceptive is the progesterone agonist/antagonist ulipristal  [ue-li-PRIS-tal]. It is indicated
for emergency contraception within 5 days of unprotected intercourse.

mid-twenties.
950
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 951 ---

B.  Mechanism of action
Exogenously administered estrogen in contraceptives provides negative feedback which blunts release of follicle-
stimulating hormone (FSH) by the pituitary gland and progestin inhibits LH secretion, thus preventing ovulation.
Progestin also thickens the cervical mucus, thus hampering the transport of sperm. Withdrawal of the progestin
stimulates menstrual bleeding during the placebo week.
951
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 952 ---

C.  Adverse effects
The incidence of adverse effects with contraceptives is determined by the specific compounds and combinations
used. The most common adverse effects with estrogens are breast fullness, fluid retention, headache, and nausea.
Increased blood pressure may also occur. Progestins may be associated with depression, changes in libido, hirsutism,
and acne. Although rare, thromboembolism, thrombophlebitis, myocardial infarction, and stroke may occur with use
of estrogen-containing contraceptives. These severe adverse effects are most common among women who are over
age 35 and smoke, and estrogen-containing contraceptives should be avoided in this population. Progestin-only
products are preferred in older women who are smokers, due to a lower risk of severe adverse effects. The incidence
of cervical cancer may be increased with hormonal contraceptives, because women are less likely to use barrier
methods of contraception that reduce exposure to human papillomavirus, the primary risk factor for cervical cancer.
[Note: Oral contraceptives are associated with a decreased risk of endometrial and ovarian cancer.] Oral
contraceptives are contraindicated in the presence of cerebrovascular and thromboembolic disease, estrogen-
dependent neoplasms, liver disease, and pregnancy. Drugs that induce the CYP3A4 isoenzyme (for example,
rifampin and bosentan) significantly reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptives. Concurrent use of these agents with
oral contraceptives should be avoided, or an alternate barrier method of contraception should be utilized. Antibiotics
that alter normal gastrointestinal flora may reduce enterohepatic recycling of estrogen, thereby diminishing
effectiveness of oral contraceptives. Patients should be warned of the possible interaction between antibiotics and
oral contraceptives, along with the potential need for an alternate method of contraception during antibiotic therapy.

VI.  Androgens
The androgens are a group of steroids that have anabolic and/or masculinizing effects in both males and females.
Testosterone [tess-TOSS-te-rone], the most important androgen in humans, is synthesized by Leydig cells in the
testes and, in smaller amounts, by thecal cells in the ovaries and by the adrenal gland in both sexes. Other androgens
secreted by the testes are 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), androstenedione, and DHEA in small amounts. In adult
males, testosterone secretion by Leydig cells is controlled by gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the
hypothalamus, which stimulates the anterior pituitary gland to secrete FSH and LH. Testosterone or its active
metabolite, DHT, inhibits production of these specific trophic hormones through a negative feedback loop and, thus,
regulates testosterone production (Figure 25.11). The androgens are required for 1) normal maturation in the male,
2) sperm production, 3) increased synthesis of muscle proteins and hemoglobin, and 4) decreased bone resorption.
Synthetic modifications of the androgen structure modify solubility and susceptibility to metabolism (thus
prolonging the half-life of the hormone), and separate anabolic and androgenic effects.

www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 956 ---

A.  Mechanism of action
Like the estrogens and progestins, androgens bind to a specific nuclear receptor in a target cell. Although
testosterone itself is the active ligand in muscle and liver, in other tissues, it must be metabolized to derivatives,
such as DHT. For example, after diffusing into the cells of the prostate, seminal vesicles, epididymis, and skin,
testosterone is converted by 5α-reductase to DHT, which binds to the receptor.
956
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 957 ---

B.  Therapeutic uses
Androgenic steroids are used for males with primary hypogonadism (caused by testicular dysfunction) or secondary
hypogonadism (due to failure of the hypothalamus or pituitary). [Note: Testosterone replacement should only be
used for males with hypogonadism related to medical conditions and not low testosterone associated with aging.]
Anabolic steroids can be used to treat chronic wasting associated with human immunodeficiency virus or cancer. An
unapproved use of anabolic steroids is to increase lean body mass, muscle strength, and endurance in athletes and
body builders (see below). Because of the potential misuse of testosterone and its derivatives, these agents are
classified as controlled substances. DHEA (a precursor of testosterone and estrogen) has been touted as an antiaging
hormone as well as a “performance enhancer.” There is no definitive evidence that it slows aging, however, or that it
improves performance at normal therapeutic doses. Formulations of testosterone or its derivatives (for example,
methyltestosterone) may be used in combination with estrogen for women with menopausal symptoms unresponsive
to estrogen alone. Danazol  [DAH-nah-zole], a weak androgen, is used in the treatment of endometriosis and
fibrocystic breast disease. [Note: Danazol  also possesses antiestrogenic activity.] Weight gain, acne, decreased
breast size, deepening voice, increased libido, and increased hair growth are among the adverse effects.

C.  Pharmacokinetics
1.  Testosterone
This agent is ineffective orally because of inactivation by first-pass metabolism. Therefore, testosterone is
administered via a transdermal patch, topical gel or solution, buccal tablet, or implantable pellet. Esters of
testosterone (for example, testosterone cypionate or enanthate) are administered intramuscularly. The esterified
formulations are more lipid soluble and have an increased duration of action up to several weeks. Figure 25.12
shows serum levels of testosterone achieved by injection and by a transdermal patch in hypogonadal men. Active
metabolites of testosterone include DHT and estradiol , with activity related to the formation of DHT. Inactive
metabolites are excreted primarily in the urine. Testosterone and its esters demonstrate a 1:1 relative ratio of
androgenic to anabolic activity.

testosterone concentrations after administration by injection or transdermal patch to
hypogonadal men. The yellow band indicates the upper and lower limits of normal.
2.  Testosterone derivatives
Alkylation of the 17α position of testosterone is associated with less hepatic metabolism and allows oral
administration of the hormone. Methyltestosterone and fluoxymesterone [floo-oks-i-MES-te-rone] are examples of
orally administered testosterone derivatives. Oxandrolone [ox-AN-droe-lone] and oxymetholone [OKS-ee-METH-
oh-lone] are orally active 17α-alkylated derivatives of DHT. Oxandrolone has anabolic activity 3 to 13 times that of
testosterone.

--- PAGE 961 ---

D.  Adverse effects
1.  In females
Androgens can cause masculinization, acne, growth of facial hair, deepening of the voice, male pattern baldness, and
excessive muscle development. Menstrual irregularities may also occur. Testosterone should not be used by
pregnant women because of possible virilization of the female fetus.
2.  In males
Excess androgen can cause priapism, impotence, decreased spermatogenesis, gynecomastia, and cosmetic changes
such as those described for females. Androgens can also stimulate growth of the prostate.
3.  In children
Androgens can cause abnormal sexual maturation and growth disturbances resulting from premature closing of the
epiphyseal plates.
4.  General effects
Androgens can increase serum LDL and lower serum high-density lipoprotein levels. They may also cause fluid
retention and peripheral edema. Testosterone replacement therapy has been associated with a possible increased risk
of myocardial infarction and stroke. Hepatic adverse effects have been associated with the 17α-alkylated androgens.
Local skin irritation is a common adverse effect with topical formulations.
5.  In athletes
Use of anabolic steroids (for example, DHEA) by athletes can cause premature closing of the epiphysis of the long
bones, which stunts growth and interrupts development. High doses taken by young athletes may result in reduction
of testicular size, hepatic abnormalities, increased aggression (“roid rage”), major mood disorders, and other adverse
effects described above.

--- PAGE 962 ---

E.  Antiandrogens
Antiandrogens counter male hormonal action by interfering with the synthesis of androgens or by blocking their
receptors. Antiandrogens, such as flutamide [FLOO-tah-mide], bicalutamide [bye-ka-LOO-ta-mide], enzalutamide
[enz-a-LOO-ta-mide], and nilutamide [nye-LOO-ta-mide], act as competitive inhibitors of androgens at the target
cell and are effective orally for the treatment of prostate cancer (see Chapter 35). Finasteride [fin-AS-ter-ide] and
dutasteride [doo-TAS-ter-ride] inhibit 5α-reductase, resulting in decreased formation of dihydrotestosterone. These
agents are used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (see Chapter 41).

25.6Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
A 53-year-old woman has severe vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes) associated with menopause. She has no
pertinent past medical or surgical history. Which would be most appropriate for her symptoms?
A.  Conjugated estrogens vaginal cream
B.  Estradiol  transdermal patch
C.  Oral estradiol  and medroxyprogesterone acetate
D.  Injectable medroxyprogesterone acetate
Correct answer = C. Estrogen vaginal cream only treats vaginal symptoms of menopause such as vaginal atrophy
and does not treat hot flushes. Since this patient has an intact uterus, a progestin such as medroxyprogesterone
needs to be used along with the estrogen to prevent the development of endometrial hyperplasia. Unopposed
estrogen (for example, the estradiol transdermal patch) should not be used. Injectable medroxyprogesterone
acetate is used for contraception.
A 70-year-old woman is being treated with raloxifene for osteoporosis. Which is a concern with this therapy?
A.  Breast cancer
B.  Endometrial cancer
C.  Venous thrombosis
D.  Hypercholesterolemia
Correct answer = C. Raloxifene can increase the risk of venous thromboembolism. Unlike estrogen and
tamoxifen, raloxifene does not result in an increased incidence of endometrial cancer. Raloxifene lowers the risk
of breast cancer in high-risk women, and it also lowers LDL cholesterol.
Which is the most appropriate oral contraceptive for a patient with moderate acne?
A.  Ethinyl estradiol /levonorgestrel
B.  Ethinyl estradiol /norethindrone acetate
C.  Ethinyl estradiol /norgestimate
D.  Ulipristal
Correct answer = C. The progestins levonorgestrel and norethindrone acetate may have androgenic activity and
contribute to acne. Norgestimate has less androgenic activity and is preferred for this patient. Ulipristal is an
emergency contraceptive and should not be used as a regular method of contraception.
A 25-year-old woman is using injectable medroxyprogesterone acetate as a method of contraception. Which
adverse effect is a concern if she wishes to use this therapy long-term?
A.  Hyperkalemia
B.  Male pattern baldness
C.  Osteoporosis
D.  Weight loss
Correct answer = C. Medroxyprogesterone acetate may contribute to bone loss and predispose patients to
osteoporosis and/or fractures. Therefore, the drug should not be continued for more than 2 years if possible. The
drug often causes weight gain, not weight loss. The other adverse effects are not associated with
medroxyprogesterone.
Which contraceptive method provides long-acting reversible contraception (LARC)?
A.  Contraceptive vaginal ring
B.  Intrauterine device
C.  Extended-cycle oral contraceptives
D.  Transdermal contraceptive patch
Correct answer = B. The progestin-only intrauterine devices provide contraception for 3 to 5 years, depending on
the device. The etonogestrel  subdermal implant is another LARC that provides contraception for 3 years. The
contraceptive vaginal ring is worn for 3 weeks at a time, and the transdermal patch for 1 week at a time. Extended
cycle oral contraceptives must be administered daily.
Which is the most effective form of contraception with typical use?
A.  Combined oral contraceptives
B.  Progestin-only “mini-pill”
C.  Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injection
D.  Subdermal progestin implant
Correct answer = D. See Figure 25.9. The subdermal implant has a very low failure rate, since it does not require
adherence of the patient after implantation. Progestin-only pills are less effective than combined oral963

A 36-year-old woman requests birth control. She has no medical conditions, and she smokes one pack of
cigarettes per day. Which would be the most appropriate to recommend?
A.  Vaginal contraceptive ring
B.  Transdermal contraceptive patch
C.  Progestin-only “mini-pill”
D.  Combination oral contraceptive pill
Correct answer = C. Progestin-only products are preferred in older women who are smokers, due to a lower risk
of severe adverse effects, such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Estrogen-containing contraceptives are not
recommended in women over the age of 35 who are smokers. The vaginal contraceptive ring, transdermal
contraceptive patch, and combination oral contraceptive pills all contain estrogen.
A 22-year-old woman requests emergency contraception after unprotected intercourse that occurred 1 day
ago. She has no medical conditions. Which agent is most appropriate?
A.  Ethinyl estradiol /norgestimate
B.  Etonogestrel
C.  Levonorgestrel
D.  Mifepristone
Correct answer = C. A single dose of levonorgestrel  is preferred for emergency contraception and should be
administered within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse for best efficacy. Estrogen/progestin regimens are less
used for emergency contraception due to a higher incidence of adverse effects such as nausea/vomiting.
Etonogestrel  is a progestin used in the contraceptive ring and implant. Mifepristone is a progesterone antagonist
used to terminate pregnancy once it has occurred.
A 35-year-old woman is experiencing infertility due to anovulation. Which agent is most appropriate for this
patient?
A.  Clomiphene
B.  Ospemifene
C.  Raloxifene
D.  Ulipristal
Correct answer = A. Clomiphene is a SERM that interferes with negative feedback of estrogens on the
hypothalamus, thereby increasing the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone and gonadotropins, and
leading to stimulation of ovulation. Ospemifene is a SERM indicated for the treatment of dyspareunia. Raloxifene
is a SERM used in the prevention of breast cancer and osteoporosis. Ulipristal  is a progesterone
agonist/antagonist used as an emergency contraceptive.
Use of testosterone is most appropriate in which patient?
A.  A 25-year-old competitive athlete
B.  A 30-year-old man with hypogonadism due to testicular injury
C.  A 50-year-old man with low testosterone related to aging
D.  A 65-year-old man with low testosterone and a history of myocardial infarction
Correct answer = B. Testosterone should only be used only for hypogonadism associated with documented
medical conditions and not low testosterone associated with aging. Testosterone replacement may increase the
risk of cardiovascular events and should be used with caution in patients with a history of myocardial infarction
and heart disease. 964

Adrenal Hormones
Shannon Miller and Karen Whalen

www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 966 ---

I.  Overview
The adrenal cortex secretes two types of corticosteroids (glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids; Figure 26.1) and
the adrenal androgens. The adrenal cortex has three zones, and each zone synthesizes a different type of steroid
hormone from cholesterol (Figure 26.2). The outer zona glomerulosa produces mineralocorticoids (for example,
aldosterone) that are responsible for regulating salt and water metabolism. The middle zona fasciculata synthesizes
glucocorticoids (for example, cortisol) that are involved with metabolism and response to stress. The inner zona
reticularis secretes adrenal androgens (see Chapter 25). Secretion by the two inner zones and, to a lesser extent, the
outer zone is controlled by pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH; also called corticotropin), which is
released in response to hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Glucocorticoids serve as feedback
inhibitors of ACTH and CRH secretion.

hormone; CRH = corticotropin-releasing hormone.

--- PAGE 969 ---

II.  Corticosteroids
Corticosteroids differ in their metabolic (glucocorticoid) and electrolyte-regulating (mineralocorticoid) activity. The
corticosteroids bind to specific intracellular cytoplasmic receptors in target tissues. Glucocorticoid receptors are
widely distributed throughout the body, whereas mineralocorticoid receptors are confined mainly to excretory
organs, such as the kidney, colon, salivary glands, and sweat glands. Both types of receptors are found in the brain.
After dimerizing, the receptor–hormone complex recruits coactivator (or corepressor) proteins and translocates into
the nucleus, where it attaches to gene promoter elements. There it acts as a transcription factor to turn genes on
(when complexed with coactivators) or off (when complexed with corepressors), depending on the tissue ( Figure
26.3). Because of this mechanism, some effects of corticosteroids take hours to days to occur. This section describes
normal actions and therapeutic uses of corticosteroids.

--- PAGE 972 ---

A.  Glucocorticoids
Cortisol is the principal human glucocorticoid. Normally, its production is diurnal, with a peak in early morning
followed by a decline and then a secondary, smaller peak in late afternoon. Stress and levels of the circulating
steroid influence secretion. The effects of cortisol are many and diverse. In general, all glucocorticoids:
1.  Promote normal intermediary metabolism
Glucocorticoids stimulate hepatic glucose production by enhancing expression of enzymes involved in
gluconeogenesis. They mobilize amino acids and stimulate lipolysis, thereby providing the building blocks and
energy for glucose synthesis.
2.  Increase resistance to stress
By raising plasma glucose levels, glucocorticoids provide the body with energy to combat stress caused by trauma,
fright, infection, bleeding, or debilitating disease. [Note: Glucocorticoid insufficiency may result in hypoglycemia
(for example, during stressful periods or fasting).]
3.  Alter blood cell levels in plasma
Glucocorticoids cause a decrease in eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes by redistributing them
from the circulation to lymphoid tissue. Glucocorticoids also increase hemoglobin, erythrocytes, platelets, and
polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
4.  Possess anti-inflammatory action
Potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activities are the most important therapeutic properties of
glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids lower circulating lymphocytes and inhibit the ability of leukocytes and
macrophages to respond to mitogens and antigens. Glucocorticoids also decrease the production and release of
proinflammatory cytokines. They inhibit phospholipase A2, which blocks the release of arachidonic acid (the
precursor of the prostaglandins and leukotrienes), resulting in anti-inflammatory actions. Lastly, these agents
influence the inflammatory response by stabilizing mast cell and basophil membranes, thereby decreasing histamine
release.
5.  Affect other systems
High levels of glucocorticoids provide negative feedback to reduce ACTH production and affect the endocrine
system by suppressing synthesis of glucocorticoids and thyroid-stimulating hormone. In addition, adequate cortisol
levels are essential for normal glomerular filtration. Corticosteroids may adversely affect other systems (see Adverse
Effects below).
972
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 973 ---

B.  Mineralocorticoids
Mineralocorticoids help to control fluid status and concentration of electrolytes, especially sodium and potassium.
Aldosterone acts on mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts in the kidney, causing
reabsorption of sodium, bicarbonate, and water. Conversely, aldosterone decreases reabsorption of potassium,
which, with H+, is lost in the urine. Enhancement of sodium reabsorption by aldosterone also occurs in
gastrointestinal mucosa and in sweat and salivary glands. [Note: Elevated aldosterone levels may cause alkalosis and
hypokalemia, retention of sodium and water, and increased blood volume and blood pressure. Hyperaldosteronism is
treated with spironolactone.]

--- PAGE 974 ---

C.  Therapeutic uses of the corticosteroids
Semisynthetic derivatives of corticosteroids vary in anti-inflammatory potency, mineralocorticoid activity, and
duration of action (Figure 26.4). These agents are used in replacement therapy and in the treatment of severe allergic
reactions, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, other inflammatory disorders, and some cancers.
Figure 26.4 Pharmacologic effects and duration of action of some commonly used
natural and synthetic corticosteroids. Activities are all relative to that of hydrocortisone,
which is considered to be 1.
1.  Replacement therapy for primary adrenocortical insufficiency (Addison disease)
Addison disease is caused by adrenal cortex dysfunction (diagnosed by lack of response to ACTH administration).
Hydrocortisone [hye-droe-KOR-tih-sone], which is identical to natural cortisol, is given to correct the deficiency.
Failure to do so results in death. Two-thirds of the daily dosage of hydrocortisone is administered in the morning
and one-third in the afternoon, mimicking the normal diurnal variation in cortisol levels. Administration of
fludrocortisone [floo-droe-KOR-tih-sone], a potent synthetic mineralocorticoid, may also be necessary to correct
mineralocorticoid deficiency.
2.  Replacement therapy for secondary or tertiary adrenocortical insufficiency
These disorders are caused by a defect in CRH production by the hypothalamus or in ACTH production by the
pituitary. Hydrocortisone is used for treatment of these deficiencies.
3.  Diagnosis of Cushing syndrome
Cushing syndrome is caused by hypersecretion of glucocorticoids (hypercortisolism) that results from excessive
release of ACTH by the anterior pituitary or an adrenal tumor. [Note: Chronic treatment with high doses of
glucocorticoids is a frequent cause of iatrogenic Cushing syndrome.] Cortisol levels (urine, plasma, and saliva) and
the dexamethasone [dex-a-METH-a-sone] suppression test are used to diagnose Cushing syndrome. The synthetic
glucocorticoid dexamethasone suppresses cortisol release in normal individuals, but not those with Cushing
syndrome.
4.  Replacement therapy for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)
CAH is a group of diseases resulting from an enzyme defect in the synthesis of one or more of the adrenal steroid
hormones. CAH may lead to virilization in females due to overproduction of adrenal androgens. Treatment requires
administration of sufficient corticosteroids to suppress release of CRH and ACTH and normalize hormone levels.
This decreases production of adrenal androgens. The choice of replacement hormone depends on the specific
enzyme defect.
5.  Relief of inflammatory symptoms
Corticosteroids significantly reduce inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory skin
conditions, including redness, swelling, heat, and tenderness. These agents are important for symptom control in
persistent asthma, as well as treatment of exacerbations of asthma and inflammatory bowel disease. In osteoarthritis,
intraarticular corticosteroids may be used for treatment of a disease flare. Corticosteroids are not curative in these
disorders.974
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 975 ---

6.  Treatment of allergies
Corticosteroids are beneficial in the treatment of allergic rhinitis, as well as drug, serum, and transfusion allergic
reactions. In the treatment of allergic rhinitis and asthma, fluticasone [floo-TIK-a-sone] and others (see Figure 26.5)
are inhaled into the respiratory tract from a metered dose dispenser. This minimizes systemic effects, reducing or
eliminating the use of oral corticosteroids.

intramuscular; IV = intravenous.)
7.  Acceleration of lung maturation
Fetal cortisol is a regulator of lung maturation. Consequently, a regimen of betamethasone or dexamethasone
administered intramuscularly to the mother within 48 hours proceeding premature delivery can accelerate lung
maturation in the fetus and prevent respiratory distress syndrome.
977
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 978 ---

D.  Pharmacokinetics
1.  Absorption and fate
Corticosteroids are readily absorbed after oral administration. Selected compounds may be administered
intravenously, intramuscularly, intra-articularly, topically, or via inhalation or intranasal delivery (Figure 26.5). All
topical and inhaled glucocorticoids are absorbed to some extent and, therefore, have the potential to suppress the
hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. After absorption, glucocorticoids are greater than 90% bound to plasma
proteins, mostly corticosteroid-binding globulin or albumin. Corticosteroids are metabolized by the liver microsomal
oxidizing enzymes. The metabolites are conjugated to glucuronic acid or sulfate and excreted by the kidney. [Note:
The half-life of corticosteroids may increase substantially in hepatic dysfunction.] Prednisone [PRED-nih-sone] is
preferred in pregnancy because it minimizes steroid effects on the fetus. It is a prodrug that is not converted to the
active compound, prednisolone [pred-NIH-so-lone], in the fetal liver. Any prednisolone formed in the mother is
biotransformed to prednisone by placental enzymes.
2.  Dosage
Factors that should be considered in determining the dosage of corticosteroids include glucocorticoid versus
mineralocorticoid activity, duration of action, type of preparation, and time of day when the drug is administered.
When large doses of corticosteroids are required for more than 2 weeks, suppression of the HPA axis occurs.
Alternate-day administration of corticosteroids may prevent this adverse effect by allowing the HPA axis to
recover/function on days the hormone is not taken.
978
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 979 ---

E.  Adverse effects
Common adverse effects of long-term corticosteroid therapy are often dose related (Figure 26.6). For example, in
rheumatoid arthritis, the daily dose of prednisone was the strongest predictor of occurrence of adverse effects
(Figure 26.7). Osteoporosis is the most common adverse effect due to the ability of glucocorticoids to suppress
intestinal Ca2+ absorption, inhibit bone formation, and decrease sex hormone synthesis. Patients are advised to take
calcium and vitamin D supplements. Bisphosphonates may also be useful in the treatment of glucocorticoid-induced
osteoporosis. [Note: Increased appetite is not necessarily an adverse effect. In fact, it is one of the reasons for the use
of prednisone in cancer chemotherapy.] The classic Cushing-like syndrome (redistribution of body fat, puffy face,
hirsutism, and increased appetite) is observed in excess corticosteroid replacement. Cataracts may also occur with
long-term corticosteroid therapy. Hyperglycemia may develop and lead to diabetes mellitus. Diabetic patients should
monitor blood glucose and adjust medications accordingly if taking corticosteroids. Topical therapy can cause skin
atrophy, ecchymosis, and purple striae.

rheumatoid arthritis treated with no or different doses of prednisone.

www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 981 ---

F.  Discontinuation
Sudden discontinuation of these drugs can cause serious consequences if the patient has suppression of the HPA
axis. In this case, abrupt removal of corticosteroids causes acute adrenal insufficiency that can be fatal. This risk,
coupled with the possibility that withdrawal could exacerbate the disease, means that the dose must be tapered
slowly according to individual tolerance. The patient must be monitored carefully.
981
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 982 ---

G.  Inhibitors of adrenocorticoid biosynthesis or function
Several substances are therapeutically useful as inhibitors of the synthesis or function of adrenal steroids:
ketoconazole, spironolactone, and eplerenone.
1.  Ketoconazole
Ketoconazole [kee-toe-KON-ah-zole] is an antifungal agent that strongly inhibits all gonadal and adrenal steroid
hormone synthesis. It is used in the treatment of patients with Cushing syndrome.
2.  Spironolactone
This antihypertensive drug competes for the mineralocorticoid receptor and, thus, inhibits sodium reabsorption in
the kidney. Spironolactone [speer-oh-no-LAK-tone] also antagonizes aldosterone and testosterone synthesis. It is
effective for hyperaldosteronism and hepatic cirrhosis, and is used with other standard therapies for treatment of
heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. It is also useful in the management of hirsutism in women, probably due
to antiandrogen activity on the hair follicle. Adverse effects include hyperkalemia, gynecomastia, menstrual
irregularities, and skin rashes.
3.  Eplerenone
Eplerenone [e-PLER-ih-none] specifically binds to the mineralocorticoid receptor, where it acts as an aldosterone
antagonist. This specificity avoids the adverse effect of gynecomastia that is associated with spironolactone. It is
approved for the treatment of hypertension and for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

Choose the ONE best answer.
Which part of the adrenal gland is correctly paired with the type of substance it secretes?
A.  Adrenal medulla—corticotropin
B.  Zona fasciculata—cortisol
C.  Zona glomerulosa—androgens
D.  Zona reticularis—catecholamines
Correct answer = B. The adrenal medulla secretes catecholamines. Corticotropin is secreted by the anterior
pituitary. The zona glomerulosa secretes aldosterone, and the zona reticularis secretes androgens.
Corticosteroids are useful in the treatment of which of the following disorders?
A.  Cushing syndrome
B.  Diabetes
C.  Hypertension
D.  Inflammatory bowel disease
Correct answer = D. Corticosteroids can increase blood pressure and glucose and are not used in the treatment of
hypertension or diabetes. Cushing syndrome is an excess secretion of glucocorticoids. Dexamethasone may be
used in the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome, but not its treatment. Corticosteroids reduce inflammation and can be
used in the management of inflammatory bowel disease.
Which adverse effect commonly occurs with glucocorticoid therapy?
A.  Glaucoma
B.  Hyperkalemia
C.  Weight loss
D.  Osteoarthritis
Correct answer = A. Glucocorticoid therapy may cause hypokalemia, not hyperkalemia. Glucocorticoids also
cause increased appetite and osteoporosis. Glaucoma is a known potential adverse effect of this class.
Which contributes to osteoporosis with long-term use of glucocorticoids?
A.  Increased excretion of calcium
B.  Inhibition of calcium absorption
C.  Stimulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis
D.  Decreased production of prostaglandins
Correct answer = B. Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is attributed to inhibition of calcium absorption and
bone formation. Increased intake of calcium plus vitamin D and use of bisphosphonates may be indicated.
Glucocorticoids suppress rather than stimulate the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. The decreased
production of prostaglandins does not play a role in bone formation.
A child with severe asthma is treated with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids. Which adverse effect is of
particular concern?
A.  Hypoglycemia
B.  Hirsutism
C.  Growth suppression
D.  Cushing syndrome
Correct answer = C. Corticosteroids may retard bone growth. Chronic use of the medication may lead to growth
suppression, so linear growth should be monitored periodically. Hyperglycemia, not hypoglycemia, is a possible
adverse effect. Hirsutism and Cushing syndrome are unlikely with the dose that the child receives via inhalation.
Which is appropriate for treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia in a child?
A.  Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)
B.  Ketoconazole
C.  Prednisone
D.  Spironolactone
Correct answer = C. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is seen in infancy and childhood. Because cortisol synthesis
is decreased, feedback inhibition of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) formation and release is also
decreased, resulting in enhanced ACTH formation. This in turn leads to increased levels of adrenal androgens
and/or mineralocorticoids. The treatment is to administer a glucocorticoid, such as hydrocortisone (in infants) or
prednisone, which restores the feedback inhibition. The other options are inappropriate.983

26.10A patient with Addison disease treated with hydrocortisone is experiencing dehydration and hyponatremia.
Which drug is best to add to the patient’s therapy?
A.  Dexamethasone
B.  Fludrocortisone
C.  Prednisone
D.  Triamcinolone
Correct answer = B. To combat dehydration and hyponatremia, a corticosteroid with high mineralocorticoid
activity is needed. Fludrocortisone has the greatest mineralocorticoid activity of the agents provided. The other
drugs have little or no mineralocorticoid activity.
Which strategy is effective to minimize development of HPA axis suppression in a patient with rheumatoid
arthritis on long-term high-dose corticosteroid therapy?
A.  Alternate-day administration
B.  Administration via topical or inhalation route when possible
C.  Immediate cessation of the corticosteroid
D.  Administration of two-thirds of the daily dose in the morning and one-third in the afternoon
Correct answer = A. Topical or inhaled corticosteroids may minimize HPA axis suppression, but are unlikely to
be effective in rheumatoid arthritis. Since the patient has been on long-term therapy, a taper would be necessary.
Administration of two-thirds of the dose in the morning and one-third in the afternoon is a strategy to mimic the
normal diurnal variation of cortisol secretion, but it does not prevent suppression of the HPA axis. Alternate-day
administration is beneficial.
Which patient is most likely to have suppression of the HPA axis and require a slow taper of corticosteroid
therapy?
A.  A patient taking 40 mg of prednisone daily for 7 days to treat an asthma exacerbation.
B.  A patient taking 10 mg of prednisone daily for 3 months for rheumatoid arthritis.
C.  A patient using mometasone nasal spray daily for 6 months for allergic rhinitis.
D.  A patient receiving an intraarticular injection of methylprednisolone for osteoarthritis.
Correct answer = B. Suppression of the HPA axis usually occurs with higher doses of corticosteroids when used
for a duration of 2 weeks or more. Although the dose of prednisone is higher in the asthma patient, the duration of
therapy is short, so the risk of HPA axis suppression is lower. The risk of HPA axis suppression is low with
topical therapies like intranasal mometasone and with one-time joint injections.
Which corticosteroid is most appropriate to administer to a woman in preterm labor to accelerate fetal lung
maturation?
A.  Betamethasone
B.  Fludrocortisone
C.  Hydrocortisone
D.  Prednisone
Correct answer = A. A corticosteroid with high glucocorticoid activity is needed to speed fetal lung maturation
prior to delivery. Betamethasone has high glucocorticoid activity and is one of the recommended drugs in this
context. Dexamethasone is the other. Fludrocortisone mainly has mineralocorticoid activity and is not useful in
this situation. Hydrocortisone has much lower glucocorticoid activity. Prednisone has a higher glucocorticoid
activity than hydrocortisone, but the fetus is not able to convert it to prednisolone, the active form.984

I.  Overview
Osteoporosis, Paget disease, and osteomalacia are disorders of the bone. Osteoporosis is characterized by
progressive loss of bone mass and skeletal fragility. Patients with osteoporosis have an increased risk of fractures,
which can cause significant morbidity. Osteoporosis occurs most frequently in postmenopausal women and older
adults of both sexes. Paget disease is a disorder of bone remodeling that results in disorganized bone formation and
enlarged or misshapen bones. Unlike osteoporosis, Paget disease is usually limited to one or a few bones. Patients
may experience bone pain, bone deformities, or fractures. Osteomalacia is softening of the bones that is most often
attributed to vitamin D deficiency. [Note: Osteomalacia in children is referred to as rickets]. As osteoporosis is more
common, drug therapy for osteoporosis is the focus of this chapter (Figure 27.1).
Figure 27.1 Summary of drugs used in the treatment of osteoporosis and other bone
disorders.

II.  Bone Remodeling
Throughout life, bone undergoes continuous remodeling, with about 10% of the skeleton replaced each year. Bone
remodeling serves to remove and replace damaged bone and to maintain calcium homeostasis. Osteoclasts are cells
that break down bone, a process known as bone resorption. Following bone resorption, osteoblasts or bone-building
cells synthesize new bone. Crystals of calcium phosphate known as hydroxyapatite are deposited in the new bone
matrix during the process of bone mineralization. Bone mineralization is essential for bone strength. Lastly, bone
enters a resting phase until remodeling begins again. Bone loss occurs when bone resorption exceeds bone formation
during the remodeling process. Figure 27.2 shows changes in bone morphology seen in osteoporosis.
Figure 27.2 Changes in bone morphology seen in osteoporosis.

--- PAGE 988 ---

III.  Prevention of Osteoporosis
Strategies to reduce bone loss in postmenopausal women include adequate dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D,
weight-bearing exercise, smoking cessation, and avoidance of excessive alcohol intake. Patients with inadequate
dietary intake of calcium should receive calcium supplementation. Calcium carbonate is an inexpensive and
commonly used calcium supplement. It contains 40% elemental calcium and should be taken with meals for best
absorption. Calcium citrate (21% elemental calcium) is better tolerated and may be taken with or without food.
Adverse effects of calcium supplementation include gas and bloating. Calcium may interfere with absorption of iron
preparations, thyroid replacement, and fluoroquinolone and tetracycline antibiotics, and administration of these
drugs should be separated by several hours. Vitamin D is essential for absorption of calcium and bone health, and
older patients are often at risk for vitamin D deficiency. Supplementation with vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol ) or
vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol ) is used for treatment. In addition, patients at risk for osteoporosis should avoid drugs
that increase bone loss such as glucocorticoids (Figure 27.3). [Note: Use of glucocorticoids (for example,
prednisone 5 mg/d or equivalent) for 3 months or more is a significant risk factor for osteoporosis.]

IV.  Treatment of Osteoporosis
Pharmacologic therapy for osteoporosis is warranted in postmenopausal women and men aged 50 years or over who
have a previous osteoporotic fracture, a bone mineral density that is 2.5 standard deviations or more below that of a
healthy young adult, or a low bone mass (osteopenia) with a high probability of future fractures.

A.  Bisphosphonates
Bisphosphonates including alendronate [a-LEND-row-nate], risedronate [rih-SED-row-nate], and zoledronic [zole-
DROE-nick] acid are preferred agents for treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. These bisphosphonates, along
with etidronate [e-TID-row-nate], ibandronate [eye-BAN-dro-nate], pamidronate [pah-MID-row-nate], and
tiludronate [till-UH-droe-nate], comprise an important drug group used for the treatment of bone disorders such as
osteoporosis and Paget disease, as well as for treatment of bone metastases and hypercalcemia of malignancy.
1.  Mechanism of action
Bisphosphonates bind to hydroxyapatite crystals in the bone and decrease osteoclastic bone resorption, resulting in a
small increase in bone mass and a decreased risk of fractures in patients with osteoporosis. The beneficial effects of
alendronate persist over several years of therapy (Figure 27.4), but discontinuation results in a gradual loss of
effects.
Figure 27.4 Effect of alendronate therapy on the bone mineral density of the lumbar
spine.
2.  Pharmacokinetics
The oral bisphosphonates alendronate, risedronate, and ibandronate are dosed on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis
depending on the drug (Figure 27.5). Absorption after oral administration is poor, with less than 1% of the dose
absorbed. Food and other medications significantly interfere with absorption of oral bisphosphonates, and guidelines
for administration should be followed to maximize absorption (Figure 27.5). Bisphosphonates are rapidly cleared
from the plasma, primarily because they avidly bind to hydroxyapatite in the bone. Once bound to bone, they are
cleared over a period of hours to years. Elimination is predominantly via the kidney, and bisphosphonates should be
avoided in severe renal impairment. For patients unable to tolerate oral bisphosphonates, intravenous ibandronate
and zoledronic acid are alternatives.

Figure 27.5 Dosage formulations and instructions for administration of bisphosphonates
for the treatment of osteoporosis. *Frequency of administration for individual agents
varies with dosage, with higher doses administered less frequently.
3.  Adverse effects
These include diarrhea, abdominal pain, and musculoskeletal pain. Alendronate, risedronate, and ibandronate are
associated with esophagitis and esophageal ulcers. To minimize esophageal irritation, patients should remain upright
after taking oral bisphosphonates. Although uncommon, osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femur fractures may
occur with use of bisphosphonates. The risk of atypical fractures seems to increase with long-term use of
bisphosphonates. Therefore, current guidelines recommend a drug holiday for some patients after 5 years of oral
bisphosphonates or 3 years of zoledronic acid. Figure 27.6 shows relative potencies of the bisphosphonates.

B.  Denosumab
Denosumab [den-OH-sue-mab] is a monoclonal antibody that targets receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B
ligand (RANKL) and inhibits osteoclast formation and function. Denosumab is approved for the treatment of
postmenopausal osteoporosis in women at high risk of fracture. It is administered via subcutaneous injection every 6
months. Denosumab is considered a first-line agent for osteoporosis, particularly in patients at higher risk of
fractures. The drug has been associated with an increased risk of infections, dermatological reactions, hypocalcemia,
and rarely, osteonecrosis of the jaw, and atypical fractures.
993

--- PAGE 994 ---

C.  Parathyroid agents
Teriparatide [ter-ih-PAR-a-tide] is a recombinant form of human parathyroid hormone and abaloparatide [a-bal-oh-
PAR-a-tide] is an analog of parathyroid hormone-related peptide. These drugs act as agonists at the parathyroid
hormone receptor, and once-daily subcutaneous administration results in stimulation of osteoblastic activity and
increased bone formation and bone strength. By contrast, other drugs for osteoporosis inhibit bone resorption. These
agents should be reserved for patients at high risk of fractures and those who have failed or cannot tolerate other
osteoporosis therapies. Both drugs have been associated with hypercalcemia, orthostatic hypotension, and an
increased risk of osteosarcoma in rats. Cumulative lifetime use of either agent for more than 2 years is not
recommended.

--- PAGE 995 ---

D.  Selective estrogen receptor modulators
Lower estrogen levels after menopause promote proliferation and activation of osteoclasts, and bone mass can
decline rapidly. Estrogen replacement is effective for the prevention of postmenopausal bone loss. However, since
estrogen may increase the risk of endometrial cancer (when used without a progestin in women with an intact
uterus), breast cancer, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and coronary events, it is no longer recommended as a
preventive therapy for osteoporosis. Raloxifene [rah-LOX-ih-feen] is a selective estrogen receptor modulator
approved for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. It has estrogen-like effects on bone and estrogen
antagonist effects on breast and endometrial tissue. Therefore, raloxifene increases bone density without increasing
the risk of endometrial cancer, and it decreases the risk of invasive breast cancer. Because it has not been shown to
reduce nonvertebral or hip fractures, raloxifene should be used as an alternative to bisphosphonates or denosumab in
the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Adverse effects include hot flashes, leg cramps, and increased risk of
venous thromboembolism.
995

--- PAGE 996 ---

E.  Calcitonin
Salmon calcitonin [cal-SIH-toe-nin] is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in women who are at least 5 years
postmenopausal. The drug reduces bone resorption, but it is less effective than other agents, and is no longer
routinely recommended for the treatment of osteoporosis. A unique property of calcitonin is relief of pain associated
with osteoporotic fracture. Therefore, calcitonin is sometimes prescribed for the short-term treatment of patients
with a recent painful vertebral fracture. The intranasal formulation is most commonly used in osteoporosis, and
adverse effects include rhinitis and other nasal symptoms.

B.  Food or other medications greatly impair absorption of bisphosphonates.
C.  Bisphosphonates are mainly metabolized via the cytochrome P450 system.
D.  Elimination half-life of bisphosphonates ranges from 4 to 6 hours.
Correct answer = B. Food and other medications decrease absorption of bisphosphonates, which are already
poorly absorbed (less than 1%) after oral administration. Bisphosphonates are cleared from the plasma by binding
to bone and being cleared by the kidney (not metabolized by the CYP450 system). The elimination half-life may
be years.
Which agent is administered once yearly to treat osteoporosis?
A.  Abaloparatide
B.  Denosumab
C.  Risedronate
D.  Zoledronic acid
Correct answer = D. Zoledronic acid is administered intravenously once per year. Abaloparatide is a daily
subcutaneous injection. Denosumab is administered every 6 months, and risedronate is administered daily,
weekly, or monthly.
Which osteoporosis medication works by preferentially stimulating activity of osteoblasts?
A.  Denosumab
B.  Ibandronate
C.  Raloxifene
D.  Teriparatide
Correct answer = D. Teriparatide is a parathyroid hormone analog that has anabolic effects on bone through
stimulation of osteoblast activity. The other medications work primarily by inhibiting osteoclast activity
(inhibition of bone resorption).
Which best describes the mechanism of action of denosumab in the treatment of osteoporosis?
A.  Parathyroid hormone analog
B.  RANKL inhibitor
C.  Selective estrogen receptor modulator
D.  Vitamin D analog
Correct answer = B. Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-
B ligand (RANKL) and inhibits osteoclast formation and function.
A 52-year-old woman has a history of rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, hypertension, and heartburn. Her daily
medications include methotrexate, prednisone, metformin, hydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril, and calcium
carbonate as needed for heartburn symptoms. She is worried about the risk of osteoporosis as she approaches
menopause. Which of her medications is most likely to contribute to the risk of developing osteoporosis?
A.  Calcium carbonate
B.  Hydrochlorothiazide
C.  Lisinopril
D.  Prednisone
Correct answer = D. Glucocorticoids (for example, prednisone at a dose of ≥ 5 mg per day for greater than 3
months) are a significant risk factor for osteoporosis. The other medications have not been shown to increase the
risk of osteoporosis, and calcium carbonate and hydrochlorothiazide (diuretic that increases calcium retention)
may be beneficial for patients at risk of osteoporosis.
A 65-year-old woman who has been diagnosed with postmenopausal osteoporosis has no history of fractures
and no other pertinent medical conditions. Which is most appropriate for management of her osteoporosis?
A.  Alendronate
B.  Calcitonin
C.  Denosumab
D.  Raloxifene
Correct answer = A. Bisphosphonates are first-line therapy for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women without
contraindications. Raloxifene is an alternative that may be less efficacious (especially for nonvertebral and hip
fractures), and calcitonin is not recommended. Denosumab is best used for patients at high risk of fractures.997

27.10A 55-year-old woman with postmenopausal osteoporosis has a past medical history of ethanol abuse,
alcoholic liver disease, erosive esophagitis, and hypothyroidism. Which is the primary reason oral
bisphosphonates should be used with caution in this patient?
A.  Age
B.  Erosive esophagitis
C.  Liver disease
D.  Thyroid disease
Correct answer = B. Bisphosphonates are known to cause esophageal irritation and should be used with caution in
a patient with a history of erosive esophagitis. Age is not a factor for consideration in bisphosphonate use. Liver
disease is not a contraindication to bisphosphonate use, since bisphosphonates are mainly cleared via the kidney.
Thyroid disease is not a contraindication to bisphosphonate use, although overaggressive replacement of thyroid
may contribute to osteoporosis.
A 70-year-old woman is being started on ibandronate once monthly for the treatment of osteoporosis. Which
is important to communicate to this patient?
A.  Take this medication with orange juice to increase absorption.
B.  Take this medication after meals to minimize stomach upset.
C.  Remain upright for at least 60 minutes after taking this medication.
D.  Adverse effects may include blood clots and leg cramps.
Correct answer = C. Patients need to remain upright for 60 minutes after ibandronate (30 minutes for other
bisphosphonates). Ibandronate should be given on an empty stomach with plain water only. Bisphosphonates,
unlike raloxifene, are not associated with blood clots and leg cramps.
Use of which agent for osteoporosis should be limited to no more than 2 years?
A.  Calcitonin
B.  Denosumab
C.  Teriparatide
D.  Zoledronic acid
Correct answer = C. Use of the recombinant parathyroid hormone teriparatide should be limited to 2 years. Use
beyond 2 years has not been studied, and is not recommended. The other agents do not have such limitations.
A patient has been taking alendronate for postmenopausal osteoporosis for 5 years with a slight increase in
bone mineral density and no occurrence of fractures. Risk of which adverse effect might warrant
consideration of a drug holiday from alendronate in this patient?
A.  Atypical femur fractures
B.  Esophagitis
C.  Osteosarcoma
D.  Rhinitis
Correct answer = A. Atypical femur fractures are associated with long-term use of bisphosphonates (greater than
5 years). Therefore, a drug holiday might be considered since the patient has had no fractures. Esophagitis, while
a side effect of bisphosphonate therapy, can be prevented with appropriate administration. Osteosarcoma is
associated with the parathyroid hormone analogs, and rhinitis is associated with intranasal calcitonin.998

Principles of Antimicrobial Therapy
Jamie Kisgen
1000
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1001 ---

I.  Overview
Antimicrobial therapy takes advantage of the biochemical differences that exist between microorganisms and human
beings. Antimicrobial drugs are effective in the treatment of infections because of their selective toxicity; that is,
they have the ability to injure or kill an invading microorganism without harming the cells of the host. In most
instances, the selective toxicity is relative rather than absolute, requiring that the concentration of the drug be
carefully controlled to attack the microorganism, while still being tolerated by the host.
1001
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1002 ---

II.  Selection of Antimicrobial Agents
Selection of the most appropriate antimicrobial agent requires knowledge of 1) the identity of the organism, 2) the
susceptibility of the organism to a particular agent, 3) the site of the infection, 4) patient factors, 5) the safety and
efficacy of the agent, and 6) the cost of therapy. However, most patients require empiric therapy (immediate
administration of drug(s) prior to bacterial identification and susceptibility testing).
1002
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1003 ---

A.  Identification of the infecting organism
Characterizing the organism is central to selection of appropriate therapy. A rapid assessment of the nature of the
pathogen can sometimes be made on the basis of the Gram stain, which is particularly useful in identifying the
presence and morphologic features of microorganisms in body fluids that are normally sterile (blood, cerebrospinal
fluid [CSF], pleural fluid, synovial fluid, peritoneal fluid, and urine). However, it is generally necessary to culture
the infective organism to arrive at a conclusive diagnosis and determine the susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.
Thus, it is essential to obtain a sample culture of the organism prior to initiating treatment. Otherwise, it is
impossible to differentiate whether a negative culture is due to the absence of organisms or is a result of
antimicrobial effects of administered antibiotic. Definitive identification of the infecting organism may require other
laboratory techniques, such as detection of microbial antigens, DNA, or RNA, or an inflammatory or host immune
response to the microorganism (Figure 28.1). Newer techniques such as rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry offer accurate, rapid,
and cost-effective identification of the infecting organism(s).

diseases.
1004
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1005 ---

B.  Empiric antimicrobial therapy
Ideally, the antimicrobial agent used to treat an infection is selected after the organism has been identified and its
susceptibility to antimicrobial agents established. However, in the critically ill patient, such a delay could prove
fatal, and immediate empiric therapy is indicated.
1.  Timing
Acutely ill patients with infections of unknown origin—for example, a neutropenic patient (one who is at risk for
infections due to a reduction in neutrophils) or a patient with meningitis (acute inflammation of the membranes
covering the brain and spinal cord)—require immediate treatment. If possible, therapy should be initiated after
specimens for laboratory analysis have been obtained but before the results of the culture and sensitivity are
available.
2.  Selecting a drug
Drug choice in the absence of susceptibility data is influenced by the site of infection, the patient history (for
example, previous infections, age, recent travel history, recent antimicrobial therapy, immune status, whether the
infection was hospital- or community-acquired), and local susceptibility data. Broad-spectrum therapy may be
indicated initially when the organism is unknown or polymicrobial infections are likely. The choice of agent(s) may
also be guided by known association of particular organisms in a given clinical setting. For example, gram-positive
cocci in the spinal fluid of a newborn is unlikely to be Streptococcus pneumoniae and most likely to be
Streptococcus agalactiae  (a group B streptococci), which is sensitive to penicillin G. By contrast, gram-positive
cocci in the spinal fluid of a 40-year-old patient are most likely to be S. pneumoniae . This organism is frequently
resistant to penicillin G and often requires treatment with a high-dose third-generation cephalosporin (such as
ceftriaxone) or vancomycin.
1005

--- PAGE 1006 ---

C.  Determination of antimicrobial susceptibility
After a pathogen is cultured, its susceptibility to specific antibiotics serves as a guide in selection of antimicrobial
therapy. Some pathogens, such as Streptococcus pyogenes  and Neisseria meningitidis , usually have predictable
susceptibility patterns to certain antibiotics. In contrast, most gram-negative bacilli, enterococci, and staphylococcal
species often show unpredictable susceptibility patterns and require susceptibility testing to determine appropriate
antimicrobial therapy. The minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations are used in determining
susceptibility of a drug and can be experimentally determined (Figure 28.2).

Figure 28.2 Determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum
bactericidal concentration (MBC) of an antibiotic.
1.  Bacteriostatic versus bactericidal drugs
Antimicrobial drugs are commonly classified as either bacteriostatic or bactericidal. Historically, bacteriostatic drugs
were thought to only arrest the growth and replication of bacteria at drug levels achievable in the patient, whereas
bactericidal drugs were able to effectively kill ≥99.9% (3-log reduction) within 18 to 24 hours of incubation under
specific laboratory conditions. There is a growing consensus that this classification may be too simplistic, as most
bacteriostatic agents are able to effectively kill organisms; however, they are unable to meet the arbitrary cutoff
value in the bactericidal definition. Figure 28.3 shows a laboratory experiment in which a bactericidal agent is
compared to a bacteriostatic agent and a control. Note that the rate of in vitro killing is greater with bactericidal
agents, but both agents are able to effectively kill the organism. It is also possible for an antibiotic to be
bacteriostatic for one organism and bactericidal for another. For example, linezolid is bacteriostatic against
Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci, but is bactericidal against most strains of S. pneumoniae . In addition, recent
data have demonstrated that bactericidal and bacteriostatic agents have similar efficacy for treating common clinical
infections. In the end, other factors may have a greater impact, including the host immune system, drug
concentration at the site of infection, and underlying severity of the illness.
Figure 28.3 Effects of bactericidal and bacteriostatic drugs on the growth of bacteria in
vitro.
2.  Minimum inhibitory concentration
The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is the lowest antimicrobial concentration that prevents visible growth
of an organism after 24 hours of incubation. This serves as a quantitative measure of in vitro susceptibility and is
commonly used in practice to streamline therapy. Computer automation has improved the accuracy and decreased
the turnaround time for determining MIC results and is the most common approach used by clinical laboratories.
1008
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1009 ---

3.  Minimum bactericidal concentration:
The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) is the lowest concentration of antimicrobial agent that results in a
99.9% decline in colony count after overnight broth dilution incubations (Figure 28.2). [Note: The MBC is rarely
determined in clinical practice due to the time and labor requirements.]

--- PAGE 1010 ---

D.  Effect of the site of infection on therapy: the blood–brain
barrier
Adequate levels of an antibiotic must reach the site of infection for the invading microorganisms to be effectively
eradicated. Capillaries with varying degrees of permeability carry drugs to the body tissues. Natural barriers to drug
delivery are created by the structures of the capillaries of some tissues, such as the prostate, testes, placenta, the
vitreous body of the eye, and the central nervous system (CNS). Of particular significance are the capillaries in the
brain, which help to create and maintain the blood–brain barrier. This barrier is formed by the single layer of
endothelial cells fused by tight junctions that impede entry from the blood to the brain of virtually all molecules,
except those that are small and lipophilic. The penetration and concentration of an antibacterial agent in the CSF are
particularly influenced by the following:
1010
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1011 ---

1.  Lipid solubility
The lipid solubility of a drug is a major determinant of its ability to penetrate the blood–brain barrier. Lipid-soluble
drugs, such as chloramphenicol  and metronidazole, have significant penetration into the CNS, whereas β-lactam
antibiotics, such as penicillin, are ionized at physiologic pH and have low lipid solubility. Therefore, they have
limited penetration through the intact blood–brain barrier under normal circumstances. In infections such as
meningitis in which the brain becomes inflamed, the barrier does not function as effectively, and local permeability
is increased. Some β-lactam antibiotics can enter the CSF in therapeutic amounts when the meninges are inflamed.
1011
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1012 ---

2.  Molecular weight:
A drug with a low molecular weight has an enhanced ability to cross the blood–brain barrier, whereas compounds
with a high molecular weight (for example, vancomycin) penetrate poorly, even in the presence of meningeal
inflammation.
1012
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1013 ---

3.  Protein binding:
A high degree of protein binding of a drug restricts its entry into the CSF. Therefore, the amount of free (unbound)
drug in serum, rather than the total amount of drug present, is important for CSF penetration.
1013
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1014 ---

4.  Susceptibility to transporters or efflux pumps:
Antibiotics that have an affinity for transporter mechanisms or do not have an affinity for efflux pumps have better
CNS penetration.
1014
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1015 ---

E.  Patient factors
In selecting an antibiotic, attention must be paid to the condition of the patient. For example, the status of the
immune system, kidneys, liver, circulation, and age must be considered. In women, pregnancy or breast-feeding also
affects selection of the antimicrobial agent.
1.  Immune system
Elimination of infecting organisms from the body is highly dependent on an intact immune system, and the host
defense system must ultimately eliminate the invading organisms. Alcoholism, diabetes, HIV infection,
malnutrition, autoimmune diseases, pregnancy, advanced age, and immunosuppressive drugs can affect
immunocompetence. High doses of bactericidal agents or longer courses of treatment may be required to eliminate
infective organisms in these individuals.
2.  Renal dysfunction
Poor kidney function may cause accumulation of certain antibiotics. Dosage adjustment prevents drug accumulation
and adverse effects. Serum creatinine levels are frequently used as an index of renal function for adjustment of drug
regimens. However, direct monitoring of serum levels of some antibiotics (for example, vancomycin,
aminoglycosides) is preferred to identify maximum and/or minimum values and prevent potential toxicities. [Note:
The number of functional nephrons decreases with age. Thus, elderly patients are particularly vulnerable to
accumulation of drugs eliminated by the kidneys, even with normal serum creatinine levels.]
3.  Hepatic dysfunction
Antibiotics that are concentrated or eliminated by the liver (for example, erythromycin and doxycycline) must be
used with caution when treating patients with liver dysfunction.
4.  Poor perfusion
Decreased circulation to an anatomic area, such as the lower limbs of a diabetic patient, reduces the amount of
antibiotic that reaches that site of infection, making it more difficult to treat. Decreased perfusion of the
gastrointestinal tract may result in reduced absorption, making attainment of therapeutic concentrations more
difficult with enteral routes.
5.  Age
Renal or hepatic elimination processes are often poorly developed in newborns, making neonates particularly
vulnerable to the toxic effects of agents such as chloramphenicol  and sulfonamides. Young children should not be
treated with tetracyclines or quinolones, which affect bone growth and joints, respectively. Elderly patients may
have decreased renal or liver function, which may alter the pharmacokinetics of certain antibiotics.
6.  Pregnancy and lactation
Many antibiotics cross the placental barrier or enter the nursing infant via the breast milk. Prescribers should consult
the product labeling of an antibiotic to review the risk summary and clinical considerations for use in pregnancy and
lactation. Although the concentration of an antibiotic in fetal circulation or in breast milk is usually low, the total
dose to the infant may be sufficient to produce detrimental effects. For example, congenital abnormalities have been
reported after administration of tetracyclines to pregnant women, and these agents should be generally be avoided in
pregnancy due to the risk to the fetus.
7.  Risk factors for multidrug-resistant organisms
Infections with multidrug-resistant pathogens need broader antibiotic coverage when initiating empiric therapy.
Common risk factors for infection with these pathogens include prior antimicrobial therapy in the preceding 90 days,
hospitalization for greater than 2 days within the preceding 90 days, current hospitalization exceeding 5 days,
admission from a nursing home, high frequency of resistance in the community or local hospital unit (assessed using
hospital antibiograms), and immunosuppressive diseases and/or therapies.

F.  Safety of the agent
Penicillins are among the least toxic of all antimicrobial drugs because they interfere with a site or function unique
to the growth of microorganisms. Other antimicrobial agents (for example, chloramphenicol ) have less specificity
and are reserved for life-threatening infections because of the potential for serious toxicity to the patient. [Note:
Safety is related not only to the inherent nature of the drug but also to the patient factors described above that can
predispose to toxicity.]

G.  Cost of therapy
It is common for several drugs to show similar efficacy in treating an infection but vary widely in cost. For example,
treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) generally includes one of the following:
vancomycin, clindamycin, daptomycin, or linezolid. Although choice of therapy usually centers on the site of
infection, severity of the illness, and ability to take oral medications, it is also important to consider cost of the
medication. Figure 28.4 illustrates the relative cost of commonly used drugs for staphylococcal infections.

--- PAGE 1018 ---

III.  Route of Administration
The oral route of administration is appropriate for mild infections that can be treated on an outpatient basis.
Parenteral administration is used for drugs that are poorly absorbed from the GI tract and for treatment of patients
with serious infections who require maintenance of higher serum concentrations of antimicrobial agents. In
hospitalized patients requiring intravenous (IV) therapy, the switch to oral agents should occur as soon as possible.
Switching patients from IV to oral therapy when clinically stable has been shown to decrease health care costs,
shorten length of stay, and decrease complications from IV catheters. However, some antibiotics, such as
vancomycin and aminoglycosides, are poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and do not achieve
adequate serum levels via oral administration.

--- PAGE 1019 ---

IV.  Determinants of Rational Dosing
Rational dosing of antimicrobial agents is based on pharmacodynamics (the relationship of drug concentrations to
antimicrobial effects) and pharmacokinetic properties (the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of
the drug). Three important properties that have a significant influence on the frequency of dosing are concentration-
dependent killing, time-dependent (concentration-independent) killing, and postantibiotic effect (PAE). Utilizing
these properties to optimize antibiotic dosing regimens can improve clinical outcomes and possibly decrease the
development of resistance.
1019
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1020 ---

A.  Concentration-dependent killing
Certain antimicrobial agents, including aminoglycosides and daptomycin, show a significant increase in the rate of
bacterial killing as the concentration of antibiotic increases from 4- to 64-fold the MIC of the drug for the infecting
organism (Figure 28.5A). Giving drugs that exhibit this concentration-dependent killing by a once-a-day bolus
infusion achieves high peak levels, favoring rapid killing of the infecting pathogen.

units; MIC = minimum inhibitory concentration.

--- PAGE 1023 ---

B.  Time-dependent (concentration-independent) killing
In contrast, β-lactams, glycopeptides, macrolides, clindamycin, and linezolid do not exhibit concentration-dependent
killing (Figure 28.5B ). The clinical efficacy of these antimicrobials is best predicted by the percentage of time that
blood concentrations of a drug remain above the MIC. This effect is sometimes called time-dependent (or
concentration-independent) killing. For example, dosing schedules for the penicillins and cephalosporins that ensure
blood levels greater than the MIC for 50% and 60% of the time, respectively, provide the most clinical efficacy.
Therefore, extended (generally 3 to 4 hours) or continuous (24 hours) infusions can be utilized instead of
intermittent dosing (generally 30 minutes) to achieve prolonged time above the MIC and kill more bacteria. Other
drugs, such as fluoroquinolones and vancomycin, work best by optimizing the ratio of the 24-hour area under the
concentration–time curve to MIC (AUC24/MIC). The AUC24 is the overall exposure of a drug during the dosing
interval and takes into account the concentration as well as the time.
1023

--- PAGE 1024 ---

C.  Postantibiotic effect
The PAE is a persistent suppression of microbial growth that occurs after levels of antibiotic have fallen below the
MIC. Antimicrobial drugs exhibiting a long PAE (for example, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones) often require
only one dose per day, particularly against gram-negative bacteria.

V.  Chemotherapeutic Spectra
In this book, the clinically important bacteria have been organized into eight groups based on Gram stain,
morphology, and biochemical or other characteristics. They are represented as a color-coded list (Figure 28.6A). The
ninth section of the list is labeled “Other,” and it is used to represent any organism not included in one of the other
eight categories. In Figure 28.6B–D, the list is used to illustrate the spectra of bacteria for which a particular class of
antibiotics is therapeutically effective.

--- PAGE 1028 ---

A.  Narrow-spectrum antibiotics
Chemotherapeutic agents acting only on a single or a limited group of microorganisms are said to have a narrow
spectrum. For example, isoniazid is active only against Mycobacterium tuberculosis  (Figure 28.6B ).
1028
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1029 ---

B.  Extended-spectrum antibiotics
Extended spectrum is the term applied to antibiotics that are modified to be effective against gram-positive
organisms and also against a significant number of gram-negative bacteria. For example, ampicillin is considered to
have an extended spectrum because it acts against gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria (Figure 28.6C ).
1029
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1030 ---

C.  Broad-spectrum antibiotics
Drugs such as tetracycline, fluoroquinolones and carbapenems affect a wide variety of microbial species and are
referred to as broad-spectrum antibiotics (Figure 28.6D). Administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics can
drastically alter the nature of the normal bacterial flora and precipitate a superinfection due to organisms such as
Clostridium difficile, the growth of which is normally kept in check by the presence of other colonizing
microorganisms.
1030
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1031 ---

VI.  Combinations of Antimicrobial Drugs
It is therapeutically advisable to treat patients with a single agent that is most specific to the infecting organism. This
strategy reduces the possibility of superinfections, decreases the emergence of resistant organisms, and minimizes
toxicity. However, in some situations, combinations of antimicrobial drugs are advantageous or even required.
1031
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1032 ---

A.  Advantages of drug combinations
Certain combinations of antibiotics, such as β-lactams and aminoglycosides, show synergism; that is, the
combination is more effective than either of the drugs used separately. Because such synergism among antimicrobial
agents is rare, synergistic combinations are only indicated in special situations (for example, in the treatment of
enterococcal endocarditis). Combinations may also be used when an infection is of unknown origin or when there
are organisms with variable sensitivity, such as when treating tuberculosis.
1032
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1033 ---

B.  Disadvantages of drug combinations
A number of antibiotics act only when organisms are multiplying. Thus, coadministration of an agent that causes
bacteriostasis plus a second agent that is bactericidal may result in the first drug interfering with the action of the
second. For example, bacteriostatic tetracycline drugs may interfere with the bactericidal effects of penicillins and
cephalosporins. Another concern is the risk of selection pressure and the development of antibiotic resistance by
giving unnecessary combination therapy.
1033
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1034 ---

VII.  Drug Resistance
Bacteria are considered resistant to an antibiotic if the maximal level of that antibiotic that can be tolerated by the
host does not halt bacterial growth. Some organisms are inherently resistant to an antibiotic. For example, most
gram-negative organisms are inherently resistant to vancomycin. However, microbial species that are normally
responsive to a particular drug may develop more virulent or resistant strains through spontaneous mutation or
acquired resistance and selection. Some of these strains may even become resistant to more than one antibiotic.
1034
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1035 ---

A.  Genetic alterations leading to drug resistance
Acquired antibiotic resistance requires the temporary or permanent gain or alteration of bacterial genetic
information. Resistance develops due to the ability of DNA to undergo spontaneous mutation or to move from one
organism to another (Figure 28.7).
Figure 28.7 Some mechanisms of resistance to antibiotics.
1035
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1036 ---

B.  Altered expression of proteins in drug-resistant organisms
Drug resistance is mediated by a variety of mechanisms, such as an alteration in an antibiotic target site, decreased
penetration of the drug due to lower permeability, increased efflux of the drug, or presence of antibiotic-inactivating
enzymes (Figure 28.7).
1.  Modification of target sites
Alteration of the target site of an antibiotic through mutation can confer resistance to one or more related antibiotics.
For example, S. pneumoniae resistance to β-lactam antibiotics involves alterations in one or more of the major
bacterial penicillin-binding proteins, resulting in decreased binding of the antibiotic to its target.
2.  Decreased accumulation
Decreased uptake or increased efflux of an antibiotic can confer resistance because the drug is unable to attain
access to the site of its action in sufficient concentrations to injure or kill the organism. For example, gram-negative
organisms can limit the penetration of certain agents, including β-lactam antibiotics, as a result of an alteration in the
number and structure of porins (channels) in the outer membrane. Also, the presence of an efflux pump can limit
levels of a drug in an organism, as seen with tetracyclines.
3.  Enzymatic inactivation
The ability to destroy or inactivate the antimicrobial agent can also confer resistance on microorganisms. Examples
of antibiotic-inactivating enzymes include 1) β-lactamases (“penicillinases”) that hydrolytically inactivate the β-
lactam ring of penicillins, cephalosporins, and related drugs; 2) acetyltransferases that transfer an acetyl group to the
antibiotic, inactivating chloramphenicol  or aminoglycosides; and 3) esterases that hydrolyze the lactone ring of
macrolides.

--- PAGE 1037 ---

VIII.  Prophylactic Use of Antibiotics
Certain clinical situations, such as dental procedures and surgeries, require the use of antibiotics for the prevention
rather than for the treatment of infections (Figure 28.8). Because the indiscriminate use of antimicrobial agents can
result in bacterial resistance and superinfection, prophylactic use is restricted to clinical situations in which the
benefits outweigh the potential risks. The duration of prophylaxis should be closely controlled to prevent the
unnecessary development of antibiotic resistance.

--- PAGE 1040 ---

IX.  Complications of Antibiotic Therapy
Even though antibiotics are selectively toxic to an invading organism, the host may still experience adverse effects.
For example, the drug may produce an allergic response or may be toxic in ways unrelated to the antimicrobial
activity.
1040
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1041 ---

A.  Hypersensitivity
Hypersensitivity or immune reactions to antimicrobial drugs or their metabolic products frequently occur. For
example, the penicillins, despite their almost absolute selective microbial toxicity, can cause serious hypersensitivity
problems, ranging from urticaria (hives) to anaphylactic shock. Some reactions may be related to the rate of
infusion, such as “Red man syndrome” seen with rapid infusion of vancomycin. Patients with a documented history
of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis reaction (a severe sloughing of skin and mucus
membranes) to an antibiotic should never be rechallenged, not even for antibiotic desensitization.
1041
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1042 ---

B.  Direct toxicity
High serum levels of certain antibiotics may cause toxicity by directly affecting cellular processes in the host. For
example, aminoglycosides can cause ototoxicity by interfering with membrane function in the auditory hair cells.
Chloramphenicol  can have a direct toxic effect on mitochondria, leading to bone marrow suppression.
Fluoroquinolones can have effects on cartilage and tendons, and tetracyclines have direct effects on bones. A
number of antibiotics can cause photosensitivity.
1042
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1043 ---

C.  Superinfections
Drug therapy, particularly with broad-spectrum antimicrobials or combinations of agents, can lead to alterations of
the normal microbial flora of the upper respiratory, oral, intestinal, and genitourinary tracts, permitting the
overgrowth of opportunistic organisms, especially fungi or resistant bacteria. These infections usually require
secondary treatments using specific anti-infective agents.
1043

--- PAGE 1044 ---

X.  Sites of Antimicrobial Action
Antimicrobial drugs can be classified in a number of ways: 1) by their chemical structure (for example, β-lactams or
aminoglycosides), 2) by their mechanism of action (for example, cell wall synthesis inhibitors), or 3) by their
activity against particular types of organisms (for example, bacteria, fungi, or viruses). Chapters 29 through 31 are
organized by the mechanisms of action of the drug (Figure 28.9), and Chapters 32 through 34 are organized
according to the type of organisms affected by the drug.

Which of the following agents is considered a narrow-spectrum antibiotic?
A.  Ceftriaxone
B.  Ciprofloxacin
C.  Isoniazid
D.  Imipenem
Correct answer = C. Isoniazid is only active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, while ceftriaxone,
ciprofloxacin, and imipenem are considered broad spectrum due to their activity against multiple types of bacteria
and increased risk for contributing to the development of a superinfection.
Which of the following antibiotics exhibits concentration-dependent killing?
A.  Clindamycin
B.  Linezolid
C.  Vancomycin
D.  Daptomycin
Correct answer = D. Clindamycin, linezolid, and vancomycin exhibit time-dependent killing, while daptomycin
works best when administered in a fashion that optimizes concentration-dependent killing.
Which of the following antibiotics exhibits a long postantibiotic effect that permits once-daily dosing?
A.  Gentamicin
B.  Penicillin G
C.  Vancomycin
D.  Aztreonam
Correct answer = A. Aminoglycosides, including gentamicin, possess a long postantibiotic effect, especially when
given as a high dose every 24 hours. Penicillin G, clindamycin, and vancomycin have a relatively short
postantibiotic effect and require dosing that maintains concentrations above the MIC for a longer portion of the
dosing interval.
A 58-year-old man with a history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, and ascites presents with spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis. Which of the following antibiotics requires close monitoring and dosing adjustment in this patient
given his liver disease?
A.  Penicillin G.
B.  Tobramycin.
C.  Erythromycin.
D.  Vancomycin.
Correct answer = C. Erythromycin is metabolized by the liver and should be used with caution in patients with
hepatic impairment. Penicillin G, tobramycin, and vancomycin are primarily eliminated by the kidneys.
JS is a 3-day-old neonate, born at 37 weeks’ gestation, who presents with new onset fever, lethargy, and
decreased desire to feed. Based on JS’s age, which of the following antibiotics is considered safe to use in1045

28.10neonates?
A.  Chloramphenicol
B.  Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim
C.  Tetracycline
D.  Ampicillin
Correct answer = D. Chloramphenicol and sulfonamides (sulfamethoxazole) can cause toxic effects in newborns
due to poorly developed renal and hepatic elimination processes. Tetracycline can have effects on bone growth
and development and should be avoided in newborns and young children. Ampicillin is safe and effective in this
population.
When evaluating drug therapy for meningitis, which of the following factors is expected to have the LEAST
influence on the penetration and concentration of an antibacterial agent in the cerebrospinal fluid?
A.  Lipid solubility of the drug
B.  Minimum inhibitory concentration of the drug
C.  Protein binding of the drug
D.  Molecular weight of the drug
Correct answer = B. Although the minimum inhibitory concentration impacts the effectiveness of the drug against
a given bacteria, it does not affect the ability of a drug to penetrate into the brain. Lipid solubility, protein
binding, and molecular weight all determine the likelihood of a drug to penetrate the blood–brain barrier and
concentrate in the brain.
A 72-year-old male presents with fever, cough, malaise, and shortness of breath. His chest x-ray shows
bilateral infiltrates consistent with pneumonia. Bronchial wash cultures reveal Pseudomonas aeruginosasensitive to cefepime. Which of the following is the best dosing scheme for cefepime based on the drug's
time-dependent bactericidal activity?
A.  1 g every 6 hours given over 30 minutes
B.  2 g every 12 hours given over 3 hours
C.  4 g every 24 hours given over 30 minutes
D.  4 g given as continuous infusion over 24 hours
Correct answer = D. The clinical efficacy of cefepime is based on the percentage of time that the drug
concentration remains above the MIC. A continuous infusion would allow for the greatest amount of time above
the MIC compared to intermittent (30 minutes) and prolonged infusions (3 to 4 hours).
Which of the following adverse drug reactions precludes a patient from being rechallenged with that drug in
the future?
A.  Itching/rash from penicillin
B.  Stevens-Johnson syndrome from sulfamethoxazole–trimethoprim
C.  Gastrointestinal (GI) upset from clarithromycin
D.  Clostridium difficile superinfection from moxifloxacin
Correct answer = B. Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a severe idiosyncratic reaction that can be life threatening, and
these patients should never be rechallenged with the offending agent. Itching/rash is a commonly reported
reaction in patients receiving penicillins but is not life threatening. A patient may be rechallenged if the benefits
outweigh the risk (for example, pregnant patient with syphilis) or the patient could be exposed through a
desensitization procedure. GI upset is a common side effect of clarithromycin but is not due to an allergic
reaction. Moxifloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that can inhibit the normal flora of the GI tract, increasing
the risk for the development of superinfections like C. difficile. This is not an allergic reaction, and the patient can
be rechallenged; however, the patient might be at risk for developing C. difficile  infection again.

--- PAGE 1048 ---

I.  Overview
Some antimicrobial drugs selectively interfere with synthesis of the bacterial cell wall—a structure that mammalian
cells do not possess. The cell wall is composed of a polymer called peptidoglycan that consists of glycan units
joined to each other by peptide cross-links. To be maximally effective, inhibitors of cell wall synthesis require
actively proliferating microorganisms. Figure 29.1 shows the classification of agents affecting cell wall synthesis.

--- PAGE 1051 ---

II.  Penicillins
The basic structure of penicillins consists of a core four-membered β-lactam ring, which is attached to a thiazolidine
ring and an R side chain. Members of this family differ from one another in the R substituent attached to the 6-
aminopenicillanic acid residue (Figure 29.2). The nature of this side chain affects the antimicrobial spectrum,
stability to stomach acid, cross-hypersensitivity, and susceptibility to bacterial degradative enzymes (β-lactamases).
Figure 29.2 Structure of β-lactam antibiotics.
1051
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1052 ---

A.  Mechanism of action
Penicillins interfere with the last step of bacterial cell wall synthesis, which is the cross-linking of adjacent
peptidoglycan strands by a process known as transpeptidation. Since penicillins structurally resemble the terminal
portion of the peptidoglycan strand, they compete for and bind to enzymes called penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs),
which catalyze transpeptidase and facilitate cross-linking of the cell wall (Figure 29.3). The result is the formation of
a weakened cell wall and ultimately cell death. For this reason, penicillins are regarded as bactericidal and work in a
time-dependent fashion.
Figure 29.3 Bacterial cell wall of gram-positive bacteria. NAM = N-acetylmuramic acid;
NAG = N -acetylglucosamine; PEP = cross-linking peptide.
1052
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1053 ---

B.  Antibacterial spectrum
The antibacterial spectrum of the various penicillins is determined, in part, by their ability to cross the bacterial
peptidoglycan cell wall to reach the PBPs in the periplasmic space. Factors determining PBP susceptibility to these
antibiotics include size, charge, and hydrophobicity of the particular β-lactam antibiotic. In general, gram-positive
microorganisms have cell walls that are easily traversed by penicillins, and, therefore, in the absence of resistance,
they are susceptible to these drugs. Gram-negative microorganisms have an outer lipopolysaccharide membrane
surrounding the cell wall that presents a barrier to the water-soluble penicillins. However, gram-negative bacteria
have proteins inserted in the lipopolysaccharide layer that act as water-filled channels (called porins) to permit
transmembrane entry.
1.  Natural penicillins
Penicillin G and penicillin V  are obtained from fermentations of the fungus Penicillium chrysogenum. Penicillin
[pen-i-SILL-in] G (benzylpenicillin) has activity against a variety of gram-positive organisms, gram-negative
organisms, and spirochetes (Figure 29.4). The potency of penicillin G is five to ten times greater than that of
penicillin V  against both Neisseria  spp. and certain anaerobes. Most streptococci are very sensitive to penicillin G,
but penicillin-resistant viridans streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae  isolates are emerging. The vast majority
of Staphylococcus aureus  (greater than 90%) are now penicillinase producing and therefore resistant to penicillin G.
Despite widespread use and increasing resistance in many types of bacteria, penicillin remains the drug of choice for
the treatment of gas gangrene (Clostridium perfringens ) and syphilis (Treponema pallidum ). Penicillin V , only
available in oral formulation, has a spectrum similar to that of penicillin G, but it is not used for treatment of severe
infections because of its limited oral absorption. Penicillin V  is more acid stable than is penicillin G and is the oral
agent employed in the treatment of less severe infections.
Figure 29.4 Typical therapeutic applications of penicillin G. *Resistant strains are
increasingly seen.
2.  Semisynthetic penicillins
Ampicillin [am-pi-SILL-in] and amoxicillin [a-mox-i-SILL-in] (also known as aminopenicillins or extended-
spectrum penicillins) are created by chemically attaching different R groups to the 6-aminopenicillanic acid nucleus.
Addition of R groups extends the gram-negative antimicrobial activity of aminopenicillins to include Haemophilus
influenzae , Escherichia coli,  and Proteus mirabilis  (Figure 29.5A). Ampicillin (with or without the addition of
gentamicin) is the drug of choice for the gram-positive bacillus Listeria monocytogenes  and susceptible enterococcal
species. These extended-spectrum agents are also widely used in the treatment of respiratory infections, and
amoxicillin is employed prophylactically by dentists in high-risk patients for the prevention of bacterial endocarditis.
These drugs are coformulated with β-lactamase inhibitors, such as clavulanic acid or sulbactam, to combat
infections caused by β-lactamase–producing organisms. For example, without the β-lactamase inhibitor, methicillin-
sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) is resistant to ampicillin and amoxicillin. Resistance in the form of
plasmid-mediated penicillinases is a major clinical problem, which limits use of aminopenicillins with some gram-
negative organisms.

3.  Antistaphylococcal penicillins
Methicillin [meth-i-SILL-in], nafcillin [naf-SILL-in], oxacillin [ox-a-SILL-in], and dicloxacillin [dye-klox-a-SILL-
in] are β-lactamase (penicillinase)-resistant penicillins. Their use is restricted to the treatment of infections caused
by penicillinase-producing staphylococci, including MSSA. [Note: Because of its toxicity (interstitial nephritis),
methicillin is not used clinically in the United States except in laboratory tests to identify resistant strains of
Staphylococcus aureus. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) is currently a source of serious
community and nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infections and is resistant to most commercially available β-lactam
antibiotics.] The penicillinase-resistant penicillins have minimal to no activity against gram-negative infections.

4.  Antipseudomonal penicillin
Piperacillin [pip-er-a-SILL-in] is also referred to as an antipseudomonal penicillin because of its activity against
Pseudomonas aeruginosa  (Figure 29.5B ). Formulation of piperacillin with tazobactam extends the antimicrobial
spectrum to include penicillinase-producing organisms (for example, most Enterobacteriaceae and Bacteroides
species). Figure 29.6 summarizes the stability of the penicillins to acid or the action of penicillinase.

C.  Resistance
Survival of bacteria in the presence of β-lactam antibiotics occurs due to the following:
1.  β-Lactamase production
This family of enzymes hydrolyzes the cyclic amide bond of the β-lactam ring, which results in loss of bactericidal
activity (Figure 29.2). They are the major cause of resistance to the penicillins and are an increasing problem. β-
Lactamases either are constitutive, mostly produced by the bacterial chromosome or, more commonly, are acquired
by the transfer of plasmids. Some of the β-lactam antibiotics are poor substrates for β-lactamases and resist
hydrolysis, thus retaining their activity against β-lactamase–producing organisms. [Note: Certain organisms may
have chromosome-associated β-lactamases that are inducible by β-lactam antibiotics (for example, second- and
third-generation cephalosporins).] Gram-positive organisms secrete β-lactamases extracellularly, whereas gram-
negative bacteria inactivate β-lactam drugs in the periplasmic space.
2.  Decreased permeability to the drug
Decreased penetration of the antibiotic through the outer cell membrane of the bacteria prevents the drug from
reaching the target PBPs. In gram-positive bacteria, the peptidoglycan layer is near the surface of the bacteria and
there are few barriers for the drug to reach its target. Reduced penetration of drug into the cell is a greater concern in
gram-negative organisms, which have a complex cell wall that includes aqueous channels called porins. An
excellent example of a pathogen lacking high permeability porins is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The presence of an
efflux pump, which actively removes antibiotics from the site of action, can also reduce the amount of intracellular
drug (for example, Klebsiella pneumoniae).
3.  Altered PBPs
These are bacterial enzymes involved in the synthesis of the cell wall and in the maintenance of morphologic
features of the bacterium. Antibiotic exposure can prevent cell wall synthesis and can lead to morphologic changes
or lysis of susceptible bacteria. The number of PBPs varies with the type of organism. Modified PBPs have a lower
affinity for β-lactam antibiotics, requiring clinically unattainable concentrations of the drug to effect inhibition of
bacterial growth. This explains MRSA resistance to most commercially available β-lactams.

D.  Pharmacokinetics
1.  Administration
The route of administration of a β-lactam antibiotic is determined by the stability of the drug to gastric acid and by
the severity of the infection.
2.  Routes of administration
The combination of ampicillin with sulbactam, piperacillin with tazobactam, and the antistaphylococcal penicillins
nafcillin and oxacillin must be administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM). Penicillin V , amoxicillin,
and dicloxacillin are available only as oral preparations. Others are effective by the oral, IV, or IM routes ( Figure
29.6). [Note: The combination of amoxicillin with clavulanic acid is only available in an oral formulation in the
United States.]
3.  Depot forms
Procaine penicillin G and benzathine penicillin G are administered IM and serve as depot forms. They are slowly
absorbed into the circulation and persist at low levels over a long time period.
4.  Absorption
The acidic environment within the intestinal tract is unfavorable for the absorption of penicillins. In the case of
penicillin V , only one-third of an oral dose is absorbed under the best of conditions. Food decreases the absorption of
the penicillinase-resistant penicillin dicloxacillin because as gastric emptying time increases, the drug is destroyed
by stomach acid. Therefore, it should be taken on an empty stomach. Conversely, amoxicillin is stable in acid and is
readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
5.  Distribution
The β-lactam antibiotics distribute well throughout the body. All the penicillins cross the placental barrier, but none
have been shown to have teratogenic effects. However, penetration into bone or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is
insufficient for therapy unless these sites are inflamed (Figures 29.7 and 29.8). [Note: Inflamed meninges are more
permeable to the penicillins, resulting in an increased ratio of the drug in the CSF compared to the serum.] Penicillin
levels in the prostate are insufficient to be effective against infections.

--- PAGE 1060 ---

Figure 29.8 Enhanced penetration of penicillin into the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) during
inflammation.
6.  Metabolism
Host metabolism of the β-lactam antibiotics is usually insignificant, but some metabolism of penicillin G may occur
in patients with impaired renal function. Nafcillin and oxacillin are exceptions to the rule and are primarily
metabolized in the liver.
7.  Excretion
The primary route of excretion is through the organic acid (tubular) secretory system of the kidney as well as by
glomerular filtration. Patients with impaired renal function must have dosage regimens adjusted. Because nafcillin
and oxacillin are primarily metabolized in the liver, they do not require dose adjustment for renal insufficiency.
Probenecid inhibits the secretion of penicillins by competing for active tubular secretion via the organic acid
transporter and, thus, can increase blood levels. The penicillins are also excreted in breast milk.

E.  Adverse reactions
Penicillins are among the safest drugs. However, adverse reactions may occur (Figure 29.9).

Figure 29.9 Summary of the adverse effects of penicillins.
1062
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1063 ---

1.  Hypersensitivity
Approximately 10% of patients self-report allergy to penicillin. Reactions range from rashes to angioedema (marked
swelling of the lips, tongue, and periorbital area) and anaphylaxis. Cross-allergic reactions occur among the β-
lactam antibiotics. To determine whether treatment with a β-lactam is safe when an allergy is noted, patient history
regarding severity of previous reaction is essential.
2.  Diarrhea
Diarrhea is a common problem that is caused by a disruption of the normal balance of intestinal microorganisms. It
occurs to a greater extent with those agents that are incompletely absorbed and have an extended antibacterial
spectrum. Pseudomembranous colitis from Clostridium difficile and other organisms may occur with penicillin use.
3.  Nephritis
Penicillins, particularly methicillin, have the potential to cause acute interstitial nephritis. [Note: Methicillin is
therefore no longer used clinically.]
4.  Neurotoxicity
The penicillins are irritating to neuronal tissue, and they can provoke seizures if injected intrathecally or if very high
blood levels are reached. Epileptic patients are particularly at risk due to the ability of penicillins to cause
GABAergic inhibition.
5.  Hematologic toxicities
Decreased coagulation may be observed with high doses of piperacillin and nafcillin (and, to some extent, with
penicillin G). Cytopenias have been associated with therapy of greater than 2 weeks, and therefore, blood counts
should be monitored weekly for such patients.

III.  Cephalosporins
The cephalosporins are β-lactam antibiotics closely related both structurally and functionally to penicillins. Most
cephalosporins are produced semisynthetically by the chemical attachment of side chains to 7-aminocephalosporanic
acid. Structural changes on the acyl side chain at the 7-position alter antibacterial activity and variations at the 3-
position modify the pharmacokinetic profile ( Figure 29.10). Cephalosporins have the same mode of action as
penicillins, and they are affected by the same resistance mechanisms. However, they tend to be more resistant than
the penicillins to certain β-lactamases.
Figure 29.10 Structural features of cephalosporin antibiotics.
1064

--- PAGE 1065 ---

A.  Antibacterial spectrum
Cephalosporins have been classified as first, second, third, fourth, and advanced generation, based largely on their
bacterial susceptibility patterns and resistance to β-lactamases (Figure 29.11). [Note: Commercially available
cephalosporins are ineffective against L. monocytogenes, C. difficile , and the enterococci.]

Figure 29.11 Summary of therapeutic applications of cephalosporins. *Methicillin-
resistant staphylococci are resistant. **Cefoxitin and cefotetan have anaerobic coverage.
†Ceftazidime only.
1.  First generation
The first-generation cephalosporins act as penicillin G substitutes. They are resistant to the staphylococcal
penicillinase (that is, they cover MSSA). Isolates of S . pneumoniae  resistant to penicillin are also resistant to first-
generation cephalosporins. Agents in this generation also have modest activity against Proteus mirabilis , E. coli , and
K. pneumoniae . Most oral cavity anaerobes like Peptostreptococcu s are sensitive, but the Bacteroides fragilis  group
is resistant.
2.  Second generation
The second-generation cephalosporins display greater activity against gram-negative organisms, such as H .
influenzae , Klebsiella  species, Proteus  species, Escherichia coli , and Moraxella catarrhalis , whereas activity against
gram-positive organisms is weaker. Antimicrobial coverage of the cephamycins (cefotetan [sef-oh-TEE-tan] and
cefoxitin [sef-OX-i-tin]) also includes anaerobes (for example, Bacteroides fragilis ). They are the only
cephalosporins commercially available with appreciable activity against gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. However,
neither drug is first line because of the increasing prevalence of resistance among B. fragilis .
3.  Third generation
These cephalosporins have assumed an important role in the treatment of infectious diseases. Although they are less
potent than first-generation cephalosporins against MSSA, the third-generation cephalosporins have enhanced
activity against gram-negative bacilli, including β-lactamase producing strains of H. influenzae  and Neisseria
gonorrhoeae . The spectrum of activity of this class includes enteric organisms, such as Serratia marcescens  and
Providencia  species. Ceftriaxone [sef-trye-AKS-own] and cefotaxime [sef-oh-TAKS-eem] have become agents of
choice in the treatment of meningitis. Ceftazidime [sef-TA-zi-deem] has activity against P. aeruginosa ; however,
resistance is increasing and use should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Third-generation cephalosporins must
be used with caution, as they are associated with significant “collateral damage,” including the induction of
antimicrobial resistance and development of Clostridium difficile infection. [Note: Fluoroquinolone use is also
associated with collateral damage.]
4.  Fourth generation
Cefepime [SEF-eh-peem] is classified as a fourth-generation cephalosporin and must be administered parenterally.
Cefepime has a wide antibacterial spectrum, with activity against streptococci and staphylococci (but only those that
are methicillin susceptible). Cefepime is also effective against aerobic gram-negative organisms, such as
Enterobacter species, E . coli, K . pneumoniae, P . mirabilis , and P . aeruginosa . When selecting an antibiotic that is
active against P . aeruginosa , clinicians should refer to their local antibiograms (laboratory testing for the sensitivity
of an isolated bacterial strain to different antibiotics) for direction.
5.  Advanced generation
Ceftaroline [sef-TAR-oh-leen] is a broad-spectrum, advanced-generation cephalosporin. It is the only β-lactam in
the United States with activity against MRSA, and it is indicated for the treatment of complicated skin and skin
structure infections and community-acquired pneumonia. The unique structure allows ceftaroline to bind to PBPs
found in MRSA and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. In addition to its broad gram-positive activity, it
also has similar gram-negative activity to the third-generation cephalosporin ceftriaxone. Important gaps in coverage
include P . aeruginosa , extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, and Acinetobacter
baumannii . The twice-daily dosing regimen also limits use outside of an institutional setting.
1067
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1068 ---

B.  Resistance
Resistance to the cephalosporins is either due to the hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring by β-lactamases or reduced
affinity for PBPs.
1068
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1069 ---

C.  Pharmacokinetics
1.  Administration
Many of the cephalosporins must be administered IV or IM (Figure 29.12) because of their poor oral absorption.
Exceptions are noted in Figure 29.13.
Figure 29.12 Administration and fate of the cephalosporins. CSF = cerebrospinal fluid.

Drugs that can be administered orally are shown in reverse type. More useful drugs
shown in bold.]. CSF = cerebrospinal fluid; MRSA = methicillin-resistant Staphylococcusaureus .
2.  Distribution
All cephalosporins distribute very well into body fluids. However, adequate therapeutic levels in the CSF, regardless
of inflammation, are achieved with only a few cephalosporins. For example, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime are effective
in the treatment of neonatal and childhood meningitis caused by H. influenzae . Cefazolin [se-FA-zo-lin] is
commonly used for surgical prophylaxis due to its activity against penicillinase-producing S . aureus , along with its
good tissue and fluid penetration.
3.  Elimination
Cephalosporins are eliminated through tubular secretion and/or glomerular filtration ( Figure 29.12). Therefore,
doses must be adjusted in renal dysfunction to guard against accumulation and toxicity. One exception is
ceftriaxone, which is excreted through the bile into the feces and, therefore, is frequently employed in patients with
renal insufficiency.
1070
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1071 ---

D.  Adverse effects
Like the penicillins, the cephalosporins are generally well tolerated. However, allergic reactions are a concern.
Patients who have had an anaphylactic response, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal necrolysis to
penicillins should not receive cephalosporins. Cephalosporins should be avoided or used with caution in individuals
with penicillin allergy. Current data suggest that the cross-reactivity between penicillin and cephalosporins is around
3% to 5% and is determined by the similarity in the side chain, not the β-lactam structure. The highest rate of
allergic cross-sensitivity is between penicillin and first-generation cephalosporins.

IV.  Other β-Lactam Antibiotics
1072
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1073 ---

A.  Carbapenems
Carbapenems are synthetic β-lactam antibiotics that differ in structure from the penicillins in that the sulfur atom of
the thiazolidine ring (Figure 29.2) has been externalized and replaced by a carbon atom ( Figure 29.14). Imipenem [i-
mi-PEN-em], meropenem [mer-oh-PEN-em], doripenem [dore-i-PEN-em], and ertapenem [er-ta-PEN-em] are drugs
in this group.
Figure 29.14 Structural features of imipenem and aztreonam.
1.  Antibacterial spectrum
Imipenem resists hydrolysis by most β-lactamases, but not the metallo-β-lactamases. This drug plays a role in
empiric therapy because it is active against β-lactamase–producing gram-positive and gram-negative organisms,
anaerobes, and P. aeruginosa  (Figure 29.15). Meropenem and doripenem have antibacterial activity similar to that of
imipenem. Doripenem may retain activity against resistant isolates of Pseudomonas . Unlike other carbapenems,
ertapenem lacks coverage against P . aeruginosa, Enterococcus  species, and Acinetobacter  species.

1074
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1075 ---

Imipenem, meropenem, and doripenem are administered IV and penetrate well into body tissues and fluids,
including the CSF when the meninges are inflamed. Meropenem is known to reach therapeutic levels in bacterial
meningitis even without inflammation. These agents are excreted by glomerular filtration. Imipenem undergoes
cleavage by a dehydropeptidase found in the brush border of the proximal renal tubule. Compounding imipenem
with cilastatin protects the parent drug from renal dehydropeptidase and, thus, prolongs its activity in the body. The
other carbapenems do not require coadministration of cilastatin. Ertapenem is administered IV once daily. [Note:
Doses of these agents must be adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency.]
3.  Adverse effects
Imipenem/ cilastatin can cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Eosinophilia and neutropenia are less common than
with other β-lactams. High levels of imipenem may provoke seizures; however, the other carbapenems are less likely
to do so. Carbapenems and penicillin share a common bicyclic core. Structural similarity may confer cross-reactivity
between classes. While those with true penicillin allergy should use carbapenems cautiously, the cross-reactivity rate
seen in studies is very low (less than 1%).
1075
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1076 ---

B.  Monobactams
The monobactams, which also disrupt bacterial cell wall synthesis, are unique because the β-lactam ring is not fused
to another ring ( Figure 29.14). Aztreonam [az-TREE-oh-nam], which is the only commercially available
monobactam, has antimicrobial activity directed primarily against gram-negative pathogens, including the
Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa . It lacks activity against gram-positive organisms and anaerobes. Aztreonam is
administered either IV or IM and can accumulate in patients with renal failure. Aztreonam is relatively nontoxic, but
it may cause phlebitis, skin rash, and, occasionally, abnormal liver function tests. This drug has a low immunogenic
potential, and it shows little cross-reactivity with antibodies induced by other β-lactams. Thus, this drug may offer a
safe alternative for treating patients who are allergic to other penicillins, cephalosporins, or carbapenems.
1076

--- PAGE 1077 ---

V.  β-Lactamase Inhibitors
Hydrolysis of the β-lactam ring, either by enzymatic cleavage with a β-lactamase or by acid, destroys the
antimicrobial activity of a β-lactam antibiotic. β-Lactamase inhibitors, such as clavulanic [cla-vue-LAN-ick] acid,
sulbactam [sul-BACK-tam], and tazobactam [ta-zoh-BACK-tam], contain a β-lactam ring but, by themselves, do not
have significant antibacterial activity or cause any significant adverse effects. Avibactam [av-ee-BACK-tam] and
vaborbactam [vay-bor-BACK-tam] are also β-lactamase inhibitors; however, their structures lack the core β-lactam
ring. β-Lactamase inhibitors function by inactivating β-lactamases, thereby protecting the antibiotics that are
normally substrates for these enzymes. The β-lactamase inhibitors are, therefore, formulated in combination with β-
lactamase–sensitive antibiotics, such as amoxicillin, ampicillin, and piperacillin (Figure 29.1). Figure 29.16 shows
the effect of clavulanic acid and amoxicillin on the growth of β-lactamase–producing E. coli . [Note: Clavulanic acid
is nearly devoid of any antibacterial activity.]

and without clavulanic acid.

A.  Cephalosporin and β-lactamase inhibitor combinations
Ceftolozane [sef-TOL-oh-zane] is a third-generation cephalosporin combined with the β-lactamase inhibitor,
tazobactam. Ceftolozane-tazobactam is available only in an IV formulation. Its niche for use is in the treatment of
resistant Enterobacteriaceae and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Ceftolozane-tazobactam has activity
against some β-lactamase–producing bacteria (for example, select strains of ESBLs). This combination has narrow
gram-positive and very limited anaerobic activity. Ceftazidime, a third-generation cephalosporin is combined with
the β-lactamase inhibitor avibactam [AV-i-BAK-tam]. Ceftazidime-avibactam, available only in IV formulation, has
broad gram-negative activity including Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa . Addition of avibactam allows the drug
to resist hydrolysis against broad spectrum β-lactamases (AmpC, ESBL, carbapenemases) with the exception of
metallo-β-lactamases. Ceftazidime-avibactam has minimal activity against Acinetobacter as well as anaerobic and
gram-positive organisms. Both of these combinations are indicated for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections
(in combination with metronidazole) and for the management of complicated urinary tract infections. Given the
extensive antimicrobial activity, ceftolozane–tazobactam and ceftazidime–avibactam are reserved for the treatment
of infections due to multidrug-resistant pathogens.

--- PAGE 1079 ---

B.  Carbapenem/β-lactamase inhibitor combination
Meropenem-vaborbactam is a combination of a carbapenem and a β-lactamase inhibitor. It is approved for the
treatment of complicated urinary tract infections including pyelonephritis. This combination agent has activity
against Enterobacteriaceae producing a broad spectrum of β-lactamases, except metallo-β-lactamases.
1079

--- PAGE 1080 ---

VI.  Vancomycin
Vancomycin [van-koe-MYE-sin] is a tricyclic glycopeptide active against aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive
bacteria, including MRSA, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis  (MRSE), Enterococcus  spp., and
Clostridium difficile  (Figure 29.17). Following cell entry, it binds to peptidoglycan precursors, disrupting
polymerization and cross-linking required for maintenance of cell wall integrity. This interaction results in
bactericidal activity. Due to an increase in MRSA, vancomycin is commonly used in patients with skin and soft
tissue infections, infective endocarditis, and nosocomial pneumonia. Frequency of administration is dependent on
renal function. Therefore, monitoring of creatinine clearance is required to optimize exposure and minimize toxicity.
Optimal cure rates are observed when trough concentrations are maintained between 10 and 20 mcg/mL. [Note: The
area under the curve/minimum inhibitory concentration ratio (AUC/MIC) is the best predictor of vancomycin
activity against S. aureus , with an AUC/MIC of greater than or equal to 400 associated with treatment success.]
Initial trough concentrations are attained prior to the fourth or fifth vancomycin dose to ensure appropriate dosing.
Common adverse events include nephrotoxicity, infusion-related reactions (red man syndrome and phlebitis), and
ototoxicity. Emergence of resistance is uncommon within Streptococcus and Staphylococcus  spp., but frequently
observed in Enterococcus faecium  infections. Resistance is driven by alterations in binding affinity to peptidoglycan
precursors. Due to the prevalence of resistance, prudent use of vancomycin is warranted. Lastly, vancomycin has
poor absorption after oral administration, so use of the oral formulation is limited to the management of Clostridium
difficile  infection in the colon.

strains. **Oral vancomycin only for C. difficile .

VII.  Lipoglycopeptides
Telavancin [tel-a-VAN-sin], oritavancin [or-IT-a-VAN-sin], and dalbavancin [dal-ba-VAN-sin] are bactericidal
concentration-dependent semisynthetic lipoglycopeptide antibiotics with activity against gram-positive bacteria. The
lipoglycopeptides maintain a spectrum of activity similar to vancomycin, affecting primarily staphylococci,
streptococci, and enterococci. Because of structural differences, they are more potent than vancomycin and may have
activity against vancomycin-resistant isolates. Like vancomycin, these agents inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis.
The lipid tail is essential in anchoring the drug to the cell walls to improve target site binding. Additionally,
telavancin and oritavancin disrupt membrane potential. In combination, these actions improve activity and minimize
selection of resistance. Telavancin is considered an alternative to vancomycin in treating acute bacterial skin and
skin structure infections (ABSSSIs) and hospital-acquired pneumonia caused by resistant gram-positive organisms,
including MRSA. The use of telavancin in clinical practice may be limited by its adverse effect profile, which
includes nephrotoxicity, risk of fetal harm, and interactions with medications known to prolong the QTc interval (for
example, fluoroquinolones, macrolides). Prior to initiation, assessment of renal function, pregnancy status, and
current medications is needed to ensure safe administration.
In contrast to telavancin, oritavancin and dalbavancin have prolonged half-lives (245 and 187 hours,
respectively), allowing for single-dose administration for the management of ABSSSI. Stable patients with ABSSSI
may be treated as outpatients, eliminating the need for inpatient admission, central catheter placement, and/or daily
outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy. Consistent with other glycopeptides, infusion-related reactions may occur.
Oritavancin and telavancin are known to interfere with phospholipid reagents used in assessing coagulation.
Alternative therapy should be considered with concomitant heparin use.

VIII.  Daptomycin
Daptomycin [DAP-toe-mye-sin] is a bactericidal concentration-dependent cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic that is an
alternative to other agents, such as vancomycin or linezolid, for treating infections caused by resistant gram-positive
organisms, including MRSA and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) (Figure 29.18). Daptomycin is indicated
for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections and bacteremia caused by S . aureus , including
those with right-sided infective endocarditis. Efficacy of treatment with daptomycin in left-sided endocarditis has
not been demonstrated. Additionally, daptomycin is inactivated by pulmonary surfactants; thus, it should never be
used in the treatment of pneumonia. Daptomycin is dosed IV once daily. Figure 29.19 provides a comparison of
important characteristics of vancomycin, daptomycin, and lipoglycopeptides.

IX.  Fosfomycin
Fosfomycin [fos-foe-MYE-sin] is a bactericidal synthetic derivative of phosphonic acid. It blocks cell wall synthesis
by inhibiting the enzyme enolpyruvyl transferase, a key step in peptidoglycan synthesis. It is indicated for urinary
tract infections caused by E. coli  or E . faecalis  and is considered first-line therapy for acute cystitis. Due to its
unique structure and mechanism of action, cross-resistance with other antimicrobial agents is unlikely. Fosfomycin
is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and distributes well to the kidneys, bladder, and prostate. The drug is
excreted in its active form in the urine and maintains high concentrations over several days, allowing for a one-time
dose. [Note: A parenteral formulation is available in select countries and has been used for the treatment of systemic
infections.] The most commonly reported adverse effects include diarrhea, vaginitis, nausea, and headache.
1084

--- PAGE 1085 ---

X.  Polymyxins
The polymyxins are cation polypeptides that bind to phospholipids on the bacterial cell membrane of gram-negative
bacteria. They have a detergent-like effect that disrupts cell membrane integrity, leading to leakage of cellular
components and cell death. Polymyxins are concentration-dependent bactericidal agents with activity against most
clinically important gram-negative bacteria, including P. aeruginosa , E. coli , K. pneumoniae , Acinetobacter  spp.,
and Enterobacter  spp. However, alterations in the cell membrane, lipid polysaccharides allow many species of
Proteus  and Serratia  to be intrinsically resistant. Only two forms of polymyxin are in clinical use today, polymyxin B
and colistin (polymyxin E ). Polymyxin B  is available in parenteral, ophthalmic, otic, and topical preparations.
Colistin is only available as a prodrug, colistimethate sodium, which is administered IV or inhaled via a nebulizer.
The use of these drugs has been limited due to the increased risk of nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity (for example,
slurred speech, muscle weakness) when used systemically. However, with increasing gram-negative resistance, they
are now commonly used as salvage therapy for patients with multidrug-resistant infections. Careful dosing and
monitoring of adverse effects are important to maximize the safety and efficacy of these agents.

29.6Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
A 45-year-old man presented to the hospital 3 days ago with severe cellulitis and a large abscess on his left
leg. Incision and drainage were performed on the abscess, and cultures revealed methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus. Which is the most appropriate treatment option for once-daily outpatient intravenous
therapy in this patient?
A.  Ertapenem
B.  Ceftaroline
C.  Daptomycin
D.  Piperacillin/tazobactam
Correct answer = C. Daptomycin is approved for skin and skin structure infections caused by MRSA and is given
once daily. A and D are incorrect because they do not cover MRSA. Ceftaroline covers MRSA, but it must be
given twice daily.
Which of the following adverse effects is associated with daptomycin?
A.  Ototoxicity
B.  Red man syndrome
C.  QTc prolongation
D.  Rhabdomyolysis
Correct answer = D. Ototoxicity and red man syndrome are associated with vancomycin. QTc prolongation is
associated with telavancin. Myalgias and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with daptomycin therapy and
require patient education and monitoring.
A 72-year-old man is admitted to the hospital from a nursing home with severe pneumonia. He was
discharged from the hospital 1 week ago after open heart surgery. The patient has no known allergies. Which
of the following regimens is most appropriate for empiric coverage of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcusaureus  and Pseudomonas aeruginosa  in this patient?
A.  Vancomycin + cefepime + ciprofloxacin
B.  Vancomycin + cefazolin + ciprofloxacin
C.  Telavancin + cefepime + ciprofloxacin
D.  Daptomycin + cefepime + ciprofloxacin
Correct answer = A. Vancomycin provides adequate coverage against MRSA, and cefepime and ciprofloxacin
provide adequate empiric coverage of Pseudomonas. B is incorrect because cefazolin does not have activity
against Pseudomonas . C is incorrect because telavancin should be avoided if possible with drugs that prolong the
QTc interval, in this case ciprofloxacin. Daptomycin is inactivated by pulmonary surfactant and should not be
used for pneumonia.
A 23-year-old man presents with acute appendicitis that ruptures shortly after admission. He is taken to the
operating room for surgery, and postsurgical cultures reveal Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis ,
susceptibilities pending. Which of the following provides adequate empiric coverage of these two
pathogens?
A.  Cefepime
B.  Piperacillin/tazobactam
C.  Aztreonam
D.  Ceftaroline
Correct answer = B. While all of these agents cover most strains of E. coli, piperacillin/tazobactam is the only
drug on this list that provides coverage against Bacteroides  species.
A 68-year-old man presents from a nursing home with fever, increased urinary frequency and urgency, and
mental status changes. He has a penicillin allergy of anaphylaxis. Which of the following β-lactams is the
most appropriate choice for gram-negative coverage of this patient’s urinary tract infection?
A.  Cefepime
B.  Ertapenem
C.  Aztreonam
D.  Ceftaroline
Correct answer = C. Based on the severity of the allergic reaction, aztreonam is the choice of all the β-lactams.
Although cross-reactivity with cephalosporins and carbapenems is low, the risk rarely outweighs the benefit in
these cases.
A 25-year-old man presents to the urgent care center with a painless sore on his genitals that started 2 weeks
ago. He reports unprotected sex with a new partner about a month ago. A blood test confirms the patient has1086

29.10Treponema pallidum . Which is the drug of choice for the treatment of this patient's infection as a single
dose?
A.  Benzathine penicillin G
B.  Ceftriaxone
C.  Aztreonam
D.  Vancomycin
Correct answer = A. A single treatment with penicillin is curative for primary and secondary syphilis. No
antibiotic resistance has been reported, and it remains the drug of choice unless the patient has a severe allergic
reaction.
A 20-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with headache, stiff neck, and fever for 2 days and is
diagnosed with meningitis. Which is the best agent for the treatment of meningitis in this patient?
A.  Cefazolin
B.  Cefdinir
C.  Cefotaxime
D.  Cefuroxime axetil
Correct answer = C. Cefotaxime is the only drug on this list with adequate CSF penetration to treat meningitis.
Cefdinir and cefuroxime axetil are only available orally, and cefazolin’s CSF penetration and spectrum of
coverage against S. pneumoniae  are likely inadequate to treat meningitis.
Which of the following cephalosporins has activity against gram-negative anaerobic pathogens like
Bacteroides fragilis?
A.  Cefoxitin
B.  Cefepime
C.  Ceftriaxone
D.  Cefazolin
Correct answer = A. The cephamycins (cefoxitin and cefotetan) are the only cephalosporins with in vitro activity
against anaerobic gram-negative pathogens. Cefepime, ceftriaxone, and cefazolin have no appreciable activity
against Bacteroides fragilis.
In which of the following cases would it be appropriate to use telavancin?
A.  A 29-year-old pregnant woman with ventilator-associated pneumonia
B.  A 76-year-old man with hospital-acquired pneumonia also receiving amiodarone for atrial fibrillation
C.  A 36-year-old man with cellulitis and abscess growing MRSA
D.  A 72-year-old woman with a diabetic foot infection growing MRSA who has moderate renal dysfunction
Correct answer = C. A is not a good option due to the potential of telavancin harming the fetus. Option B is not a
good choice because the patient is on amiodarone, and telavancin can cause QTc prolongation. Option D is not an
appropriate choice because the patient has baseline renal dysfunction and telavancin should be avoided unless
benefit outweighs the risk. Option C is the best choice since telavancin is approved for skin and skin structure
infections, and the patient has no apparent contraindication.
An 18-year-old woman presents to the urgent care clinic with symptoms of a urinary tract infection. Cultures
reveal Enterococcus faecalis that is pan sensitive. Which of the following is an appropriate oral option to
treat the urinary tract infection in this patient?
A.  Cephalexin
B.  Vancomycin
C.  Cefdinir
D.  Amoxicillin
Correct answer = D. Option A and C are incorrect because enterococci are inherently resistant to all
cephalosporins. Option B is incorrect because oral vancomycin is not absorbed and would not reach the urinary
tract in sufficient quantities to treat a urinary tract infection. Option D is the best choice, as amoxicillin is well
absorbed orally and concentrates in the urine.

Protein Synthesis Inhibitors
Jacqueline Jourjy
1088
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1089 ---

I.  Overview
A number of antibiotics exert their antimicrobial effects by targeting bacterial ribosomes and inhibiting bacterial
protein synthesis. Most of these agents exhibit bacteriostatic activity. Bacterial ribosomes differ structurally from
mammalian cytoplasmic ribosomes and are composed of 30S and 50S subunits (mammalian ribosomes have 40S
and 60S subunits). In general, selectivity for bacterial ribosomes minimizes potential adverse consequences
encountered with the disruption of protein synthesis in mammalian host cells. However, high concentrations of
drugs such as chloramphenicol  or the tetracyclines may cause toxic effects as a result of interaction with
mitochondrial mammalian ribosomes, because the structure of mitochondrial ribosomes more closely resembles
bacterial ribosomes. Figure 30.1 summarizes the antimicrobial protein synthesis inhibitors discussed in this chapter.

--- PAGE 1092 ---

II.  Tetracyclines
Tetracyclines consist of four fused rings with a system of conjugated double bonds. Substitutions on these rings alter
the individual pharmacokinetics and spectrum of antimicrobial activity.
1092
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1093 ---

A.  Mechanism of action
Tetracyclines enter susceptible organisms via passive diffusion and by an energy-dependent transport protein
mechanism unique to the bacterial inner cytoplasmic membrane. Tetracyclines concentrate intracellularly in
susceptible organisms. The drugs bind reversibly to the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome. This action prevents
binding of tRNA to the mRNA–ribosome complex, thereby inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis (Figure 30.2).
Figure 30.2 Mechanisms of action of the various protein synthesis inhibitors. aa = amino
acid.
1093
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1094 ---

B.  Antibacterial spectrum
The tetracyclines are bacteriostatic antibiotics effective against a wide variety of organisms, including gram-positive
and gram-negative bacteria, protozoa, spirochetes, mycobacteria, and atypical species. They are commonly used in
the treatment of acne and Chlamydia infections (Figure 30.3).
Figure 30.3 Typical therapeutic applications of tetracyclines. *A tetracycline +
gentamicin.
1094
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1095 ---

C.  Resistance
The most commonly encountered naturally occurring resistance to tetracyclines is an efflux pump that expels drug
out of the cell, thus preventing intracellular accumulation. Other mechanisms of bacterial resistance to tetracyclines
include enzymatic inactivation of the drug and production of bacterial proteins that prevent tetracyclines from
binding to the ribosome. Resistance to one tetracycline does not confer universal resistance to all tetracyclines, and
the development of cross-resistance may be dependent on the mechanism of resistance.
1095
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1096 ---

D.  Pharmacokinetics
1.  Absorption
Tetracyclines are adequately absorbed after oral ingestion ( Figure 30.4). Administration with dairy products or other
substances that contain divalent and trivalent cations (for example, magnesium, calcium and aluminum antacids, or
iron supplements) decreases absorption, particularly for tetracycline [tet-rah-SYE-kleen], due to the formation of
nonabsorbable chelates (Figure 30.5). Both doxycycline [dox-i-SYE-kleen] and minocycline [min-oh-SYE-kleen] are
available as oral and intravenous (IV) preparations.
Figure 30.4 Administration and fate of tetracyclines. CSF = cerebrospinal fluid.
1096
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1097 ---

Figure 30.5 Effect of antacids and milk on the absorption of tetracyclines.
2.  Distribution
The tetracyclines concentrate well in the bile, liver, kidney, gingival fluid, and skin. Moreover, they bind to tissues
undergoing calcification (for example, teeth and bones) or to tumors that have high calcium content. Penetration into
most body fluids is adequate. Only minocycline and doxycycline achieve therapeutic levels in the cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF). Minocycline also achieves high concentrations in saliva and tears, rendering it useful in eradicating the
meningococcal carrier state. All tetracyclines cross the placental barrier and concentrate in fetal bones and dentition.
3.  Elimination
Tetracycline is primarily eliminated unchanged in the urine, whereas minocycline undergoes hepatic metabolism and
is eliminated to a lesser extent via the kidney. Doxycycline is preferred in patients with renal dysfunction, as it is
primarily eliminated via the bile into the feces.
1097
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1098 ---

E.  Adverse effects
1.  Gastric discomfort
Epigastric distress commonly results from irritation of the gastric mucosa (Figure 30.6) and is often responsible for
noncompliance with tetracyclines. Esophagitis may be minimized through coadministration with food (other than
dairy products) or fluids and the use of capsules rather than tablets. [Note: Tetracycline should be taken on an empty
stomach.]
Figure 30.6 Some adverse effects of tetracyclines. GI = gastrointestinal.
2.  Effects on calcified tissues
Deposition in the bone and primary dentition occurs during the calcification process in growing children. This may
cause discoloration and hypoplasia of teeth and a temporary stunting of growth. For this reason, the use of
1098
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1099 ---

tetracyclines is limited in pediatrics.
3.  Hepatotoxicity
Rarely hepatotoxicity may occur with high doses, particularly in pregnant women and those with preexisting hepatic
dysfunction or renal impairment.
4.  Phototoxicity
Severe sunburn may occur in patients receiving a tetracycline who are exposed to sun or ultraviolet rays. This
toxicity is encountered with any tetracycline, but more frequently with tetracycline and demeclocycline [dem-e-kloe-
SYE-kleen]. Patients should be advised to wear adequate sun protection.
5.  Vestibular dysfunction
Dizziness, vertigo, and tinnitus may occur particularly with minocycline, which concentrates in the endolymph of
the ear and affects function.
6.  Pseudotumor cerebri
Benign, intracranial hypertension characterized by headache and blurred vision may occur rarely in adults. Although
discontinuation of the drug reverses this condition, it is not clear whether permanent sequelae may occur.
7.  Contraindications
The tetracyclines should not be used in pregnant or breast-feeding women or in children less than 8 years of age.
1099

--- PAGE 1100 ---

III.  Glycylcyclines
Tigecycline [tye-ge-SYE-kleen], a derivative of minocycline, is the first member of the glycylcycline antimicrobial
class. It is indicated for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections, complicated intra-abdominal
infections, and community-acquired pneumonia.
1100
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1101 ---

A.  Mechanism of action
Tigecycline exhibits bacteriostatic action by reversibly binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit and inhibiting bacterial
protein synthesis.
1101
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1102 ---

B.  Antibacterial spectrum
Tigecycline exhibits broad-spectrum activity that includes methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRSA), multidrug-
resistant streptococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing gram-
negative bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii , and many anaerobic organisms. Tigecycline is not active against
Morganella , Proteus , Providencia , or Pseudomonas  species.
1102
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1103 ---

C.  Resistance
Tigecycline was developed to overcome the emergence of tetracycline class–resistant organisms that utilize efflux
pumps and ribosomal protection to confer resistance. Resistance to tigecycline has been observed and is primarily
attributed to overexpression of efflux pumps.
1103
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1104 ---

D.  Pharmacokinetics
Following IV infusion, tigecycline exhibits a large volume of distribution. It penetrates tissues well but achieves low
plasma concentrations. Consequently, tigecycline is a poor option for bloodstream infections. The primary route of
elimination is biliary/fecal. No dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with renal impairment; however, a
dose reduction is recommended in severe hepatic dysfunction.
1104
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1105 ---

E.  Adverse effects
Tigecycline is associated with significant nausea and vomiting. Acute pancreatitis, including fatality, has been
reported with therapy. Elevations in liver enzymes and serum creatinine may also occur. All-cause mortality in
patients treated with tigecycline is higher than with other agents. A boxed warning states that tigecycline should be
reserved for use in situations when alternative treatments are not suitable. Other adverse effects are similar to those
of the tetracyclines and include photosensitivity, pseudotumor cerebri, discoloration of permanent teeth when used
during tooth development, and fetal harm when administered in pregnancy. Tigecycline may decrease the clearance
of warfarin. Therefore, the international normalized ratio should be monitored closely when tigecycline is
coadministered with warfarin.

--- PAGE 1106 ---

IV.  Aminoglycosides
Aminoglycosides are used for the treatment of serious infections due to aerobic gram-negative bacilli; however, their
clinical utility is limited due to serious toxicities.
1106
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1107 ---

A.  Mechanism of action
Aminoglycosides diffuse through porin channels in the outer membrane of susceptible organisms. These organisms
also have an oxygen-dependent system that transports the drug across the cytoplasmic membrane. Inside the cell,
they bind the 30S ribosomal subunit, where they interfere with assembly of the functional ribosomal apparatus
and/or cause the 30S subunit of the completed ribosome to misread the genetic code (Figure 30.2). Aminoglycosides
have concentration-dependent bactericidal activity; that is, their efficacy is dependent on the maximum
concentration (Cmax) of drug above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the organism. For
aminoglycosides, the target Cmax is eight to ten times the MIC. They also exhibit a postantibiotic effect (PAE),
which is continued bacterial suppression after drug concentrations fall below the MIC. The larger the dose, the
longer the PAE. Because of these properties, high-dose extended-interval dosing is commonly utilized. This dosing
strategy also reduces the risk of nephrotoxicity and increases convenience.
1107
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1108 ---

B.  Antibacterial spectrum
The aminoglycosides are effective for the majority of aerobic gram-negative bacilli, including those that may be
multidrug resistant, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Enterobacter  sp. Additionally,
aminoglycosides are often combined with a β-lactam antibiotic to employ a synergistic effect, particularly in the
treatment of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium  infective endocarditis. Some therapeutic applications
of four commonly used aminoglycosides—amikacin [am-i-KAY-sin], gentamicin [jen-ta-MYE-sin], tobramycin
[toe-bra-MYE-sin], and streptomycin [strep-toe-MYE-sin]—are shown in Figure 30.7.

Figure 30.7 Typical therapeutic applications of aminoglycosides. UTI = urinary tract
infection.
1110
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1111 ---

C.  Resistance
Resistance to aminoglycosides occurs via: 1) efflux pumps, 2) decreased uptake, and/or 3) modification and
inactivation by plasmid-associated synthesis of enzymes. Each of these enzymes has its own aminoglycoside
specificity; therefore, cross-resistance cannot be presumed. [Note: Amikacin is less vulnerable to these enzymes than
other antibiotics in this group.]
1111
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1112 ---

D.  Pharmacokinetics
1.  Absorption
The highly polar, polycationic structure of the aminoglycosides prevents adequate absorption after oral
administration; therefore, all aminoglycosides (except neomycin [nee-oh-MYE-sin]) must be given parenterally to
achieve adequate serum concentrations (Figure 30.8). [Note: Neomycin is not given parenterally due to severe
nephrotoxicity. It is administered topically for skin infections or orally to decontaminate the gastrointestinal tract
prior to colorectal surgery.]
Figure 30.8 Administration and fate of aminoglycosides. CNS = central nervous system.
2.  Distribution
Because of their hydrophilicity, aminoglycoside tissue concentrations may be subtherapeutic, and penetration into
most body fluids is variable. Concentrations achieved in CSF are inadequate, even in the presence of inflamed
meninges. For central nervous system infections, the intrathecal or intraventricular routes may be utilized. All
aminoglycosides cross the placental barrier and may accumulate in fetal plasma and amniotic fluid.
3.  Elimination
More than 90% of the parenteral aminoglycosides are excreted unchanged in the urine ( Figure 30.8). Accumulation
occurs in patients with renal dysfunction; thus, dose adjustments are required. Neomycin is primarily excreted
unchanged in the feces.
1112
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1113 ---

E.  Adverse effects
Therapeutic drug monitoring of gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin plasma concentrations is imperative to ensure
appropriateness of dosing and to minimize dose-related toxicities (Figure 30.9). The elderly are particularly
susceptible to nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity.
Figure 30.9 Some adverse effects of aminoglycosides.
1.  Ototoxicity
Ototoxicity (vestibular and auditory) is directly related to high peak plasma concentrations and the duration of
treatment. Aminoglycosides accumulate in the endolymph and perilymph of the inner ear. Deafness may be
irreversible and has been known to affect developing fetuses. Patients simultaneously receiving concomitant
ototoxic drugs, such as cisplatin or loop diuretics, are particularly at risk. Vertigo (especially in patients receiving
streptomycin) may also occur.
1113
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1114 ---

2.  Nephrotoxicity
Retention of the aminoglycosides by the proximal tubular cells disrupts calcium-mediated transport processes. This
results in kidney damage ranging from mild, reversible renal impairment to severe, potentially irreversible acute
tubular necrosis.
3.  Neuromuscular paralysis
This adverse effect is associated with a rapid increase in concentration (for example, high doses infused over a short
period) or concurrent administration with neuromuscular blockers. Patients with myasthenia gravis are particularly
at risk. Prompt administration of calcium gluconate or neostigmine can reverse the block that causes neuromuscular
paralysis.
4.  Allergic reactions
Contact dermatitis is a common reaction to topically applied neomycin.
1114
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1115 ---

V.  Macrolides and Ketolides
The macrolides are a group of antibiotics with a macrocyclic lactone structure to which one or more deoxy sugars
are attached. Erythromycin [er-ith-roe-MYE-sin] was the first of these drugs to have clinical application, both as a
drug of first choice and as an alternative to penicillin in individuals with an allergy to β-lactam antibiotics.
Clarithromycin [kla-rith-roe-MYE-sin] (a methylated form of erythromycin) and azithromycin [a-zith-roe-MYE-sin]
(having a larger lactone ring) have some features in common with, and others that improve upon, erythromycin.
Telithromycin [tel-ith-roe-MYE-sin], a semisynthetic derivative of erythromycin, is a “ketolide” antimicrobial agent
(no longer used in the United States).
1115
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1116 ---

A.  Mechanism of action
The macrolides and ketolides bind irreversibly to a site on the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, thus inhibiting
translocation steps of protein synthesis (Figure 30.2). They may also interfere with other steps, such as
transpeptidation. Generally considered to be bacteriostatic, they may be bactericidal at higher doses. Their binding
site is either identical to or in close proximity to that for clindamycin and chloramphenicol.
1116
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1117 ---

B.  Antibacterial spectrum
1.  Erythromycin
This drug is effective against many of the same organisms as penicillin G (Figure 30.10); therefore, it may be
considered as an alternative in patients with penicillin allergy.
Figure 30.10 Typical therapeutic applications of macrolides.
2.  Clarithromycin
Clarithromycin has activity similar to erythromycin, but it is also effective against Haemophilus influenzae  and has
greater activity against intracellular pathogens such as Chlamydia , Legionella , Moraxella , Ureaplasma  species, and
Helicobacter pylori .
3.  Azithromycin
Although less active than erythromycin against streptococci and staphylococci , azithromycin is far more active
against respiratory pathogens such as H. influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis . Extensive use of azithromycin has
resulted in growing Streptococcus pneumoniae  resistance.
4.  Telithromycin
Telithromycin has an antimicrobial spectrum similar to that of azithromycin. Moreover, the structural modification
within ketolides neutralizes the most common resistance mechanisms that render macrolides ineffective.
1117
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1118 ---

C.  Resistance
Resistance to macrolides is associated with: 1) the inability of the organism to take up the antibiotic, 2) the presence
of efflux pumps, 3) a decreased affinity of the 50S ribosomal subunit for the antibiotic due to methylation of an
adenine in the 23S bacterial ribosomal RNA in gram-positive organisms, and 4) the presence of plasmid- associated
erythromycin esterases in gram-negative organisms such as the Enterobacteriaceae. Erythromycin has limited
clinical use due to increasing resistance. Both clarithromycin and azithromycin share some cross-resistance with
erythromycin. Telithromycin may be effective against macrolide-resistant organisms.
1118
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1119 ---

D.  Pharmacokinetics
1.  Absorption
The erythromycin base is destroyed by gastric acid; thus, either enteric-coated tablets or esterified forms of the
antibiotic are administered and all have adequate oral absorption (Figure 30.11). Clarithromycin, azithromycin, and
telithromycin are stable in stomach acid and are readily absorbed. Food interferes with the absorption of
erythromycin and azithromycin but can increase that of clarithromycin. Telithromycin is administered orally without
regard to meals. Erythromycin and azithromycin are available in IV formulations.
Figure 30.11 Administration and fate of the macrolide antibiotics. CNS = central nervous
system.
2.  Distribution
Erythromycin distributes well to all body fluids except the CSF. It is one of the few antibiotics that diffuse into
prostatic fluid, and it also accumulates in macrophages. All four drugs concentrate in the liver. Clarithromycin,
azithromycin, and telithromycin are widely distributed in the tissues. Azithromycin concentrates in neutrophils,
macrophages, and fibroblasts, and serum concentrations are low. It has the largest volume of distribution of the four
drugs
3.  Elimination
Erythromycin and telithromycin undergo hepatic metabolism. They inhibit the oxidation of a number of drugs
through their interaction with the cytochrome P450 system. Interference with the metabolism of drugs such as
theophylline, statins, and numerous antiepileptics has been reported for clarithromycin.
4.  Excretion
Azithromycin is primarily concentrated and excreted in the bile as active drug. Erythromycin and its metabolites are
also excreted in the bile (Figure 30.11). Partial reabsorption occurs through the enterohepatic circulation. In contrast,
clarithromycin is hepatically metabolized, and the active drug and its metabolites are mainly excreted in the urine
(Figure 30.12). The dosage of this drug should be adjusted in patients with renal impairment.

--- PAGE 1121 ---

E.  Adverse effects
1.  Gastric distress and motility
Gastrointestinal upset is the most common adverse effect of the macrolides and may lead to poor patient compliance
(especially with erythromycin). The other macrolides seem to be better tolerated (Figure 30.13). Higher doses of
erythromycin lead to smooth muscle contractions that result in the movement of gastric contents to the duodenum,
an adverse effect sometimes employed for the treatment of gastroparesis or postoperative ileus.
Figure 30.13 Some adverse effects of macrolide antibiotics.
2.  Cholestatic jaundice
This adverse effect occurs most commonly with the estolate form of erythromycin (not used in the United States);
however, it has been reported with other formulations and other agents in this class.
1121
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1122 ---

3.  Ototoxicity
Transient deafness has been associated with erythromycin, especially at high dosages. Azithromycin has also been
associated with irreversible sensorineural hearing loss.
4.  QT c prolongation
Macrolides and ketolides may prolong the QTc interval and should be used with caution in those patients with
proarrhythmic conditions or concomitant use of proarrhythmic agents.
5.  Contraindications
Patients with hepatic dysfunction should be treated cautiously with erythromycin, telithromycin, or azithromycin,
because these drugs accumulate in the liver. Severe hepatotoxicity with telithromycin has limited its use, given the
availability of alternative therapies.
6.  Drug Interactions
Erythromycin, telithromycin, and clarithromycin inhibit the hepatic metabolism of a number of drugs, which can
lead to toxic accumulation of these compounds (Figure 30.14). An interaction with digoxin may occur. One theory
to explain this interaction is that the antibiotic eliminates a species of intestinal flora that ordinarily inactivates
digoxin, leading to greater reabsorption of digoxin from the enterohepatic circulation.

VI.  Fidaxomicin
Fidaxomicin [fye-DAX-oh-MYE-sin] is a macrocyclic antibiotic with a structure similar to the macrolides; however,
it has a unique mechanism of action. Fidaxomicin acts on the sigma subunit of RNA polymerase, thereby disrupting
bacterial transcription, terminating protein synthesis and resulting in cell death in susceptible organisms.
Fidaxomicin has a very narrow spectrum of activity limited to gram-positive aerobes and anaerobes. While it
possesses activity against staphylococci and enterococci, it is used primarily for its bactericidal activity against
Clostridium difficile. Because of the unique target site, cross-resistance with other antibiotic classes has not been
documented. Following oral administration, fidaxomicin has minimal systemic absorption and primarily remains
within the gastrointestinal tract. This is ideal for the treatment of C. difficile  infection, which occurs in the gut. The
most common adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Anemia and neutropenia have been
observed infrequently. Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema, dyspnea, and pruritus have occurred.
Fidaxomicin should be used with caution in patients with a macrolide allergy, as they may be at increased risk for
hypersensitivity.

VII.  Chloramphenicol
The use of chloramphenicol  [klor-am-FEN-i-kole], a broad-spectrum antibiotic, is restricted to life-threatening
infections for which no alternatives exist.
1124
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1125 ---

A.  Mechanism of action
Chloramphenicol  binds reversibly to the bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit and inhibits protein synthesis at the
peptidyl transferase reaction (Figure 30.2). Because of some similarity of mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes to
those of bacteria, protein and ATP synthesis in these organelles may be inhibited at high circulating
chloramphenicol  concentrations, producing bone marrow toxicity. [Note: The oral formulation of chloramphenicol
was removed from the US market due to this toxicity.]
1125
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1126 ---

B.  Antibacterial spectrum
Chloramphenicol  is active against many types of microorganisms including chlamydiae, rickettsiae, spirochetes, and
anaerobes. The drug is primarily bacteriostatic, but it may exert bactericidal activity depending on the dose and
organism.
1126
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1127 ---

C.  Resistance
Resistance is conferred by the presence of enzymes that inactivate chloramphenicol . Other mechanisms include
decreased ability to penetrate the organism and ribosomal binding site alterations.
1127
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1128 ---

D.  Pharmacokinetics
Chloramphenicol  is administered intravenously and is widely distributed throughout the body. It reaches therapeutic
concentrations in the CSF. Chloramphenicol  primarily undergoes hepatic metabolism to an inactive glucuronide,
which is secreted by the renal tubule and eliminated in the urine. Dose reductions are necessary in patients with liver
dysfunction or cirrhosis. Chloramphenicol  is also secreted into breast milk and should be avoided in breastfeeding
mothers.
1128
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1129 ---

E.  Adverse effects
1.  Anemias
Patients may experience dose-related anemia, hemolytic anemia (observed in patients with glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase deficiency), and aplastic anemia. [Note: Aplastic anemia is independent of dose and may occur after
therapy has ceased.]
2.  Gray baby syndrome
Neonates have a low capacity to glucuronidate the antibiotic, and they have underdeveloped renal function, which
decreases their ability to excrete the drug. This leads to drug accumulation to concentrations that interfere with the
function of mitochondrial ribosomes, causing poor feeding, depressed breathing, cardiovascular collapse, cyanosis
(hence the term “gray baby”), and death. Adults who have received very high doses of chloramphenicol  may also
exhibit this toxicity.
3.  Drug interactions
Chloramphenicol  inhibits some of the hepatic mixed-function oxidases, preventing the metabolism of drugs such as
warfarin and phenytoin, which may potentiate their effects.

--- PAGE 1130 ---

VIII.  Clindamycin
Clindamycin [klin-da-MYE-sin] has a mechanism of action that is similar to that of the macrolides. Clindamycin is
used primarily in the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive organisms, including MRSA and
streptococcus, and anaerobic bacteria. Resistance mechanisms are the same as those for erythromycin, and cross-
resistance has been described. C. difficile  is resistant to clindamycin, and the utility of clindamycin for gram-
negative anaerobes (for example, Bacteroides  sp.) is decreasing due to increasing resistance. Clindamycin is
available in both IV and oral formulations, but use of oral clindamycin is limited by gastrointestinal intolerance. It
distributes well into all body fluids but exhibits poor entry into the CSF. Clindamycin undergoes extensive oxidative
metabolism to active and inactive products and is excreted into bile and urine. Low urinary excretion of active drug
limits its clinical utility for urinary tract infections (Figure 30.15). Accumulation has been reported in patients with
either severe renal impairment or hepatic failure. In addition to skin rash, the most common adverse effect is
diarrhea, which may represent a serious pseudomembranous colitis caused by overgrowth of C. difficile. Oral
administration of either metronidazole or vancomycin is usually effective in the treatment of C. difficile  infection.

IX.  Quinupristin/Dalfopristin
Quinupristin/dalfopristin [KWIN-yoo-pris-tin/DAL-foh-pris-tin] is a mixture of two streptogramins in a ratio of 30
to 70, respectively. Due to significant adverse effects, this combination drug is normally reserved for the treatment
of severe infections caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) in the absence of other therapeutic
options.
1131
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1132 ---

A.  Mechanism of action
Each component of this combination drug binds to a separate site on the 50S bacterial ribosome. Dalfopristin
disrupts elongation by interfering with the addition of new amino acids to the peptide chain. Quinupristin prevents
elongation similar to the macrolides and causes release of incomplete peptide chains. Thus, they synergistically
interrupt protein synthesis. The combination drug has bactericidal activity against most susceptible organisms and
has a long PAE.
1132
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1133 ---

B.  Antibacterial spectrum
Quinupristin/dalfopristin is active primarily against gram-positive cocci, including those resistant to other
antibiotics. Its primary use is for the treatment of E. faecium  infections, including VRE strains, against which it is
bacteriostatic. The drug is not effective against E. faecalis .
1133
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1134 ---

C.  Resistance
Enzymatic processes commonly account for resistance to these agents. For example, the presence of a ribosomal
enzyme that methylates the target bacterial 23S ribosomal RNA site can interfere in quinupristin binding. In some
cases, the enzymatic modification can change the action from bactericidal to bacteriostatic. Plasmid-associated
acetyltransferase inactivates dalfopristin. An active efflux pump can also decrease levels of the antibiotics in
bacteria.
1134
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1135 ---

D.  Pharmacokinetics
Quinupristin/dalfopristin is available intravenously. It does not achieve therapeutic concentrations in CSF. Both
compounds undergo hepatic metabolism, with excretion mainly in the feces.
1135
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1136 ---

E.  Adverse effects
Venous irritation commonly occurs when quinupristin/dalfopristin is administered through a peripheral rather than a
central line. Hyperbilirubinemia occurs in about 25% of patients, resulting from a competition with the antibiotic for
excretion. Arthralgia and myalgia have been reported when higher doses are administered. Quinupristin/dalfopristin
inhibits the cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 isoenzyme, and concomitant administration with drugs that are metabolized
by this pathway may lead to toxicities.

X.  Oxazolidinones
Linezolid [lih-NEH-zo-lid] and tedizolid [ted-eye-ZOE-lid] are synthetic oxazolidinones developed to combat gram-
positive organisms, including resistant isolates such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , VRE, and
penicillin-resistant streptococci.
1137
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1138 ---

A.  Mechanism of action
Linezolid and tedizolid bind to the bacterial 23S ribosomal RNA of the 50S subunit, thereby inhibiting the formation
of the 70S initiation complex (Figure 30.2) and translation of bacterial proteins.
1138
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1139 ---

B.  Antibacterial spectrum
The antibacterial action of the oxazolidinones is directed primarily against gram-positive organisms such as
staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci, Corynebacterium  species and Listeria monocytogenes . It is also
moderately active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis  (Figure 30.16). The main clinical use of linezolid and
tedizolid is to treat infections caused by drug-resistant gram-positive organisms. Like other agents that interfere with
bacterial protein synthesis, linezolid and tedizolid are bacteriostatic; however, linezolid has bactericidal activity
against streptococci. Linezolid is an alternative to daptomycin for infections caused by VRE. Because they are
bacteriostatic, the oxazolidinones are not recommended as first-line treatment for MRSA bacteremia.
Figure 30.16 Antimicrobial spectrum of oxazolidinones.
1139
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1140 ---

C.  Resistance
Resistance primarily occurs via reduced binding at the target site. Reduced susceptibility and resistance have been
reported in S. aureus  and Enterococcus  sp. Cross-resistance with other protein synthesis inhibitors does not occur.
1140
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1141 ---

D.  Pharmacokinetics
Linezolid and tedizolid are well absorbed after oral administration. IV formulations are also available. These drugs
distribute widely throughout the body. Although the metabolic pathway of linezolid has not been fully determined, it
is known that it is metabolized via oxidation to two inactive metabolites. The drug is excreted both by renal and
nonrenal routes. Tedizolid is metabolized by sulfation, and the majority of elimination occurs via the liver, and drug
is mainly excreted in the feces. No dose adjustments are required for either agent for renal or hepatic dysfunction.
1141
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1142 ---

E.  Adverse effects
The most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal upset, nausea, diarrhea, headache, and rash.
Thrombocytopenia has been reported, usually in patients taking the drug for longer than 10 days. Linezolid and
tedizolid possess nonselective monoamine oxidase activity and may lead to serotonin syndrome if given
concomitantly with large quantities of tyramine-containing foods, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or
monoamine oxidase inhibitors. The condition is reversible when the drug is discontinued. Irreversible peripheral
neuropathies and optic neuritis causing blindness have been associated with greater than 28 days of use, limiting
utility for extended-duration treatments.

30.6Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
Which of the following adverse effects is often employed as a therapeutic use for erythromycin?
A.  QTc prolongation
B.  Increased gastrointestinal motility
C.  Photosensitivity
D.  Deposition in bone
Correct answer = B. Macrolides, but especially erythromycin, cause GI distress and increase motility of the GI
tract, which is often used to treat gastroparesis and/or postoperative ileus. QTc prolongation is an adverse effect
of erythromycin but not one employed therapeutically. Photosensitivity and deposition in bone are adverse effects
of tetracyclines.
Which of the following describes the mechanism of action of tetracycline antibiotics?
A.  Bind the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, preventing binding of tRNA to the mRNA–ribosome complex.
B.  Bind the 30S ribosomal subunit, interfering with assembly of the functional ribosomal apparatus.
C.  Bind irreversibly to a site on the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, inhibiting translocation steps of protein
synthesis.
D.  Bind the bacterial 23S ribosomal RNA of the 50S subunit, inhibiting the formation of the 70S initiation complex.
Correct answer = A. Tetracyclines enter susceptible organisms via passive diffusion and also by an energy-
dependent transport protein mechanism unique to the bacterial inner cytoplasmic membrane. The drugs bind
reversibly to the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome. This action prevents binding of tRNA to the mRNA–
ribosome complex, thereby inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. B is the mechanism for aminoglycosides, C is
the mechanism for macrolides, and D is the mechanism for oxazolidinones.
Linezolid would be a good choice for antibiotic treatment in which of the following patient scenarios?
A.  Bacteremia caused by Staphylococcus aureusB.  Urinary tract infection caused by Escherichia coli
C.  Pneumonia caused by drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae
D.  Diabetic foot infection caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Correct answer = C. Linezolid does have coverage against resistant S. pneumoniae . It is not an optimal choice for
treatment of bacteremia. Linezolid also does not have gram-negative coverage against E. coli  and P. aeruginosa .
After 5 days of clindamycin treatment for a skin infection, a patient develops diarrhea (10 watery stools/day),
severe abdominal pain, and fever. Which of the following organisms would you be concerned about as the
causative pathogen of diarrhea?
A.  Escherichia coliB.  Bacteroides fragilis
C.  Staphylococcus aureus
D.  Clostridium difficile
Correct answer = D. Clindamycin use has been associated with Clostridium difficile –associated diarrhea. This
infection should be considered in a patient who presents with diarrhea while on clindamycin.
Which of the following statements accurately describes the difference in spectrum of activity between
erythromycin and azithromycin?
A.  Azithromycin has better activity against respiratory pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella
catarrhalis  but less potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.
B.  Erythromycin has the same activity as azithromycin against gram-positives and gram-negatives.
C.  Azithromycin has better activity against staphylococci and streptococci compared to erythromycin.
D.  Erythromycin has better activity against gram-negatives such as H. influenza.Correct answer = A. Erythromycin has better activity against gram-positive organisms, so B and C are incorrect.
D is incorrect as azithromycin has better activity against H. influenza.
Which of the following antibiotic agents should not be given to children less than 8 years of age due to its
deposition in bone and teeth?
A.  Azithromycin
B.  Doxycycline
C.  Linezolid
D.  Quinupristin/dalfopristin
Correct answer = B. Tetracyclines are contraindicated in this age group because they are deposited in tissues
undergoing calcification, such as teeth and bone, and can stunt growth.1143

30.10A 77-year-old woman was started on antibiotics for pneumonia treatment. After 3 days of antibiotic therapy,
the serum creatinine doubled. Which of the following antibiotics is most likely responsible for this increase
in serum creatinine?
A.  Doxycycline
B.  Clarithromycin
C.  Tobramycin
D.  Linezolid
Correct answer = C. Aminoglycosides such as tobramycin accumulate in the proximal tubular cells of the kidney
and disrupt calcium-mediated transport processes. This results in kidney damage ranging from mild, reversible
renal impairment to severe, potentially irreversible acute tubular necrosis. Nephrotoxicity is not commonly
associated with tetracyclines, macrolides or oxazolidinones.
A 24-year-old pregnant woman was diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia and will be managed in
the outpatient setting. Which antibiotic is a safe option for this patient to treat her pneumonia?
A.  Azithromycin
B.  Doxycycline
C.  Fidaxomicin
D.  Gentamicin
Correct answer = A. Azithromycin is available orally and considered safe in pregnancy. Doxycycline should not
be used in pregnancy due to its ability to cross the placenta and affect bone and skeletal development in the fetus.
Fidaxomicin does not reach therapeutic concentrations in serum or at this site of infection. It concentrates in the
gut. Gentamicin crosses the placental barrier and may accumulate in fetal plasma and amniotic fluid. It would
also not be used clinically in this outpatient scenario.
Parents of a 1-month-old baby are told their child has developed “gray baby syndrome.” Which of the
following antibiotics did the baby likely receive?
A.  Tobramycin
B.  Linezolid
C.  Erythromycin
D.  Chloramphenicol
Correct answer = D. Gray baby syndrome is an adverse effect caused by chloramphenicol in neonates due to their
underdeveloped renal function and low capacity to glucuronidate the antibiotic. The other agents do not undergo
this glucuronidation.
Aminoglycosides are commonly used for their concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against which
group of organisms?
A.  Gram-positive aerobes
B.  Gram-negative aerobes
C.  Gram-positive anaerobes
D.  Gram-negative anaerobes
Correct answer = B. Although aminoglycosides (such as gentamicin) are sometimes used synergistically against
gram-positive aerobes, this is not their most common use. They are typically used for their activity against gram-
negative aerobes. Aminoglycosides do not have good anaerobic activity.1144

I.  Fluoroquinolones
Discovery of quinolone antimicrobials led to the development of numerous compounds utilized in clinical practice.
Following synthesis of nalidixic acid in the early 1960s, continued modification of the quinolone nucleus expanded
the spectrum of activity, improved pharmacokinetics, and stabilized compounds against common mechanisms of
resistance. Due to these enhancements, quinolone antimicrobials were rapidly integrated into human and agricultural
medicine. Unfortunately, overuse resulted in rising rates of resistance in gram-negative and gram-positive
organisms, increased frequency of Clostridium difficile infections, and identification of numerous untoward adverse
effects. Consequently, these agents have been relegated to second-line options for various indications. This chapter
reviews key characteristics of fluoroquinolones and their role in therapy. The fluoroquinolones and other antibiotics
discussed in this chapter are listed in Figure 31.1.
Figure 31.1 Summary of drugs described in this chapter.

--- PAGE 1148 ---

A.  Mechanism of action
Most bacterial species maintain two distinct type II topoisomerases that assist with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
replication, DNA gyrase, and topoisomerase IV. DNA gyrase is responsible for reducing torsional stress ahead of
replicating forks by breaking double-strand DNA and introducing negative supercoils. Topoisomerase IV assists in
separating daughter chromosomes once replication is completed. Following cell wall entry through porin channels,
fluoroquinolones bind to these enzymes and interfere with DNA ligation. This interference increases the number of
permanent chromosomal breaks, triggering cell lysis. In general, fluoroquinolones have different targets for gram-
negative (DNA gyrase) and gram-positive organisms (topoisomerase IV), resulting in rapid cell death.
1148
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1149 ---

B.  Antimicrobial spectrum
Fluoroquinolones are bactericidal and exhibit area-under-the-curve/minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC)-
dependent killing. A major facet of their development centered on improving microbiologic coverage. Modifications
to the quinolone nucleus steadily improved topoisomerase inhibitory activity and facilitated bacterial cell wall
penetration. These changes enhanced activity against a variety of pathogens including aerobic gram-negative and
gram-positive organisms, atypical organisms (for example, Chlamydia, Legionella , and Mycoplasma  spp.), and
anaerobes. Based on the impact of these structural changes, fluoroquinolones are often classified according to
spectrum of activity.
First-generation compounds (for example, nalidixic acid) were narrow spectrum agents with activity against
aerobic gram-negative bacilli, mostly Enterobacteriaceae. Second-generation compounds (for example,
ciprofloxacin) exhibit improved intracellular penetration and broadened coverage, which includes
Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae , Neisseria  spp., Chlamydia  spp., and
Legionella  spp. Third-generation compounds (for example, levofloxacin) maintain the bacterial spectrum of second-
generation agents, with improved activity against Streptococcus  spp., including S. pneumoniae , methicillin-
susceptible Staphylococcus aureus , Stenotrophomonas maltophilia , and Mycobacterium  spp. Fourth-generation
compounds (moxifloxacin, gemifloxacin, and delafloxacin) have enhanced gram-positive activity, including
Staphylococcus  and Streptococcus  spp. Delafloxacin has activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA) and Enterococcus faecalis . Further, delafloxacin and moxifloxacin have activity against Bacteroides fragilis
and Prevotella  spp., while maintaining activity against Enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae . From this
group, only delafloxacin has activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Lastly, these agents maintain atypical
coverage, with moxifloxacin and delafloxacin showing activity against Mycobacteria  spp. Common therapeutic
applications of fluoroquinolones are shown in Figure 31.2.
Figure 31.2 Typical therapeutic applications of fluoroquinolones.

www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1150 ---

C.  Resistance
Numerous mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance exist in clinical pathogens. High-level fluoroquinolone
resistance is primarily driven by chromosomal mutations within topoisomerases, although decreased entry, efflux
systems, and modifying enzymes play a role. Mechanisms responsible for resistance include the following:
1.  Altered target binding
Mutations in bacterial genes encoding DNA gyrase or topoisomerase IV (for example, gyrA or parC) alter target site
structure and reduce binding efficiency of fluoroquinolones.
2.  Decreased accumulation
Reduced intracellular concentration is linked to 1) a reduction in membrane permeability or 2) efflux pumps.
Alterations in membrane permeability are mediated through a reduction in outer membrane porin proteins, thus
limiting drug access to topoisomerases. Efflux pumps actively remove fluoroquinolones from the cell.
3.  Fluoroquinolone degradation
An aminoglycoside acetyltransferase variant can acetylate fluoroquinolones, rendering them inactive.
1150
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1151 ---

D.  Pharmacokinetics
1.  Absorption
Fluoroquinolones are well absorbed after oral administration, with levofloxacin and moxifloxacin having a
bioavailability that exceeds 90% (Figure 31.3). Ingestion of fluoroquinolones with sucralfate, aluminum- or
magnesium-containing antacids, or dietary supplements containing iron or zinc can reduce the absorption. Calcium
and other divalent cations also interfere with the absorption of these agents (Figure 31.4).
Figure 31.3 Administration and fate of the fluoroquinolones.
1151
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1152 ---

Figure 31.4 Effect of dietary calcium on the absorption of ciprofloxacin.
2.  Distribution
Binding to plasma proteins ranges from 20% to 84%. Fluoroquinolones distribute well into all tissues and body
fluids. Concentrations are high in bone, urine (except moxifloxacin), kidney, prostatic tissue (but not prostatic fluid),
and lungs as compared to serum. Penetration into cerebrospinal fluid is good, and these agents may be considered in
certain central nervous system (CNS) infections. Accumulation in macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes
results in activity against intracellular organisms such as Listeria, Chlamydia , and Mycobacterium .
3.  Elimination
Most fluoroquinolones are excreted renally. Therefore, dosage adjustments are needed in renal dysfunction.
Moxifloxacin is metabolized primarily by the liver, and while there is some renal excretion, no dose adjustment is
required for renal impairment (see Figure 31.3).
1152
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1153 ---

E.  Adverse reactions
In general, fluoroquinolones are well tolerated ( Figure 31.5). Common adverse effects leading to discontinuation are
nausea, vomiting, headache, and dizziness. These agents carry boxed warnings for tendinitis, tendon rupture,
peripheral neuropathy, and CNS effects (hallucinations, anxiety, insomnia, confusion, and seizures). Patients taking
fluoroquinolones are at risk for phototoxicity resulting in exaggerated sunburn reactions. Patients should use
sunscreen and avoid excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. Arthropathy is uncommon, but arthralgia and
arthritis are reported with fluoroquinolone use in pediatric patients. Use in the pediatric population should be limited
to distinct clinical scenarios (for example, cystic fibrosis exacerbation). Hepatotoxicity or blood glucose
disturbances (usually in diabetic patients receiving oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin) have been observed.
Identification of any of these events should result in prompt removal of the agent. Fluoroquinolones may prolong the
QTc interval, and these agents should be avoided in patients predisposed to arrhythmias or taking medication
associated with QT prolongation. Ciprofloxacin inhibits P450 1A2- and 3A4-mediated metabolism. Serum
concentrations of medications such as theophylline, tizanidine, warfarin, ropinirole, duloxetine, caffeine, sildenafil ,
and zolpidem may be increased (Figure 31.6).

--- PAGE 1154 ---

F.  Examples of clinically useful fluoroquinolones
Due to increasing resistance and boxed warnings, fluoroquinolones should be used with caution in select
circumstances. They may be considered in patients who do not tolerate other agents (for example, severe beta-lactam
allergies) or as definitive therapy once susceptibilities are available. Listed below are potential indications for these
agents.
1.  Ciprofloxacin
Ciprofloxacin [SIP-roe-FLOX-a-sin] has good activity against gram-negative bacilli, including P. aeruginosa.
Ciprofloxacin is used in the treatment of traveler’s diarrhea, typhoid fever, and anthrax. It is a second-line agent for
infections arising from intra-abdominal, lung, skin, or urine sources. Of note, high-dose therapy should be employed
when treating Pseudomonas infections.
2.  Levofloxacin
Levofloxacin [leev-oh-FLOX-a-sin] has similar activity to ciprofloxacin and they are often interchanged when
managing gram-negative bacilli, including P. aeruginosa . Levofloxacin has enhanced activity against S. pneumoniae
and is first-line therapy for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). It is a second-line agent for the treatment of S.
maltophilia .
3.  Moxifloxacin
Moxifloxacin [mox-ee-FLOX-a-sin] has enhanced activity against gram-positive organisms (for example, S.pneumoniae ), gram-negative anaerobes, and Mycobacterium  spp. The drug may be used for CAP, but not hospital-
acquired pneumonia due to poor coverage of P. aeruginosa . It may be considered for mild-to-moderate intra-
abdominal infections, but should be avoided if patients have fluoroquinolone exposure within previous three
months, due to increasing B. fragilis  resistance. Moxifloxacin may be considered as a second-line agent for
management of drug-susceptible tuberculosis.
4.  Gemifloxacin
Gemifloxacin [gem-ee-FLOX-a-sin] is indicated for management of community-acquired respiratory infections.
Unlike the other compounds, it is only available as an oral formulation.
5.  Delafloxacin
Delafloxacin [del-a-FLOX-a-sin] has improved activity against gram-positive cocci, including MRSA and
Enterococcus  spp. Due to its spectrum of activity, it is an option for managing acute bacterial skin and skin structure
infections. It is available as an intravenous and oral formulation.

II.  Folate Antagonists
Folic acid is a coenzyme essential in the synthesis of ribonucleic acid (RNA), DNA, and certain amino acids. In the
absence of folate, cells cannot grow or divide. Humans use dietary folate to synthesize the critical folate derivative,
tetrahydrofolic acid. By contrast, many bacteria are impermeable to folate derivatives, and rely on their ability to
synthesize folate de novo (Figure 31.7). Sulfonamides (sulfa drugs) are a family of antibiotics that inhibit de novo
synthesis of folate. A second type of folate antagonist, trimethoprim, prevents microorganisms from converting
dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid. Thus, both sulfonamides and trimethoprim interfere with the ability of an
infecting bacterium to perform DNA synthesis and other essential cellular functions. The combination of the
sulfonamide sulfamethoxazole with trimethoprim (the generic name for the combination is cotrimoxazole) provides a
synergistic effect.

III.  Sulfonamides
Sulfa drugs were among the first antibiotics used in clinical practice. Today, they are seldom prescribed alone except
in developing countries, where they are employed because of low cost and efficacy.
1158
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1159 ---

A.  Mechanism of action
Microorganisms use the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase to create dihydrofolic acid from the precursor molecule
p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). Sulfonamides are synthetic analogs of PABA. Because of their structural similarity,
sulfonamides compete with PABA to inhibit dihydropteroate synthetase and the genesis of bacterial dihydrofolic
acid (see Figure 31.7). These agents, including cotrimoxazole, are bacteriostatic.
1159
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1160 ---

B.  Antibacterial spectrum
Sulfa drugs have in vitro activity against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. Common organisms include
Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae , Streptococcus  spp., Staphylococcus  spp., and Nocardia . Additionally,
sulfadiazine [sul-fa-DYE-a-zeen] in combination with the dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor pyrimethamine [py-ri-
METH-a-meen] is the preferred treatment for toxoplasmosis.
1160
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1161 ---

C.  Resistance
Bacteria that obtain folate from their environment are naturally resistant to sulfa drugs. Acquired bacterial resistance
to the sulfa drugs can arise from plasmid transfers or random mutations. Resistance may be due to 1) altered
dihydropteroate synthetase, 2) decreased cellular permeability to sulfa drugs, or 3) enhanced production of the
natural substrate, PABA. [Note: Organisms resistant to one member of this drug family are resistant to all.]
1161
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1162 ---

D.  Pharmacokinetics
1.  Absorption
Most sulfa drugs are well absorbed following oral administration (Figure 31.8). An exception is sulfasalazine [sul-
fa-SAL-a-zeen]. It is not absorbed when administered orally or as a suppository and, therefore, is reserved for
treatment of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. [Note: Intestinal flora split sulfasalazine into sulfapyridine and 5-
aminosalicylate, with the latter exerting the anti-inflammatory effect. Absorption of sulfapyridine can lead to
toxicity in patients who are slow acetylators.] Intravenous sulfonamides are generally reserved for patients who are
unable to take oral preparations or have severe infections. Because of the risk of sensitization, sulfa drugs are not
usually applied topically. However, in burn units, silver sulfadiazine [sul-fa-DYE-ah-zeen] or mafenide [mah-FEN-
ide] acetate (α-amino-p-toluenesulfonamide) creams have been effective in reducing burn-associated sepsis because
they prevent colonization of bacteria. [Note: Silver sulfadiazine is preferred because mafenide produces pain on
application and its absorption may contribute to acid–base disturbances.]
Figure 31.8 Administration and fate of the sulfonamides.
2.  Distribution
Sulfa drugs are bound to serum albumin in circulation and widely distribute throughout body tissues. Sulfa drugs
penetrate well into cerebrospinal fluid (even in the absence of inflammation) and cross the placental barrier to enter
fetal tissues.
3.  Metabolism
Sulfa drugs are acetylated and conjugated primarily in the liver. The acetylated product is devoid of antimicrobial
activity but retains the toxic potential to precipitate at neutral or acidic pH. This causes crystalluria (“stone
formation”; see below) and potential damage to the kidney.
4.  Excretion
Unchanged sulfa drug and metabolites are eliminated via glomerular filtration and secretion, requiring dose
adjustments with renal impairment. Sulfonamides may be eliminated in breast milk.

--- PAGE 1164 ---

E.  Adverse effects
1.  Crystalluria
Nephrotoxicity may develop as a result of crystalluria (Figure 31.9). Adequate hydration and alkalinization of urine
can prevent the problem by reducing the concentration of drug and promoting its ionization.
Figure 31.9 Some adverse reactions to sulfonamides.
2.  Hypersensitivity
Hypersensitivity reactions, such as rashes, angioedema, or Stevens-Johnson syndrome, may occur. When patients
report previous sulfa allergies, it is paramount to acquire a description of the reaction to direct appropriate therapy.
1164
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1165 ---

3.  Hematopoietic disturbances
Hemolytic anemia is encountered in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.
Granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia can also occur. Fatal reactions have been reported from associated
agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and other blood dyscrasias.
4.  Kernicterus
Bilirubin-associated brain damage (kernicterus) may occur in newborns, because sulfa drugs displace bilirubin from
binding sites on serum albumin. The bilirubin is then free to pass into the CNS, because the blood–brain barrier is
not fully developed.
5.  Drug potentiation
Sulfamethoxazole potentiates the anticoagulant effect of warfarin due to inhibition of CYP2C9, resulting in reduced
clearance of warfarin. Sulfonamides may also displace warfarin from binding sites on serum albumin. Serum
methotrexate levels may rise through protein binding displacement. Other CYP2C9 substrates, such as phenytoin,
may have increased concentrations when given with sulfonamides.
6.  Contraindications
Due to the danger of kernicterus, sulfa drugs should be avoided in newborns and infants less than 2 months of age,
as well as in pregnant women at term. Sulfonamides should not be given to patients receiving methenamine, since
they can crystallize in the presence of formaldehyde produced by this agent.

IV.  Trimethoprim
Trimethoprim [try-METH-oh-prim], a potent inhibitor of bacterial dihydrofolate reductase, was initially available in
combination with the sulfonamide sulfamethoxazole [sul-fa-meth-OX-a-zole], and later approved for use as a single
agent. Today, trimethoprim is most commonly used in combination with sulfamethoxazole.
1166
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1167 ---

A.  Mechanism of action
Trimethoprim is a potent inhibitor of bacterial dihydrofolate reductase (see Figure 31.7). Inhibition of this enzyme
prevents the formation of the metabolically active form of folic acid, tetrahydrofolic acid, and thus, interferes with
normal bacterial cell functions. Trimethoprim binds to bacterial dihydrofolate reductase more readily than it does to
human dihydrofolate reductase, which accounts for the selective toxicity of the drug.
1167
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1168 ---

B.  Antibacterial spectrum
The antibacterial spectrum of trimethoprim is similar to that of sulfamethoxazole. However, trimethoprim is 20- to
50-fold more potent than the sulfonamides. Trimethoprim may be used alone in the treatment of urinary tract
infections (UTIs) and in the treatment of bacterial prostatitis (although fluoroquinolones and cotrimoxazole are
preferred).
1168
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1169 ---

C.  Resistance
Resistance in gram-negative bacteria is due to the presence of an altered dihydrofolate reductase that has a lower
affinity for trimethoprim. Efflux pumps and decreased permeability to the drug may play a role.
1169
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1170 ---

D.  Pharmacokinetics
Trimethoprim is rapidly absorbed following oral administration. Because the drug is a weak base, higher
concentrations of trimethoprim are achieved in the relatively acidic prostatic and vaginal fluids. The drug is widely
distributed into body tissues and fluids, including penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid. Trimethoprim undergoes
some O-demethylation, but 60% to 80% is renally excreted unchanged.
1170
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1171 ---

E.  Adverse effects
Trimethoprim can produce the effects of folic acid deficiency. These effects include megaloblastic anemia,
leukopenia, and granulocytopenia, especially in pregnant patients and those with nutrient-poor diets. These blood
disorders may be reversed by simultaneous administration of folinic acid (also known as leucovorin), which does not
enter bacteria. Trimethoprim has a potassium-sparing effect and may cause hyperkalemia, especially at higher doses
and when administered with other medication that causes hyperkalemia (for example, angiotensin converting
enzyme inhibitors).
1171
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1172 ---

V.  Cotrimoxazole
The combination of trimethoprim with sulfamethoxazole, called cotrimoxazole [co-try-MOX-a-zole], shows greater
antimicrobial activity than equivalent quantities of either drug used alone (Figure 31.10). The combination was
selected because of the synergistic activity and the similarity in the half-lives of the two drugs.
Figure 31.10 Synergism between trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole inhibits growth of
E. coli .
1172
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1173 ---

A.  Mechanism of action
The synergistic antimicrobial activity of cotrimoxazole results from its inhibition of two sequential steps in the
synthesis of tetrahydrofolic acid. Sulfamethoxazole inhibits the incorporation of PABA into dihydrofolic acid
precursors, and trimethoprim prevents reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate (Figure 31.7).
Figure 31.11 Typical therapeutic applications of cotrimoxazole (sulfamethoxazole plus
trimethoprim).
1173
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1174 ---

B.  Antibacterial spectrum
Cotrimoxazole has a broader spectrum of antibacterial action than the sulfa drugs alone (Figure 31.11). It is effective
in treating UTIs and respiratory tract infections, as well as Pneumocystis jirovecii , toxoplasmosis, Listeria
monocytogenes , and Salmonella  infections. It has activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus  and can be
particularly useful for skin and soft tissue infections caused by this organism. It is the drug of choice for infections
caused by susceptible Nocardia spp. and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia .
1174
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1175 ---

C.  Resistance
Resistance to the trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole combination is encountered less frequently than resistance to
either of the drugs alone, because it requires bacterium to maintain simultaneous resistance to both drugs.
Significant resistance has been documented in a number of clinically relevant organisms, including E. coli .
1175
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1176 ---

D.  Pharmacokinetics
Cotrimoxazole is generally administered orally (Figure 31.12). Intravenous administration may be utilized in
patients with severe pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii . Both agents distribute throughout the body.
Trimethoprim concentrates in the relatively acidic milieu of prostatic fluids, and this accounts for the use of
trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole in the treatment of prostatitis. Cotrimoxazole readily crosses the blood–brain barrier.
Both parent drugs and their metabolites are excreted in the urine.
Figure 31.12 Administration and fate of cotrimoxazole.
1176
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1177 ---

E.  Adverse effects
Adverse reactions and drug interactions related to cotrimoxazole are similar to those expected with each of the
individual components, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (Figure 31.13). The most common adverse reactions are
nausea and vomiting, skin rash, hematologic toxicity, and hyperkalemia.

VI.  Urinary Tract Antiseptics/Antimicrobials
UTIs are one of the most common bacterial infections in the world, primarily impacting women and the elderly.
Historically, fluoroquinolones and cotrimoxazole have been first-line therapy for the treatment of UTIs.
Unfortunately, resistance has increased among common pathogens (for example, E. coli ). As a result, methenamine,
nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin (see Chapter 29) can be considered for treatment or suppression of recurrence, due to
their efficacy against common pathogens and high concentrations in the urine.
1180
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1181 ---

A.  Methenamine
1.  Mechanism of action
Methenamine [meth-EN-a-meen] salts are hydrolyzed to ammonia and formaldehyde in acidic urine (pH ≤ 5.5).
Formaldehyde denatures proteins and nucleic acids, resulting in bacterial cell death. Methenamine is combined with
a weak acid (for example, hippuric acid) to maintain urine acidity and promote production of formaldehyde (Figure
31.14).
Figure 31.14 Formation of formaldehyde from methenamine at acid pH.
2.  Antibacterial spectrum
Methenamine is primarily used for chronic suppressive therapy to reduce the frequency of UTIs. Methenamine is
active against E. coli , Enterococcus  spp., and Staphylococcus  spp. It has some activity against Proteus  spp. and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa , but urine pH must be kept acidic to achieve bactericidal activity. The main benefit of
methenamine is the lack of selection for resistant organisms.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
Methenamine is orally absorbed, with up to 30% decomposing in gastric juices, unless protected by enteric coating.
It reaches the urine through tubular secretion and glomerular filtration. Concentrations are sufficient to treat
susceptible organisms. Due to ammonia formation, use should be avoided in hepatic insufficiency.
4.  Adverse effects
The major adverse effect of methenamine is gastrointestinal distress, although at higher doses, albuminuria,
hematuria, and rashes may develop. Methenamine mandelate is contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency,
because mandelic acid may precipitate. The methenamine hippurate formulation should be used instead. [Note:
Sulfonamides, such as cotrimoxazole, react with formaldehyde and must not be used concomitantly with
methenamine. The combination increases the risk of crystalluria and mutual antagonism.]
1181

--- PAGE 1182 ---

B.  Nitrofurantoin
Nitrofurantoin [NYE-troe-fue-RAN-toin] was introduced into clinical practice for the management of cystitis in the
early 1950s. For decades, it was rarely used, but was resurrected due to increasing antibiotic resistance among
Enterobacteriaceae and is considered first-line therapy for uncomplicated cystitis. Nitrofurantoin works by inhibiting
DNA and RNA synthesis. Susceptible organisms include E. coli, Klebsiella  spp., Enterococcus  spp., and
Staphylococcus  spp. Following oral administration, it is rapidly absorbed, with nearly 40% excreted unchanged in
the urine. Overall, nitrofurantoin is well tolerated. Common adverse events include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Use of the microcrystalline formulation decreases the incidence of gastrointestinal toxicity. Rare complications of
therapy include pulmonary fibrosis, neuropathy, and autoimmune hepatitis. These events are observed with
prolonged exposure greater than 1 month. Additionally, patients with impaired renal function should not receive
nitrofurantoin due to an increased risk of adverse events.

31.6Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
A 32-year-old man presents to an outpatient clinic with a 5-day history of productive cough, purulent
sputum, and shortness of breath. He is diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). It is noted
that this patient has a severe ampicillin allergy (anaphylaxis). Which would be an acceptable treatment for
this patient?
A.  Levofloxacin
B.  Ciprofloxacin
C.  Penicillin VK
D.  Nitrofurantoin
Correct answer = A. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common cause of CAP, and the respiratory fluoroquinolones
levofloxacin and moxifloxacin provide good coverage. Ciprofloxacin does not cover S. pneumoniae  well and is a
poor choice for treatment of CAP. Penicillin would be a poor choice due to allergy. Nitrofurantoin has no clinical
utility for respiratory tract infections.
A 22-year-old woman presents with a 2-day history of dysuria with increased urinary frequency and urgency.
A urine culture and urinalysis are done. She is diagnosed with a urinary tract infection caused by E. coli.
Which agent should be avoided in the treatment of her UTI?
A.  Levofloxacin
B.  Cotrimoxazole
C.  Moxifloxacin
D.  Nitrofurantoin
Correct answer = C. Moxifloxacin does not concentrate in the urine and would be ineffective for treatment of a
UTI. All other answers are viable alternatives, and the resistance profile for the E. coli can be utilized to direct
therapy.
Which drug is correctly matched with the appropriate adverse effect?
A.  Levofloxacin—hyperkalemia
B.  Nitrofurantoin—pulmonary fibrosis
C.  Cotrimoxazole—hepatic encephalopathy
D.  Methenamine—nystagmus
Correct answer = B. Hyperkalemia may be caused by cotrimoxazole, not fluoroquinolones. Hepatic
encephalopathy may be related to therapy with methenamine in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Nystagmus is
not associated with methenamine therapy.
Cotrimoxazole provides activity against which organism?
A.  MRSA
B.  Pseudomonas aeruginosaC.  Anaerobes
D.  Mycoplasma
Correct answer = A. Cotrimoxazole is effective against MRSA. It does not have activity against Pseudomonas ,
anaerobes, or Mycoplasma .
A 55-year-old man presents to primary care clinic with an erythematous and tender abscess on his left thigh.
He has a history of MRSA skin infections. Which is an appropriate antibiotic for empiric treatment?
A.  Ciprofloxacin
B.  Cotrimoxazole
C.  Pyrimethamine
D.  Cephalexin
Correct answer = B. Cotrimoxazole is the only agent with reliable activity against MRSA. Ciprofloxacin does
have some minor activity, but resistance has readily increased and it is no longer a valid recommendation. The
other agents do not have activity against MRSA.
Which is a common adverse effect of cotrimoxazole?
A.  Hyperkalemia
B.  Pulmonary fibrosis
C.  Tendon rupture
D.  Blood glucose disturbances
Correct answer = A. Trimethoprim acts as a potassium-sparing agent, resulting in an increase in serum potassium
concentrations. Pulmonary fibrosis is an adverse effect of nitrofurantoin. Tendon rupture and blood glucose1183

A 21-year-old marathon runner reports to the clinic with acute Achilles tendon rupture. The nurse noted that
the patient recently took an antibiotic for community-acquired pneumonia. Which antibiotic may have
contributed to tendon rupture?
A.  Amoxicillin/clavulanate
B.  Cefdinir
C.  Levofloxacin
D.  Minocycline
Correct answer = C. Levofloxacin is associated with tendon ruptures and tendinopathy. The other agents are not
associated with this adverse effect.
A 70-year-old woman with acute cystitis presents to the Family Medicine clinic for assessment. She has a
past medical history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease. The team recommends initiation of
nitrofurantoin for cystitis. After reviewing her antimicrobial therapy, which actions should be taken prior to
clinic discharge?
A.  Continue current therapy and counsel on gastrointestinal effects of nitrofurantoin.
B.  Change nitrofurantoin to alternative agent due to chronic kidney disease.
C.  Reduce nitrofurantoin dose due to impaired renal function.
D.  Counsel patient regarding neuropathy associated with short-term therapy.
Correct answer = B. The key issue with the antibiotic recommendation is that nitrofurantoin should not be
administered in patients with poor kidney function. Adjusting the dose and continuing the current regimen are not
acceptable modifications. Neuropathy is more common with therapy greater than 1 month.
Which recommendation should be provided to avoid phototoxicity associated with fluoroquinolone therapy?
A.  Use sunscreen and avoid excessive exposure to UV light.
B.  Take the medication at night to avoid high drug concentrations during the day.
C.  Take with food.
D.  Drink with 1 L of water per day to minimize drug buildup in skin tissue.
Correct answer = A. Patients taking a fluoroquinolone should apply sunscreen and take precautions to minimize
risk of phototoxicity. Adjusting the timing of the dose or taking with food or additional water does not change the
risk of an event.
What is the main benefit for prescribing methenamine for treatment of a urinary tract infection?
A.  Safe to use in patients with hepatic failure.
B.  Available in intravenous and oral formulations.
C.  Broad spectrum of activity.
D.  Minimal development of resistance.
Correct answer = D. Methenamine does not select for resistance. Due to its conversion to formaldehyde, this
compound is the least likely compound to select for resistant isolates. Methenamine should be avoided in patients
with hepatic failure. This agent is only available as an oral formulation, and it has a narrow spectrum of activity.

Antimycobacterial Drugs
Charles A. Peloquin and Eric F. Egelund
1185
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1186 ---

I.  Overview
Mycobacteria are rod-shaped aerobic bacilli that multiply slowly, every 18 to 24 hours in vitro. Their cell walls
contain mycolic acids, which give the genus its name. Mycolic acids are long-chain, β-hydroxylated fatty acids.
Mycobacteria produce highly lipophilic cell walls that stain poorly with Gram stain. Once stained, the bacilli are not
decolorized easily by acidified organic solvents. Hence, the organisms are called “acid-fast bacilli.” Mycobacterial
infections classically result in the formation of slow-growing, granulomatous lesions that cause tissue destruction
anywhere in the body.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis can cause latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and the disease known as
tuberculosis (TB). [Note: In LTBI, the patient is infected with M. tuberculosis  without signs or symptoms of active
TB disease.] TB is the leading infectious cause of death worldwide, and a quarter of the world’s population is
infected with TB. Increasing in frequency are diseases caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). These
species include M. avium-intracellulare , M. chelonae, M . abscessus, M . kansasii, and M . fortuitum . Finally, M.
leprae  causes leprosy.
TB treatment generally includes four first-line drugs (Figure 32.1). Second-line drugs are typically less effective,
more toxic, and less extensively studied. They are used for patients who cannot tolerate the first-line drugs or who
are infected with resistant TB. No drugs are specifically developed for NTM infections. Macrolides, rifamycins, and
aminoglycosides are frequently included, but NTM regimens vary widely by organism.
Figure 32.1 Summary of drugs used to treat mycobacterial infections.
1186

1187
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1188 ---

II.  Chemotherapy for Tuberculosis
M. tuberculosis  is slow growing and requires treatment for months to years. LTBI can be treated for 9 months with
isoniazid (INH) monotherapy or with 12 once-weekly higher doses of INH and rifapentine. In contrast, active TB
disease must be treated with several drugs. Treatment for drug-susceptible TB lasts for at least 6 months, while
treatment of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) typically lasts for about 2 years.
1188
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1189 ---

A.  Strategies for addressing drug resistance
Populations of M. tuberculosis  contain small numbers of organisms that are naturally resistant to a particular drug.
Under selective pressure from inadequate treatment, especially from monotherapy, these resistant organisms can
emerge as the dominant population. Figure 32.2 shows that resistance develops rapidly in TB patients given only
streptomycin. Multidrug therapy is employed to suppress these resistant organisms. The first-line drugs isoniazid,
rifampin, ethambutol , and pyrazinamide are preferred because of their high efficacy and acceptable incidence of
toxicity. Rifabutin or rifapentine may replace rifampin under certain circumstances. Active disease always requires
treatment with multidrug regimens, and preferably three or more drugs with proven in vitro activity against the
isolate. Although clinical improvement can occur in the first several weeks of treatment, therapy is continued much
longer to eradicate persistent organisms and to prevent relapse.
Figure 32.2 Cumulative percentage of strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis  showing
resistance to streptomycin.
Standard short-course chemotherapy for tuberculosis includes isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol , and pyrazinamide for
2 months (the intensive phase), followed by isoniazid and rifampin for 4 months (the continuation phase; Figure
32.3). Once susceptibility data are available, the drug regimen can be individually tailored. Second-line regimens for
MDR-TB (TB resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin) normally include an aminoglycoside (streptomycin,
kanamycin, or amikacin) or capreomycin (all injectable agents), a fluoroquinolone (typically levofloxacin or
moxifloxacin), any first-line drugs that remain active, and one or more of the following: cycloserine, ethionamide, or
p-aminosalicylic acid. For extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB), other drugs such as clofazimine and linezolid
may be employed empirically.

Figure 32.3 One of several recommended multidrug schedules for the treatment of
tuberculosis.
Patient adherence can be low when multidrug regimens last for 6 months or longer. One successful strategy for
achieving better treatment completion rates is directly observed therapy (DOT). Patients take the medications under
observation of a member of the health care team. DOT decreases drug resistance and improves cure rates. Most
public health departments offer DOT services.

--- PAGE 1191 ---

B.  Isoniazid
Isoniazid [eye-so-NYE-a-zid], along with rifampin, is one of the two most important TB drugs.
1.  Mechanism of action
Isoniazid is a prodrug activated by a mycobacterial catalase–peroxidase (KatG). Isoniazid targets the enzymes acyl
carrier protein reductase (InhA) and β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase (KasA), which are essential for the synthesis of
mycolic acid. Inhibiting mycolic acid leads to a disruption in the bacterial cell wall.
2.  Antibacterial spectrum
Isoniazid is specific for treatment of M. tuberculosis , although M. kansasii  may be susceptible at higher drug
concentrations. Most NTM are resistant to INH. The drug is particularly effective against rapidly growing bacilli and
is also active against intracellular organisms.
3.  Resistance
Resistance follows chromosomal mutations, including 1) mutation or deletion of KatG (producing mutants incapable
of prodrug activation), 2) varying mutations of the acyl carrier proteins, or 3) overexpression of the target enzyme
InhA. Cross-resistance may occur between isoniazid and ethionamide.
4.  Pharmacokinetics
Isoniazid is readily absorbed after oral administration. Absorption is impaired if isoniazid is taken with food,
particularly high-fat meals. The drug diffuses into all body fluids, cells, and caseous material (necrotic tissue
resembling cheese that is produced in tuberculous lesions). Drug concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are
similar to those in the serum. Isoniazid undergoes N-acetylation and hydrolysis, resulting in inactive products.
Isoniazid acetylation is genetically regulated, with fast acetylators exhibiting a 90-minute serum half-life, as
compared with 3 to 4 hours for slow acetylators (Figure 32.4). Excretion is through glomerular filtration and
secretion, predominantly as metabolites (Figure 32.5). Slow acetylators excrete more of the parent compound.

acetylation of the drug.
1191
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1192 ---

Figure 32.5 Administration and fate of isoniazid.
5.  Adverse effects
Hepatitis is the most serious adverse effect associated with isoniazid. If hepatitis goes unrecognized, and if isoniazid
is continued, it can be fatal. The incidence increases with age (greater than 35 years old), among patients who also
take rifampin, or among those who drink alcohol daily. Peripheral neuropathy, manifesting as paresthesia of the
hands and feet, appears to be due to a relative pyridoxine deficiency caused by isoniazid. This can be avoided by
daily supplementation of pyridoxine (vitamin B6). Central nervous system (CNS) adverse effects can occur,
including convulsions in patients prone to seizures. Hypersensitivity reactions with isoniazid include rashes and
fever. Because isoniazid inhibits the metabolism of carbamazepine and phenytoin (Figure 32.6), isoniazid can
potentiate the adverse effects of these drugs (for example, nystagmus and ataxia).
Figure 32.6 Isoniazid potentiates the adverse effects of phenytoin.

C.  Rifamycins: rifampin, rifabutin, and rifapentine
Rifampin, rifabutin, and rifapentine are all considered rifamycins, a group of structurally similar macrocyclic
antibiotics, which are first-line oral agents for tuberculosis.
1.  Rifampin
Rifampin [ri-FAM-pin] has broader antimicrobial activity than isoniazid and can be used as part of treatment for
several different bacterial infections. Because resistant strains rapidly emerge during monotherapy, it is never given
as a single agent in the treatment of active tuberculosis.
a.  Mechanism of action
Rifampin blocks RNA transcription by interacting with the β subunit of mycobacterial DNA-dependent RNA
polymerase.
b.  Antimicrobial spectrum
Rifampin is bactericidal for both intracellular and extracellular mycobacteria, including M. tuberculosis , and NTM,
such as M. kansasii  and Mycobacterium avium  complex (MAC). It is effective against many gram-positive and
gram-negative organisms and is used prophylactically for individuals exposed to meningitis caused by meningococci
or Haemophilus influenzae . Rifampin also is highly active against M. leprae .
c.  Resistance
Resistance to rifampin is caused by mutations in the affinity of the bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene
for the drug.
d.  Pharmacokinetics
Absorption is adequate after oral administration. Distribution of rifampin occurs to all body fluids and organs.
Concentrations attained in the CSF are variable, often 10% to 20% of blood concentrations. The drug is taken up by
the liver and undergoes enterohepatic recycling. Rifampin can induce hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes and
transporters (see Chapter 1), leading to numerous drug interactions. Unrelated to its effects on cytochrome P450
enzymes, rifampin undergoes autoinduction, leading to a shortened elimination half-life over the first 1 to 2 weeks
of dosing. Elimination of rifampin and its metabolites is primarily through the bile and into the feces; a small
percentage is cleared in the urine (Figure 32.7). [Note: Urine, feces, and other secretions have an orange-red color,
so patients should be forewarned. Tears may even stain soft contact lenses orange-red.]
Figure 32.7 Administration and fate of rifampin. [Note: Patient should be warned that
urine and tears may turn orange-red in color.]
e.  Adverse effects
1194
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1195 ---

Rifampin is generally well tolerated. The most common adverse reactions include nausea, vomiting, and rash.
Hepatitis and death due to liver failure are rare. However, the drug should be used judiciously in older patients,
alcoholics, or those with chronic liver disease. There is a modest increase in the incidence of hepatic dysfunction
when rifampin is coadministered with isoniazid and pyrazinamide. When rifampin is dosed intermittently, especially
with higher doses, a flu-like syndrome can occur, with fever, chills, and myalgia, sometimes extending to acute renal
failure, hemolytic anemia, and shock.
f.  Drug interactions
Because rifampin induces a number of phase I cytochrome P450 enzymes and phase II enzymes (see Chapter 1), it
can decrease the half-lives of coadministered drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes ( Figure 32.8). This may
necessitate higher dosages for coadministered drugs, a switch to drugs less affected by rifampin, or replacement of
rifampin with rifabutin.
Figure 32.8 Induces cytochrome P450, which can decrease the half-lives of
coadministered drugs that are metabolized by this system.
2.  Rifabutin
Rifabutin [rif-a-BYOO-tin], a derivative of rifampin, is preferred for TB patients coinfected with the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who are receiving protease inhibitors or several of the nonnucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors. Rifabutin is a less potent inducer (approximately 40% less) of cytochrome P450 enzymes,
thus lessening drug interactions. Rifabutin has adverse effects similar to those of rifampin but can also cause uveitis,
skin hyperpigmentation, and neutropenia.
3.  Rifapentine
Rifapentine [rih-fa-PEN-teen] has a longer half-life than that of rifampin. In combination with isoniazid, rifapentine
may be used once weekly in patients with LTBI and in select HIV-negative patients with minimal pulmonary TB.

D.  Pyrazinamide
Pyrazinamide [peer-a-ZIN-a-mide] is a synthetic, orally effective short-course agent used in combination with
isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol . The precise mechanism of action is unclear. Pyrazinamide must be
enzymatically hydrolyzed by pyrazinamidase to pyrazinoic acid, which is the active form of the drug. Some resistant
strains lack the pyrazinamidase enzyme. Pyrazinamide is active against tuberculosis bacilli in acidic lesions and in
macrophages. The drug distributes throughout the body, penetrating the CSF. Pyrazinamide may contribute to liver
toxicity. Uric acid retention is common, but rarely precipitates a gouty attack. Most of the clinical benefit from
pyrazinamide occurs early in treatment. Therefore, this drug is usually discontinued after 2 months of a 6-month
regimen.
1197
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1198 ---

E.  Ethambutol
Ethambutol  [e-THAM-byoo-tole] is bacteriostatic and specific for mycobacteria. Ethambutol  inhibits arabinosyl
transferase—an enzyme important for the synthesis of the mycobacterial cell wall. Ethambutol  is used in
combination with pyrazinamide, isoniazid, and rifampin pending culture and susceptibility data. [Note: Ethambutol
may be discontinued if the isolate is determined to be susceptible to isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide.]
Ethambutol  distributes well throughout the body. Penetration into the CNS is variable, and it is questionably
adequate for tuberculous meningitis. Both the parent drug and its hepatic metabolites are primarily excreted in the
urine. The most important adverse effect is optic neuritis, which results in diminished visual acuity and loss of
ability to discriminate between red and green. The risk of optic neuritis increases with higher doses and in patients
with renal impairment. Visual acuity and color discrimination should be tested prior to initiating therapy and
periodically thereafter. Uric acid excretion is decreased by ethambutol , and caution should be exercised in patients
with gout.

F.  Alternate second-line drugs
Streptomycin [strep-toe-MY-sin], para-aminosalicylic [a-mee-noe-sal-i-SIL-ik] acid, capreomycin [kap-ree-oh-
MYE-sin], cycloserine [sye-kloe-SER-een], ethionamide [e-thye-ON-am-ide], bedaquiline [bed-AK-wi-leen],
fluoroquinolones, and macrolides are second-line TB drugs. In general, these agents are less effective and more
toxic than the first-line agents. Figure 32.10 summarizes some of the characteristics of second-line drugs.
Figure 32.10 Some characteristics of second-line drugs used in treating tuberculosis.
BUN = blood urea nitrogen; CNS = central nervous system; CYP = cytochrome; G6PD =
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; GI = gastrointestinal; LFTs = liver function tests;
TSH = thyroid-stimulating hormone.
1.  Streptomycin
Streptomycin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic (see Chapter 30), was one of the first effective agents for TB. Its action
appears to be greater against extracellular organisms. Infections due to streptomycin-resistant organisms may be
treated with kanamycin or amikacin, to which these bacilli usually remain susceptible.
2.  Para-aminosalicylic acid
Para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) works via folic acid inhibition. While largely replaced by ethambutol  for drug-
susceptible TB, PAS remains an important component of many regimens for MDR-TB.
3.  Capreomycin
This is a parenterally administered polypeptide that inhibits protein synthesis similar to aminoglycosides.
Capreomycin is primarily reserved for the treatment of MDR-TB. Careful monitoring of renal function and hearing
is necessary to minimize nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, respectively.
4.  Cycloserine
Cycloserine is an orally effective, tuberculostatic drug that disrupts D-alanine incorporation into the bacterial cell
wall. It distributes well throughout body fluids, including the CSF. Cycloserine is primarily excreted unchanged in
urine. Accumulation occurs with renal insufficiency. Adverse effects involve CNS disturbances (for example,
lethargy, difficulty concentrating, anxiety, and suicidal tendency), and seizures may occur.
5.  Ethionamide
Ethionamide is a structural analog of isoniazid that also disrupts mycolic acid synthesis. The mechanism of action is
not identical to isoniazid, but there is some overlap in the resistance patterns. Ethionamide is widely distributed
throughout the body, including the CSF. Metabolism is extensive, most likely in the liver, to active and inactive
metabolites. Adverse effects that limit its use include nausea, vomiting, and hepatotoxicity. Hypothyroidism,
gynecomastia, alopecia, impotence, and CNS effects also have been reported.
6.  Fluoroquinolones
The fluoroquinolones (see Chapter 31), specifically moxifloxacin and levofloxacin, have an important place in the
treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Some NTM also are susceptible.
7.  Macrolides
The macrolides (see Chapter 30) azithromycin and clarithromycin are included in regimens for several NTM
infections, including MAC. Azithromycin may be preferred for patients at greater risk for drug interactions, since
clarithromycin is both a substrate and inhibitor of cytochrome P450 enzymes.1199
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1200 ---

8.  Bedaquiline
Bedaquiline, a diarylquinoline, is an ATP synthase inhibitor. It is approved for the treatment of MDR-TB.
Bedaquiline is administered orally, and it is active against many types of mycobacteria. Bedaquiline has a boxed
warning for QT prolongation, and monitoring of the electrocardiogram is recommended. Elevations in liver enzymes
have also been reported and liver function should be monitored during therapy. This agent is metabolized via
CYP3A4, and administration with strong CYP3A4 inducers (for example, rifampin) should be avoided.

III.  Drugs for Leprosy
Leprosy (or Hansen disease) is uncommon in the United States; however, worldwide, it is a much larger problem
(Figure 32.11). Leprosy can be treated effectively with dapsone and rifampin (Figure 32.12).

--- PAGE 1204 ---

A.  Dapsone
Dapsone [DAP-sone] is structurally related to the sulfonamides and similarly inhibits dihydropteroate synthase in
the folate synthesis pathway. It is bacteriostatic for M . leprae , and resistant strains may be encountered. Dapsone
also is used in the treatment of pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii  in immunosuppressed patients. The
drug is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is distributed throughout the body, with high concentrations
in the skin. The parent drug undergoes hepatic acetylation. Both parent drug and metabolites are eliminated in the
urine. Adverse reactions include hemolysis (especially in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
deficiency), methemoglobinemia, and peripheral neuropathy.
1204
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1205 ---

B.  Clofazimine
Clofazimine [kloe-FAZ-i-meen] is a phenazine dye. Its mechanism of action may involve binding to DNA, although
alternative mechanisms have been proposed. Its redox properties may lead to the generation of cytotoxic oxygen
radicals that are toxic to the bacteria. Clofazimine is bactericidal to M. leprae, and it has potentially useful activity
against M. tuberculosis  and NTM. The drug is recommended by the World Health Organization as part of a shorter
regimen (9 to 12 months) for MDR-TB. Following oral absorption, clofazimine accumulates in tissues, allowing
intermittent therapy but does not enter the CNS. Patients typically develop a pink to brownish-black discoloration of
the skin and should be informed of this in advance. Eosinophilic and other forms of enteritis, sometimes requiring
surgery, have been reported. Clofazimine has some anti-inflammatory and anti-immune activities. Thus, erythema
nodosum leprosum may not develop in patients treated with this drug.

32.5Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
A 22-year-old female intravenous drug user was admitted to the hospital with a 4-week history of cough and
fever. A chest radiograph showed left upper lobe cavitary infiltrate. Cultures of sputum yielded M.
tuberculosis  susceptible to all antimycobacterial drugs. The patient received self-administered isoniazid,
rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Two weeks following initiation of therapy, the patient is concerned
that her urine is a “funny-looking reddish color.” Which drug is the most likely cause?
A.  Isoniazid
B.  Rifampin
C.  Pyrazinamide
D.  Ethambutol
Correct answer = B. Rifampin (as well as rifabutin and rifapentine) and its metabolites may color urine, feces,
saliva, sputum, sweat, and tears a bright red-orange. Patients should be counseled that this is an adverse effect
which is not harmful, but can stain clothes and contact lenses.
A 32-year-old man has been on standard four-drug therapy for active pulmonary tuberculosis for the past 2
months. He has no other comorbid conditions. At his regular clinic visit, he complains of a “pins and
needles” sensation in his feet. Which drug is most likely causing this?
A.  Isoniazid
B.  Rifampin
C.  Pyrazinamide
D.  Ethambutol
Correct answer = A. Standard four-drug therapy for active pulmonary tuberculosis includes isoniazid. Isoniazid
can cause peripheral neuropathy with symptoms including paresthesias, such as “pins and needles” and
numbness.
A 32-year-old man who takes standard four-drug therapy for active pulmonary tuberculosis complains about
a “pins and needles” feeling in his feet. He is diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy. Which vitamin should
have been included in the regimen for this patient to reduce the risk of neuropathy?
A.  Niacin
B.  Pyridoxine
C.  Thiamine
D.  Ascorbic acid
Correct answer = B. Concurrent administration of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) prevents the neuropathic actions of
isoniazid. The relative deficiency of pyridoxine appears to be due to the interference of isoniazid with its
activation and enhancement of the excretion of pyridoxine.
A 23-year-old man was started on standard four-drug antimycobacterial therapy for treatment of active TB.
He has epilepsy, which is controlled with carbamazepine. He has had no seizures in 5 years; however, upon
return to clinic at 1 month, he reports having two seizures since his last visit. Which drug may be the reason
his carbamazepine is less effective?
A.  Isoniazid
B.  Rifampin
C.  Pyrazinamide
D.  Ethambutol
Correct answer = B. Rifampin is a potent inducer of cytochrome P450–dependent drug-metabolizing enzymes
and may reduce the concentration of carbamazepine. None of the other drugs listed induce cytochrome P450
enzymes.
A 26-year-old female HIV patient was recently diagnosed with active tuberculosis. Currently, she is on a
stable HIV regimen consisting of two protease inhibitors and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.
Which is the most appropriate regimen for treatment of her tuberculosis?
A.  Rifampin + isoniazid + pyrazinamide + ethambutol
B.  Rifabutin + isoniazid + pyrazinamide + ethambutol
C.  Rifapentine + isoniazid + pyrazinamide + ethambutol
D.  Rifampin + moxifloxacin + pyrazinamide + ethambutol
Correct answer = B. Rifabutin is recommended in place of rifampin in patients coinfected with HIV, since it is a
less potent inducer of CYP enzymes than rifampin. However, rifabutin is a CYP3A4 substrate and “bidirectional”
interactions may result. That is, other medications, such as the protease inhibitors, may affect the concentration of
rifabutin, requiring dose adjustment of rifabutin or use of alternative HIV agents.1206

32.10A 28-year-old man with MDR-TB is receiving the following medications for treatment: pyrazinamide,
ethionamide, moxifloxacin, streptomycin, and para-aminosalicylic acid. Which drug in his regimen requires
monitoring for QT prolongation?
A.  Pyrazinamide
B.  Ethionamide
C.  Moxifloxacin
D.  Streptomycin
Correct answer = C. While rare, prolongation of the QT interval is associated with the fluoroquinolones. QT
interval prolongation is due to the blocking of voltage-gated potassium channels. Of the available quinolones,
moxifloxacin has the greatest risk. The risk may be minimized by avoiding coadministration of other medications,
which may prolong the QT interval. The other agents are not associated with QT prolongation.
A 46-year-old male patient with active tuberculosis is to be initiated on the four-drug regimen of isoniazid,
rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. The patient reports no other conditions except gout. Which pair of
antituberculosis drugs has the potential to worsen his gout?
A.  Rifampin and isoniazid
B.  Ethambutol and pyrazinamide
C.  Rifampin and ethambutol
D.  Isoniazid and ethambutol
Correct answer = B. Ethambutol and especially pyrazinamide both may increase uric acid concentrations and
have the potential to precipitate gouty attacks. Pyrazinamide- and ethambutol-induced hyperuricemia may be
controlled by use of antigout medications, such as xanthine oxidase inhibitors. Symptoms of gout must be
monitored closely.
A 24-year-old man returns to the clinic 1 month after starting treatment for tuberculosis. He is receiving
isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. He states that he feels fine, but now is having difficulty
reading and feels he may need to get glasses. Which drug may be causing his decline in vision?
A.  Isoniazid
B.  Rifampin
C.  Pyrazinamide
D.  Ethambutol
Correct answer = D. Optic neuritis, exhibited as a decrease in visual acuity or loss of color discrimination, is the
most important side effect associated with ethambutol. Visual disturbances generally are dose related and more
common in patients with reduced renal function. They are reversible (weeks to months) if ethambutol is
discontinued promptly.
A 36-year-old woman with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is being treated with the following agents:
streptomycin, cycloserine, pyrazinamide, ethionamide, and p-aminosalicylic acid. Her physician recently
noticed that she appears confused and anxious, and has a slight tremor. Which drug is most likely
contributing to her current state?
A.  Streptomycin
B.  Cycloserine
C.  Pyrazinamide
D.  Ethionamide
Correct answer = B. Cycloserine easily penetrates the CNS and may cause adverse effects involving the nervous
system, including psychoses, drowsiness, tremor, paresthesia, aggression, and suicidal ideation, among others.
Patients should be monitored continually for these signs and symptoms.
Which is correct regarding clofazimine in the treatment of leprosy?
A.  Clofazimine should not be used in patients with a deficiency in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD).
B.  Peripheral neuropathy is one of the most common adverse effects seen with the drug.
C.  Clofazimine may cause skin discoloration over time.
D.  The risk of erythema nodosum leprosum is increased in patients given clofazimine.
Correct answer = C. Clofazimine is a phenazine dye and causes bronzing (the skin pigment color will change
color, from pink to brownish-black), especially in fair-skinned patients. This occurs in a majority of patients, and
generally is not considered harmful but may take several months to years to fade after discontinuing the
medication.1207

I.  Overview
Infectious diseases caused by fungi are called mycoses, and they are often chronic in nature. Mycotic infections may
involve only the skin (cutaneous mycoses extending into the epidermis), or may cause subcutaneous or systemic
infections. Unlike bacteria, fungi are eukaryotic, with rigid cell walls composed largely of chitin rather than
peptidoglycan (a characteristic component of most bacterial cell walls). In addition, the fungal cell membrane
contains ergosterol rather than the cholesterol found in mammalian membranes. These structural characteristics are
useful targets for chemotherapeutic agents against mycoses. Fungi are generally resistant to antibiotics; conversely,
bacteria are resistant to antifungal agents. The incidence of mycoses such as candidemia has been on the rise for the
last few decades. This is attributed to an increased number of patients with chronic immune suppression due to
organ transplantation, cancer chemotherapy, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Simultaneously,
new therapeutic options have become available for the treatment of mycoses. Figure 33.1 summarizes clinically
useful agents for cutaneous and systemic mycoses. Figure 33.2 lists the common pathogenic organisms of the
Kingdom Fungi, and Figure 33.3 provides an overview of the mechanism of action of the various antifungal agents.

A.  Amphotericin B
Amphotericin [am-foe-TER-i-sin] B is a naturally occurring polyene antifungal produced by Streptomyces nodosus .
In spite of its toxic potential, amphotericin B  remains the drug of choice for the treatment of several life-threatening
mycoses.
1.  Mechanism of action
Amphotericin B  binds to ergosterol in the plasma membranes of fungal cells. There, it forms pores (channels) that
require hydrophobic interactions between the lipophilic segment of the polyene antifungal and the sterol (Figure
33.4). The pores disrupt membrane function, allowing electrolytes (particularly potassium) and small molecules to
leak from the cell, resulting in cell death.
Figure 33.4 Model of a pore formed by amphotericin B in the lipid bilayer membrane.
2.  Antifungal spectrum
Amphotericin B  is either fungicidal or fungistatic, depending on the organism and the concentration of the drug. It is
effective against a wide range of fungi, including Candida albicans , Histoplasma capsulatum , Cryptococcus
neoformans , Coccidioides immitis , Blastomyces dermatitidis , and many strains of Aspergillus . [Note: Amphotericin
B is also used in the treatment of the protozoal infection leishmaniasis.]
3.  Resistance
Fungal resistance to amphotericin B , although infrequent, is associated with decreased ergosterol content of the
fungal membrane.
4.  Pharmacokinetics
Amphotericin B  is administered by slow intravenous (IV) infusion (Figure 33.5). Amphotericin B  is insoluble in
water and must be coformulated with sodium deoxycholate (conventional) or artificial lipids to form liposomes. The
liposomal preparations are associated with reduced renal and infusion toxicity but are more costly. Amphotericin B
is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is distributed throughout the body. Inflammation favors penetration into
various body fluids, but little of the drug is found in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), vitreous humor, peritoneal fluid,1214
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1215 ---

or synovial fluid. Low levels of the drug and its metabolites are excreted primarily in the urine over a long period of
time.
Figure 33.5 Administration and fate of amphotericin B. CSF = cerebrospinal fluid.
5.  Adverse effects
Amphotericin B  has a low therapeutic index. Toxic manifestations are outlined below (Figure 33.6).
1215
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1216 ---

Figure 33.6 Adverse effects of amphotericin B.
a.  Fever and chills
These occur most commonly 1 to 3 hours after starting the IV administration but usually subside with repeated
administration of the drug. Premedication with a corticosteroid or an antipyretic helps to prevent this problem.
b.  Renal impairment
1216
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1217 ---

Despite the low levels of the drug excreted in the urine, patients may exhibit a decrease in glomerular filtration rate
and renal tubular function. Serum creatinine may increase, creatinine clearance can decrease, and potassium and
magnesium are lost. Renal function usually returns with discontinuation of the drug, but residual damage is likely at
high doses. Azotemia is exacerbated by other nephrotoxic drugs, such as aminoglycosides, cyclosporine, and
vancomycin, although adequate hydration can decrease its severity. Sodium loading with infusions of normal saline
prior to administration of the conventional formulation or use of the liposomal amphotericin B  products minimizes
the risk of nephrotoxicity.
c.  Hypotension
A shock-like fall in blood pressure accompanied by hypokalemia may occur, requiring potassium supplementation.
Care must be exercised in patients taking digoxin and other drugs that can cause potassium fluctuations.
d.  Thrombophlebitis
Adding heparin to the infusion can alleviate this problem.

--- PAGE 1218 ---

B.  Antimetabolite antifungals
Flucytosine [floo-SYE-toe-seen] (5-FC) is a synthetic pyrimidine antimetabolite that is often used in combination
with other antifungal agents.
1.  Mechanism of action
5-FC  enters the fungal cell via a cytosine-specific permease, an enzyme not found in mammalian cells. It is
subsequently converted to a series of compounds, including 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine 5′-
monophosphate, which disrupt nucleic acid and protein synthesis (Figure 33.7). [Note: Amphotericin B  increases cell
permeability, allowing more 5-FC  to penetrate the cell leading to synergistic effects.]

monophosphate; dTMP = deoxythymidine 5′-monophosphate.
1219
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1220 ---

2.  Antifungal spectrum
5-FC  is fungistatic. It is effective in combination with itraconazole for treating chromoblastomycosis. It is also used
in combination with amphotericin B  for the treatment of systemic mycoses and for meningitis caused by C.
neoformans  and C. albicans . Flucytosine can also be used for Candida  urinary tract infections when fluconazole is
not appropriate; however, resistance can occur with repeated use.
3.  Resistance
Resistance may occur due to decreased levels of any of the enzymes in the conversion of 5-FC  to 5-FU and other
metabolites. The emergence of resistant fungal cells is lower with a combination of 5-FC  plus a second antifungal
agent. Thus, 5-FC  is not used as a single antimycotic drug.
4.  Pharmacokinetics
5-FC  is well absorbed after oral administration. It distributes throughout the body water and penetrates well into the
CSF. 5-FU is detectable in patients and is probably the result of metabolism of 5-FC  by intestinal bacteria. Excretion
of both the parent drug and metabolites is via glomerular filtration, and the dose must be adjusted in patients with
compromised renal function.
5.  Adverse effects
5-FC  causes reversible neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and dose-related bone marrow depression. Reversible
hepatic dysfunction with elevation of serum transaminases has been observed. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are
common, and severe enterocolitis may occur.

C.  Azole antifungals
Azole antifungals are made up of two different classes of drugs—imidazoles and triazoles. Although these drugs
have similar mechanisms of action and spectra of activity, their pharmacokinetics and therapeutic uses vary
significantly. In general, imidazoles are applied topically for cutaneous infections, whereas triazoles are
administered systemically for the treatment or prophylaxis of cutaneous and systemic mycoses. [Note: Imidazole
antifungals are discussed in the section on agents for cutaneous mycotic infections.] The systemic triazole
antifungals include fluconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, and isavuconazole.
1.  Mechanism of action
Azoles are predominantly fungistatic. They inhibit 14-α demethylase (a cytochrome P450 [CYP450] enzyme),
thereby blocking the demethylation of lanosterol to ergosterol (Figure 33.8). The inhibition of ergosterol
biosynthesis disrupts fungal membrane structure and function, which, in turn, inhibits fungal cell growth.
Figure 33.8 Mode of action of azole antifungals.
2.  Resistance
Resistance to azole antifungals is becoming a significant clinical problem, particularly with protracted therapy
required in immunocompromised patients, such as those who have advanced HIV infection or bone marrow
transplant. Mechanisms of resistance include mutations in the 14-α demethylase gene that lead to decreased azole
binding and efficacy. Additionally, some strains of fungi develop efflux pumps that pump the drug out of the cell or
have reduced ergosterol in the cell wall.
3.  Drug interactions
All azoles inhibit the hepatic CYP450 3A4 isoenzyme to varying degrees. Patients on concomitant medications that
are substrates for this isoenzyme may have increased concentrations and risk for toxicity. Several azoles, including
itraconazole and voriconazole, are metabolized by CYP450 3A4 and other CYP450 isoenzymes. Therefore,
concomitant use of potent CYP450 inhibitors (for example, ritonavir) and inducers (for example, rifampin,
phenytoin) can lead to increased adverse effects or clinical failure of these azoles, respectively.
4.  Contraindications
Azoles are considered teratogenic, and they should be avoided in pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs
the risk to the fetus.

D.  Fluconazole
Fluconazole [floo-KON-a-zole] was the first triazole antifungal agent. It is the least active of all triazoles, with most
of its spectrum limited to yeasts and some dimorphic fungi. It has no role in the treatment of aspergillosis or
zygomycosis. It is highly active against Cryptococcus neoformans and certain species of Candida , including C.
albicans  and C. parapsilosis . Resistance is a concern, however, with other species, including C. krusei  and C.
glabrata . Fluconazole is used for prophylaxis against invasive fungal infections in recipients of bone marrow
transplants. It is the drug of choice for Cryptococcus neoformans  after induction therapy with amphotericin B  and
flucytosine and is used for the treatment of candidemia and coccidioidomycosis. Fluconazole is effective against
most forms of mucocutaneous candidiasis. It is commonly used as a single-dose oral treatment for vulvovaginal
candidiasis. Fluconazole is available in oral and IV dosage formulations. It is well absorbed after oral administration
and distributes widely to body fluids and tissues. The majority of the drug is excreted unchanged via the urine, and
doses must be reduced in patients with renal dysfunction. The most common adverse effects with fluconazole are
nausea, vomiting, headache, and skin rashes.
1223

--- PAGE 1224 ---

E.  Itraconazole
Itraconazole [it-ra-KON-a-zole] is a synthetic triazole that has a broad antifungal spectrum compared to fluconazole.
Itraconazole is a drug of choice for the treatment of blastomycosis, sporotrichosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, and
histoplasmosis. It is rarely used for treatment of infections due to Candida  and Aspergillus  species because of the
availability of more effective agents. Itraconazole is available as a capsule, tablet, or oral solution. The capsule and
tablet should be taken with food, and ideally an acidic beverage, to increase absorption. By contrast, the solution
should be taken on an empty stomach, as food decreases the absorption. The drug distributes well in most tissues,
including bone and adipose tissues. Itraconazole is extensively metabolized by the liver, and the drug and inactive
metabolites are excreted in the urine and feces. Adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, rash (especially in
immunocompromised patients), hypokalemia, hypertension, edema, and headache. Liver toxicity can also occur,
especially when given with other hepatotoxic drugs. Itraconazole has a negative inotropic effect and should be
avoided in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction, such as heart failure.
1224

--- PAGE 1225 ---

F.  Posaconazole
Posaconazole [poe-sa-KONE-a-zole], a synthetic triazole, is a broad-spectrum antifungal structurally similar to
itraconazole. It is available as an oral suspension, oral tablet, or IV formulation. Posaconazole is commonly used for
the treatment and prophylaxis of invasive Candida  and Aspergillus  infections in severely immunocompromised
patients. Because of its broad spectrum of activity, posaconazole is used in the treatment of invasive fungal
infections caused by Scedosporium  and Zygomycetes . The drug has low oral bioavailability and should be given
with food. Unlike other azoles, posaconazole is not metabolized by CYP450, but is eliminated via glucuronidation.
Drugs that increase gastric pH (for example, proton pump inhibitors) may decrease the absorption of oral
posaconazole and should be avoided if possible. Due to its potent inhibition of CYP450 3A4, concomitant use of
posaconazole with a number of agents (for example, ergot alkaloids, atorvastatin, citalopram, and risperidone) is
contraindicated.
1225

--- PAGE 1226 ---

G.  Voriconazole
Voriconazole [vor-i-KON-a-zole], a synthetic triazole related to fluconazole, is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent
that is available in both IV and oral dosage forms. Voriconazole has replaced amphotericin B  as the drug of choice
for invasive aspergillosis. It is also approved for treatment of invasive candidiasis, as well as serious infections
caused by Scedosporium  and Fusarium  species. Voriconazole has high oral bioavailability and penetrates into tissues
well. It is extensively metabolized by CYP450 2C19, 2C9, and 3A4 isoenzymes, and the metabolites are primarily
excreted via the urine. Inhibitors and inducers of these isoenzymes may impact levels of voriconazole, leading to
toxicity or clinical failure, respectively. Voriconazole displays nonlinear kinetics, which can be affected by drug
interactions and pharmacogenetic variability, particularly CYP450 2C19 polymorphisms. High trough
concentrations have been associated with visual and auditory hallucinations and an increased incidence of
hepatotoxicity. Voriconazole is also an inhibitor of CYP2C19, 2C9, and 3A4 isoenzymes. Drugs that are substrates
of these isoenzymes are impacted by voriconazole (Figure 33.9). Because of significant interactions, use of
voriconazole is contraindicated with many drugs (for example, rifampin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, and St. John’s
wort).
Figure 33.9 By inhibiting cytochrome P450, voriconazole can potentiate the toxicities of
other drugs.

H.  Isavuconazole
Isavuconazole [eye-sa-voo-KON-a-zole] is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent, which is supplied as the prodrug
isavuconazonium in IV and oral dosage forms. Isavuconazonium is rapidly hydrolyzed by esterases in the blood to
isavuconazole. Isavuconazole has a spectrum of activity similar to voriconazole and is approved for invasive
aspergillosis and invasive mucormycosis. Isavuconazonium has high bioavailability after oral administration and
distributes well into tissues. The drug is metabolized by CYP450 3A4/5 and uridine diphosphate-
glucuronosyltransferases. Coadministration of isavuconazole with potent CYP450 3A4 inhibitors and inducers is
contraindicated. Isavuconazole is also an inhibitor of the CYP450 3A4 isoenzyme, thereby increasing the
concentrations of drugs that are substrates of CYP450 3A4. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and hypokalemia are
common adverse effects.

I.  Echinocandins
Echinocandins interfere with the synthesis of the fungal cell wall by inhibiting the synthesis of β(1,3)-D-glucan,
leading to lysis and cell death. Caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin are available for IV administration once
daily. Micafungin is the only echinocandin that does not require a loading dose. The echinocandins have potent
activity against Aspergillus  and most Candida  species, including those species resistant to azoles. However, they
have minimal activity against other fungi. The most common adverse effects are fever, rash, nausea, and phlebitis at
the infusion site. They should be administered via a slow IV infusion, as they can cause a histamine-like reaction
(flushing) when infused rapidly.
1.  Caspofungin
Caspofungin [kas-poh-FUN-jin] is a first-line option for patients with invasive candidiasis, including candidemia,
and a second-line option for invasive aspergillosis in patients who have failed or cannot tolerate amphotericin B  or
an azole. The dose of caspofungin should be adjusted with moderate hepatic dysfunction. Concomitant
administration of caspofungin with CYP450 enzyme inducers (for example, rifampin) may require an increase in
caspofungin dose. Caspofungin should not be coadministered with cyclosporine due to a high incidence of elevated
hepatic transaminases with concurrent use.
2.  Micafungin and anidulafungin
Micafungin [mi-ka-FUN-jin] and anidulafungin [ay-nid-yoo-la-FUN-jin] are first-line options for the treatment of
invasive candidiasis, including candidemia. Micafungin is also indicated for the prophylaxis of invasive Candidainfections in patients who are undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. These agents are not substrates
for CYP450 enzymes and do not have any associated drug interactions.

III.  Drugs for Cutaneous Mycotic Infections
Mold-like fungi that cause cutaneous infections are called dermatophytes or tinea. Tinea infections are classified by
the affected site (for example, tinea pedis, which refers to an infection of the feet). Common dermatomycoses, such
as tinea infections that appear as rings or round red patches with clear centers, are often referred to as “ringworm.”
This is a misnomer because fungi rather than worms cause the disease. The three different fungi that cause the
majority of cutaneous infections are Trichophyton, Microsporum , and Epidermophyton . The drugs used in the
treatment of cutaneous mycoses are listed in Figure 33.1.
1230
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1231 ---

A.  Squalene epoxidase inhibitors
These agents act by inhibiting squalene epoxidase, thereby blocking the biosynthesis of ergosterol, an essential
component of the fungal cell membrane (Figure 33.12). Accumulation of toxic amounts of squalene results in
increased membrane permeability and death of the fungal cell.
Figure 33.12 Mode of action of squalene epoxidase inhibitors.
1.  Terbinafine
Oral terbinafine [TER-bin-a-feen] is the drug of choice for treating dermatophyte onychomycoses (fungal infections
of nails). It is better tolerated, requires a shorter duration of therapy, and is more effective than either itraconazole or
griseofulvin for Trichophyton . Therapy is prolonged (usually about 3 months) but considerably shorter than that
with griseofulvin. Oral terbinafine may also be used for tinea capitis (infection of the scalp). [Note: Oral antifungal
therapy (griseofulvin, terbinafine, itraconazole) is needed for tinea capitis. Topical antifungals are ineffective.]
Topical terbinafine (1% cream, gel or solution) is used to treat tinea pedis, tinea corporis (ringworm), tinea cruris
(infection of the groin or “jock itch”), and tinea versicolor due to Malassezia furfur . Duration of treatment is usually
1 week.
a.  Antifungal spectrum
Terbinafine is active against Trichophyton . It may also be effective against Candida , Epidermophyton , and
Scopulariopsis , but the efficacy in treating clinical infections due to these pathogens has not been established.
b.  Pharmacokinetics
Terbinafine is available for oral and topical administration. The bioavailability after oral administration is only 40%
due to first-pass metabolism. Terbinafine is highly protein bound and is deposited in the skin, nails, and adipose
tissue. A prolonged terminal half-life of 200 to 400 hours may reflect the slow release from these tissues. Oral
terbinafine is extensively metabolized by several CYP450 isoenzymes and is excreted mainly via the urine (Figure
33.13). The drug should be avoided in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment or hepatic dysfunction.
Terbinafine is an inhibitor of the CYP450 2D6 isoenzyme, and concomitant use with substrates of CYP450 2D6
may result in an increased risk of adverse effects with those agents.

Figure 33.13 Administration and fate of terbinafine.
c.  Adverse effects
Common adverse effects include diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, headache, and rash. Taste and visual disturbances have
been reported, as well as elevations in serum hepatic transaminases.
2.  Naftifine
Naftifine [NAF-ti-feen] is active against Trichophyton , Microsporum , and Epidermophyton . Naftifine cream and gel
are used for topical treatment of tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea pedis. Duration of treatment is usually 2 to 4
weeks.
3.  Butenafine
Butenafine [byoo-TEN-a-feen] is active against Trichophyton rubrum , Epidermophyton , and Malassezia . Like
naftifine, butenafine cream is used for topical treatment of tinea infections.

B.  Griseofulvin
Griseofulvin [gris-ee-oh-FUL-vin] causes disruption of the mitotic spindle and inhibition of fungal mitosis ( Figure
33.14). It has been largely replaced by oral terbinafine for the treatment of onychomycosis, although it is still used
for dermatophytosis of the scalp and hair. Griseofulvin is fungistatic and requires a long duration of treatment (for
example, 6 to 12 months for onychomycosis). Duration of therapy is dependent on the rate of replacement of healthy
skin and nails. Ultrafine crystalline preparations are absorbed adequately from the gastrointestinal tract, and
absorption is enhanced by high-fat meals. The drug concentrates in skin, hair, nails, and adipose tissue. Griseofulvin
induces hepatic CYP450 activity, which increases the rate of metabolism of a number of drugs, including
anticoagulants. The use of griseofulvin is contraindicated in pregnancy and patients with porphyria.

C.  Nystatin
Nystatin [nye-STAT-in] is a polyene antifungal, and its structure, chemistry, mechanism of action, and resistance
profile resemble those of amphotericin B. It is used for the treatment of cutaneous and oral Candida  infections. The
drug is negligibly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and it is not used parenterally due to systemic toxicity
(acute infusion-related adverse effects and nephrotoxicity). It is administered as an oral agent (“swish and swallow”
or “swish and spit”) for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis (thrush), intravaginally for vulvovaginal
candidiasis, or topically for cutaneous candidiasis.

D.  Imidazoles
Imidazoles are azole derivatives, which currently include butoconazole [byoo-toe-KON-a-zole], clotrimazole [kloe-
TRIM-a-zole], econazole [ee-KON-a-zole], ketoconazole [kee-toe-KON-a-zole], miconazole [my-KON-a-zole],
oxiconazole [oks-i-KON-a-zole], sertaconazole [ser-ta-KON-a-zole], sulconazole [sul-KON-a-zole], terconazole
[ter-KON-a-zole], and tioconazole [tee-oh-KON-a-zole]. As a class of topical agents, they have a wide range of
activity against Epidermophyton , Microsporum , Trichophyton , Candida , and Malassezia , depending on the agent.
The topical imidazoles have a variety of uses, including tinea corporis, tinea cruris, tinea pedis, and oropharyngeal
and vulvovaginal candidiasis. Topical use is associated with contact dermatitis, vulvar irritation, and edema.
Clotrimazole is also available as a troche (lozenge), and miconazole is available as a buccal tablet for the treatment
of thrush. Oral ketoconazole is rarely used today due to the risk of severe liver injury, adrenal insufficiency, and
adverse drug interactions.

F.  Ciclopirox
Ciclopirox [sye-kloe-PEER-oks], a pyridine antimycotic, inhibits the transport of essential elements in the fungal
cell, disrupting the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and proteins. Ciclopirox is active against Trichophyton ,
Epidermophyton , Microsporum , Candida , and Malassezia . It is available in a number of formulations. Ciclopirox
shampoo is used for treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. Tinea pedis, tinea corporis, tinea cruris, cutaneous
candidiasis, and tinea versicolor may be treated with the cream, gel, or suspension. Onychomycosis can be treated
with the nail lacquer formulation.

Choose the ONE best answer.
Which antifungal agent is MOST likely to cause renal insufficiency?
A.  Fluconazole
B.  Amphotericin B
C.  Itraconazole
D.  Posaconazole
Correct answer = B. Amphotericin B is the best choice since nephrotoxicity is commonly associated with this
medication. Although the dose of fluconazole must be adjusted for renal insufficiency, it is not associated with
causing nephrotoxicity. Itraconazole and posaconazole are metabolized by the liver and are not associated with
nephrotoxicity.
A 55-year-old woman presents to the hospital with shortness of breath, fever, and malaise. She has a history
of breast cancer and is receiving chemotherapy. Her chest x-ray shows pneumonia, and respiratory cultures
are positive for Aspergillus fumigatus. Which is the MOST appropriate choice for treatment?
A.  Voriconazole
B.  Fluconazole
C.  Flucytosine
D.  Ketoconazole
Correct answer = A. Voriconazole is the drug of choice for aspergillosis. Studies have found it to be superior to
other regimens including amphotericin B. Fluconazole, flucytosine, and ketoconazole do not have reliable in vitro
activity and are therefore not recommended.
Which antifungal agent should be avoided in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction?
A.  Micafungin
B.  Itraconazole
C.  Terbinafine
D.  Posaconazole
Correct answer = B. There is a black box warning that warns against the use of itraconazole in patients with
evidence of ventricular dysfunction, including patients with heart failure.
A 56-year-old woman with diabetes complains of thickening of the nail of the right big toe and a change in
color (yellow). The podiatrist diagnoses the patient with onychomycosis of the toenails. Which is the most
appropriate choice for treating this infection?
A.  Terbinafine
B.  Micafungin
C.  Itraconazole
D.  Griseofulvin
Correct answer = A. Terbinafine is better tolerated, requires a shorter duration of therapy, and is more effective
than either itraconazole or griseofulvin. Micafungin is not active for this type of infection.
A 44-year-old man presents to clinic with fevers and chills, headaches, and shortness of breath. He reports
that he was exploring caves about 5 weeks ago. He is diagnosed with mild/moderate acute pulmonary
histoplasmosis. Which is the most appropriate choice for treating this infection?
A.  Micafungin
B.  Itraconazole
C.  Terbinafine
D.  Griseofulvin
Correct answer = B. Itraconazole is the treatment of choice in patients with mild/moderate acute pulmonary
histoplasmosis who have had symptoms for more than 1 month. Micafungin, terbinafine, and griseofulvin are not
active for this type of infection.
A 32-year-old HIV-positive woman is admitted to the hospital with severe confusion and dizziness. She has
been nonadherent with her HIV medications for several months. She is diagnosed with meningitis caused by
Cryptococcus neoformans. Which is the most appropriate choice for treating the infection in this patient?
A.  Anidulafungin alone
B.  Amphotericin B plus flucytosine
C.  Flucytosine alone
D.  Isavuconazole plus anidulafungin
Correct answer = B. The treatment of choice for initial therapy for cryptococcal meningitis is the combination of1240

33.10amphotericin B and flucytosine. Flucytosine should not be given alone because of the rapid development of
resistance. Anidulafungin is not active against this type of infection. Isavuconazole has not been studied for the
treatment of cryptococcal meningitis.
A 22-year-old woman reports a cottage cheese–like vaginal discharge and slight dysuria for 1 week. The
patient is diagnosed with vulvovaginal candidiasis. She requests as short a course of treatment as possible
due to her busy schedule. Which antifungal is the best choice?
A.  Oral fluconazole
B.  Topical miconazole
C.  Oral terbinafine
D.  Topical efinaconazole
Correct answer = A. Oral fluconazole can be given as a one-time dose for vulvovaginal candidiasis. Topical
miconazole requires multiple days of therapy. Terbinafine and efinaconazole are not used clinically for
vulvovaginal candidiasis.
Which drug is relatively free of drug–drug interactions?
A.  Voriconazole
B.  Itraconazole
C.  Micafungin
D.  Terbinafine
Correct answer = C. The echinocandins (including micafungin) are not metabolized by the CYP450 enzyme
system, so they have very few drug–drug interactions. Voriconazole, itraconazole, and terbinafine are all
metabolized by the CYP450 enzyme system, so they have significant drug–drug interactions.
Which drug works by creating pores/channels in the fungal cell membrane?
A.  Fluconazole
B.  Anidulafungin
C.  Amphotericin B
D.  Flucytosine
Correct answer = C. Amphotericin B creates pores/channels in the fungal cell membrane. Fluconazole works by
inhibiting the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol. Anidulafungin inhibits the synthesis of β- D-glucan.
Flucytosine disrupts nucleic acid and protein synthesis.
Which drug requires a loading dose?
A.  Caspofungin
B.  Micafungin
C.  Liposomal amphotericin B
D.  Tavaborole

I.  Overview
Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites. They lack both a cell wall and a cell membrane, and they do not carry out
metabolic processes. Viruses use much of the metabolic machinery of the host, and few drugs are selective enough
to prevent viral replication without injury to the infected host cells. Therapy for viral diseases is further complicated
by the fact that clinical symptoms appear late in the course of the disease, at a time when most of the virus particles
have replicated. At this stage of viral infection, administration of drugs that block viral replication has limited
effectiveness in many cases. However, a few virus groups respond to available antiviral drugs, and some antiviral
agents are useful as prophylactic agents. These agents are discussed in this chapter. To assist in the review of these
drugs, they are grouped according to the type of viral infection they target (Figure 34.1).

II.  Treatment of Respiratory Viral Infections
Viral respiratory tract infections for which treatments exist include influenza A and B and respiratory syncytial virus
(RSV). [Note: Immunization against influenza is the preferred approach. However, antiviral agents are used when
patients are allergic to the vaccine or outbreaks occur.]

A.  Neuraminidase inhibitors
The neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir [os-el-TAM-i-veer] and zanamivir [za-NA-mi-veer] are effective against
both type A and type B influenza viruses. They do not interfere with the immune response to influenza vaccine.
Administered prior to exposure, neuraminidase inhibitors prevent infection and, when administered within 24 to 48
hours after the onset of symptoms, they modestly decrease the intensity and duration of symptoms.
1.  Mechanism of action
Influenza viruses employ a specific neuraminidase that is inserted into the host cell membrane for the purpose of
releasing newly formed virions. This enzyme is essential for the virus life cycle. Oseltamivir and zanamivir
selectively inhibit neuraminidase, thereby preventing the release of new virions and their spread from cell to cell.
2.  Pharmacokinetics
Oseltamivir is an orally active prodrug that is rapidly hydrolyzed by the liver to its active form. Zanamivir is not
active orally and is administered via inhalation. Both drugs are eliminated unchanged in the urine (Figure 34.2).
Figure 34.2 Administration and fate of oseltamivir and zanamivir.
3.  Adverse effects
The most common adverse effects of oseltamivir are gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort and nausea, which can be
alleviated by taking the drug with food. Irritation of the respiratory tract occurs with zanamivir. It should be used
with caution in individuals with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, because bronchospasm may
occur.
4.  Resistance
Mutations of the neuraminidase enzyme have been identified in adults treated with either of the neuraminidase
inhibitors. These mutants, however, are often less infective and virulent than the wild type.

ta-deen], is limited to influenza A infections. Due to widespread resistance, the adamantanes are not recommended
in the United States for the treatment or prophylaxis of influenza A.

C.  Ribavirin
Ribavirin [rye-ba-VYE-rin], a synthetic guanosine analog, is effective against a broad spectrum of RNA and DNA
viruses. For example, ribavirin is used in the treatment of immunosuppressed infants and young children with severe
RSV infections. Ribavirin is also effective in chronic hepatitis C infections when used in combination with other
direct-acting antivirals (DAAs).
1.  Mechanism of action
Ribavirin inhibits replication of RNA and DNA viruses. The drug is first phosphorylated to the 5′-phosphate
derivatives. The major product ribavirin triphosphate exerts its antiviral action by inhibiting guanosine triphosphate
formation, preventing viral messenger RNA (mRNA) capping, and blocking RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
2.  Pharmacokinetics
Ribavirin is effective orally and by inhalation. An aerosol is used in the treatment of RSV infection. Absorption is
increased if the oral drug is taken with a fatty meal. The drug and its metabolites are eliminated in urine ( Figure
34.3).
Figure 34.3 Administration and fate of ribavirin.
3.  Adverse effects
Adverse effects of ribavirin include dose-dependent transient anemia. Elevated bilirubin has also been reported. The
aerosol may be safer, although respiratory function in infants can deteriorate quickly after initiation of aerosol
treatment. Therefore, monitoring is essential. Ribavirin is contraindicated in pregnancy (Figure 34.4).

III.  Treatment of Hepatic Viral Infections
The hepatitis viruses currently identified (A, B, C, D, and E) each have a pathogenesis, which specifically involves
replication in and destruction of hepatocytes. Of this group, hepatitis B (a DNA virus) and hepatitis C (an RNA
virus) are the most common causes of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma ( Figure 34.5) and
are the only hepatic viral infections for which therapy is currently available. [Note: Hepatitis A is a commonly
encountered infection caused by oral ingestion of the virus, but it is not a chronic disease.] Chronic hepatitis B may
be treated with peginterferon-α-2a [peg-in-ter-FEER-on AL-fa], which is injected subcutaneously once weekly. Oral
therapy for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) includes lamivudine [la-MIV-yoo-deen], adefovir [a-DEF-o-veer],
entecavir [en-TEK-a-vir], and tenofovir [ten-OF-oh-vir] (see Section VIII for tenofovir). The preferred treatment for
chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a combination of DAAs, the selection of which is based on the hepatitis C
genotype. In certain cases, ribavirin is added to a DAA regimen to enhance virologic response. With the
introduction of new DAAs, pegylated interferon-α  is no longer commonly used in HCV, and it is not recommended
in current guidelines due to inferior efficacy and poor tolerability.

A.  Interferons
Interferons are a family of naturally occurring, inducible glycoproteins that interfere with the ability of viruses to
infect cells. The interferons are synthesized by recombinant DNA technology. At least three types of interferons
exist—α, β, and γ (Figure 34.6). In “pegylated” formulations, bis-monomethoxy polyethylene glycol has been
covalently attached to interferon-α  to increase the size of the molecule. The larger molecular size delays absorption
from the injection site, lengthens the duration of action of the drug, and also decreases its clearance.
Figure 34.6 Some approved indications for interferon.
1.  Mechanism of action
The antiviral mechanism is incompletely understood. It appears to involve the induction of host cell enzymes that
inhibit viral RNA translation, ultimately leading to the degradation of viral mRNA and tRNA.
2.  Therapeutic uses
Peginterferon alfa-2a is approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection. It is also indicated for the treatment of
HCV in combination with other agents, although use is uncommon due to availability of more effective agents.
3.  Adverse effects
These include flu-like symptoms, such as fever, chills, myalgias, arthralgias, and GI disturbances. Fatigue and
mental depression are common. The principal dose-limiting toxicities are bone marrow suppression, severe fatigue
and weight loss, neurotoxicity characterized by somnolence and behavioral disturbances, autoimmune disorders
such as thyroiditis and, rarely, cardiovascular problems such as heart failure.

--- PAGE 1255 ---

B.  Lamivudine
This cytosine analog is an inhibitor of both hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
reverse transcriptases (RTs). Lamivudine must be phosphorylated by host cellular enzymes to the triphosphate
(active) form. This compound competitively inhibits HBV RNA-dependent DNA polymerase. As with many
nucleotide analogs, the intracellular half-life of the triphosphate is many hours longer than its plasma half-life. The
rate of HBV resistance is high following long-term therapy with lamivudine and, therefore, lamivudine is no longer
recommended in current hepatitis B guidelines.
1255
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1256 ---

C.  Adefovir
Adefovir is a nucleotide analog that is phosphorylated by cellular kinases to adefovir diphosphate, which is then
incorporated into viral DNA. This leads to termination of chain elongation and prevents replication of HBV.
Adefovir is administered once daily and is renally excreted via glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. As with
other agents, discontinuation of adefovir may result in severe exacerbation of hepatitis. Nephrotoxicity may occur
with chronic use, and the drug should be used cautiously in patients with existing renal dysfunction. Adefovir is no
longer recommended in current hepatitis B guidelines due to lower efficacy compared to other agents.
1256
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1257 ---

D.  Entecavir
Entecavir is a guanosine nucleoside analog for the treatment of HBV infection. Following intracellular
phosphorylation to the triphosphate, it competes with the natural substrate, deoxyguanosine triphosphate, for viral
RT. Entecavir is effective against lamivudine-resistant strains of HBV and is dosed once daily. The drug is primarily
excreted unchanged in the urine and dosage adjustments are needed in renal dysfunction. Concomitant use of drugs
with renal toxicity should be avoided.
1257

--- PAGE 1258 ---

V.  Treatment of Hepatitis C
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) enters the hepatocyte following interaction with cellular entry factors. Once inside the cell,
a viral genome is released from the nucleocapsid and an HCV polyprotein is translated using the internal ribosome
entry site. The polyprotein is then cleaved by cellular and viral proteases to yield structural and nonstructural
proteins. The core NS3 and NS5A proteins form the replication complex on lipid droplets and serve as a scaffold for
RNA polymerase to replicate the viral genome, which is then packaged in envelope glycoproteins before
noncytolytic secretion of mature virions. Several direct-acting antiviral agents targeting the NS3/NS4A protease,
NS5B polymerase, and NS5A involved in HCV replication and assembly are available.
Combination therapy with DAAs is necessary to optimize HCV treatment response rates. Current combinations
employ multiple DAAs that target different stages of the HCV life cycle simultaneously ( Figure 34.7). With
combination therapy, the agents are collectively able to suppress both wild-type and drug-resistant viral populations.
Certain combinations may have different efficacy based on the genotype of HCV. It is anticipated that additional
agents will be available in the near future. For a summary of current guidelines and regimens recommended in
specific scenarios, see www.hcvguidelines.org.

virus. HCV = hepatitis C virus.

A.  NS3/NS4A protease inhibitors
The viral NS3/NS4A serine protease is crucial for processing the single polyprotein encoded by HCV RNA into
individually active proteins, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B. Without these serine proteins, RNA replication does
not occur and the HCV life cycle is effectively disrupted. Paritaprevir [PAR-i-TAP-re-vir] (which requires ritonavir
[rit-OH-na-vir] boosting), grazoprevir [graz-OH-pre-vir], voxilaprevir [VOX-i-LA-pre-vir], and glecaprevir [glec-
A-pre-vir] are DAAs that inhibit the NS3/NS4A serine protease as their primary mechanism of action. [Note: HCV
protease inhibitors often have the ending “-previr.”] These drugs have a lower barrier to resistance than other agents,
such as sofosbuvir. Use of HCV protease inhibitors presents significant potential for drug–drug interactions due to
their metabolism by CYP3A enzymes. Adverse effects of NS3/NS4A protease inhibitors include rash, pruritus,
nausea, fatigue, and anemia.
1259
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1260 ---

B.  NS5B polymerase inhibitors
NS5B is the sole RNA polymerase responsible for HCV replication and is processed with other HCV proteins into
an individual polypeptide by the viral NS3/NS4A serine protease. There are two types of NS5B RNA polymerase
inhibitors—nucleoside/nucleotide analogues that compete for the enzyme active site and nonnucleoside analogues
that target allosteric sites. Sofosbuvir [soe-FOS-bue-vir] is currently the only NS5B nucleotide polymerase inhibitor
for the treatment of HCV infection, and dasabuvir [da-SAB-ue-vir] is the only nonnucleoside analogue. [Note:
NS5B inhibitors often end in “-buvir.”] NS5B polymerase inhibitors are well tolerated with few adverse effects.
1260
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1261 ---

C.  NS5A replication complex inhibitors
NS5A is a viral protein that is essential for HCV RNA replication and assembly. Its role in replication appears to be
the formation of a membranous web along with viral protein NS4B, and this web provides a platform for replication.
The currently available NS5A inhibitors include ledipasvir [le-DIP-as-vir], ombitasvir [om-BIT-as-vir], elbasvir
[ELB-as-vir], velpatasvir [vel-PAT-as-vir], pibrentasvir [pi-BRENT-as-vir], and daclatasvir [dak-LAT-as-vir].
[Note: NS5A inhibitors often in “-asvir.”] With the exception of daclatasvir, these agents are all coformulated with
other direct-acting antivirals (see Figure 34.7). NS5A inhibitors have a number of clinically significant drug
interactions due to their metabolism by hepatic CYP450 isoenzymes and inhibition of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). For
example, daclatasvir is extensively metabolized via hepatic CYP3A4 enzymes, and the drug is contraindicated in
combination with strong CYP3A4 inducers because of the potential for reduced efficacy. In addition, the dose of
daclatasvir should be decreased when coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and increased when
coadministered with moderate CYP3A4 inducers. Absorption of ledipasvir is reduced when gastric pH is increased.
Patients receiving proton pump inhibitors should either stop these agents during HCV therapy with ledipasvir or
take the proton pump inhibitor with ledipasvir-containing regimens under fasted conditions to ensure that gastric pH
is at its lowest point at the time of drug administration.

D.  Ribavirin
Ribavirin is approved for the treatment of chronic HCV when used in combination with standard or pegylated
interferon or with DAAs. Ribavirin, a guanosine analogue, improves viral clearance, decreases relapse rates, and
improves rates of sustained virologic response when used in combination with other agents. The addition of
ribavirin to DAA-based regimens is based on HCV genotype/subtype, cirrhosis status, mutational status, and
treatment history. Despite its use in patients with HCV for more than 20 years, the precise mechanism(s) by which
ribavirin improves outcomes is unknown. Ribavirin remains an important component of HCV therapy, even in the
age of DAA therapy. Whether use of ribavirin will be necessary with future DAAs is not known. The dose of
ribavirin is always weight-based, and it is administered in two daily divided doses with food.

VI.  Treatment of Herpes Virus Infections
Herpes viruses are associated with a broad spectrum of diseases, for example, cold sores, viral encephalitis, and
genital infections. The drugs that are effective against these viruses exert their actions during the acute phase of viral
infections and are without effect during the latent phase.
1263
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1264 ---

A.  Acyclovir
Acyclovir [ay-SYE-kloe-veer] is the prototypic antiherpetic therapeutic agent. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1
and 2, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and some Epstein-Barr virus–mediated infections are sensitive to acyclovir. It is
the treatment of choice in HSV encephalitis. The most common use of acyclovir is in therapy for genital herpes
infections. It is also given prophylactically to seropositive patients before bone marrow transplant and post-heart
transplant to protect such individuals from herpetic infections.
1.  Mechanism of action
Acyclovir, a guanosine analog, is monophosphorylated in the cell by the herpesvirus-encoded enzyme thymidine
kinase (Figure 34.8). Therefore, virus-infected cells are most susceptible. The monophosphate analog is converted to
the di- and triphosphate forms by the host cell kinases. Acyclovir triphosphate competes with deoxyguanosine
triphosphate as a substrate for viral DNA polymerase and is itself incorporated into the viral DNA, causing
premature DNA chain termination.

--- PAGE 1266 ---

Figure 34.8 Incorporation of acyclovir into replicating viral DNA, causing chain
termination. dGTP = deoxyguanosine triphosphate.
2.  Pharmacokinetics
Acyclovir is administered by intravenous (IV), oral, or topical routes. [Note: The efficacy of topical applications is
questionable.] The drug distributes well throughout the body, including the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Acyclovir is
partially metabolized to an inactive product. Excretion into the urine occurs both by glomerular filtration and tubular
secretion (Figure 34.9). Acyclovir accumulates in patients with renal failure. The valyl ester, valacyclovir [val-a-
SYE-kloe-veer], has greater oral bioavailability than acyclovir. This ester is rapidly hydrolyzed to acyclovir and
achieves levels of the latter comparable to those of acyclovir following IV administration.
Figure 34.9 Administration and fate of acyclovir. IV = intravenous.
3.  Adverse effects
Adverse effects of acyclovir treatment depend on the route of administration. For example, local irritation may occur
from topical application; headache, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting may result after oral administration. Transient
renal dysfunction may occur at high doses or in a dehydrated patient receiving the drug intravenously.
4.  Resistance
Altered or deficient thymidine kinase and DNA polymerases have been found in some resistant viral strains and are
most commonly isolated from immunocompromised patients. Cross-resistance to the other agents in this family
occurs.
1266
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1267 ---

B.  Cidofovir
Cidofovir [si-DOE-foe-veer] is indicated for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in patients with
AIDS. [Note: CMV is a member of the herpesvirus family.] Cidofovir is a nucleotide analog of cytosine, the
phosphorylation of which is not dependent on viral or cellular enzymes. It inhibits viral DNA synthesis. Slow
elimination of the active intracellular metabolite permits prolonged dosage intervals and eliminates the permanent
venous access needed for ganciclovir therapy. Cidofovir is administered intravenously. Cidofovir produces
significant renal toxicity (Figure 34.10), and it is contraindicated in patients with preexisting renal impairment and in
those taking nephrotoxic drugs. Neutropenia and metabolic acidosis also occur. Oral probenecid and IV normal
saline are coadministered with cidofovir to reduce the risk of nephrotoxicity. Since the introduction of highly active
antiretroviral therapy, the prevalence of CMV infections in immunocompromised hosts has markedly declined, as
has the importance of cidofovir in the treatment of these patients.

C.  Foscarnet
Unlike most antiviral agents, foscarnet  [fos-KAR-net] is not a purine or pyrimidine analog. Instead, it is a
pyrophosphate derivative and does not require activation by viral (or cellular) kinases. Foscarnet  is approved for
CMV retinitis in immunocompromised hosts and for acyclovir-resistant HSV infections. Foscarnet  works by
reversibly inhibiting viral DNA and RNA polymerases, thereby interfering with viral DNA and RNA synthesis.
Mutation of the polymerase structure is responsible for resistant viruses. Foscarnet  is poorly absorbed orally and
must be injected intravenously. It must also be given frequently to avoid relapse when plasma levels fall. It is
dispersed throughout the body, and greater than 10% enters the bone matrix, from which it slowly disperses. The
parent drug is eliminated by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion (Figure 34.11). Adverse effects include
nephrotoxicity, anemia, nausea, and fever. Due to chelation with divalent cations, hypocalcemia and
hypomagnesemia are also seen. In addition, hypokalemia, hypo- and hyperphosphatemia, seizures, and arrhythmias
have been reported.

D.  Ganciclovir
Ganciclovir [gan-SYE-kloe-veer] is an analog of acyclovir that has greater activity against CMV. It is used for the
treatment of CMV retinitis in immunocompromised patients and for CMV prophylaxis in transplant patients.
1.  Mechanism of action
Like acyclovir, ganciclovir is activated through conversion to the nucleoside triphosphate by viral and cellular
enzymes. The nucleotide inhibits viral DNA polymerase and can be incorporated into the DNA resulting in chain
termination.
2.  Pharmacokinetics
Ganciclovir is administered IV and distributes throughout the body, including the CSF. Excretion into the urine
occurs through glomerular filtration and tubular secretion ( Figure 34.12). Like acyclovir, ganciclovir accumulates in
patients with renal failure. Valganciclovir [val-gan-SYE-kloe-veer], an oral drug, is the valyl ester of ganciclovir.
Like valacyclovir, valganciclovir has high oral bioavailability, because rapid hydrolysis in the intestine and liver
after oral administration leads to high levels of ganciclovir.
Figure 34.12 Administration and fate of ganciclovir.
3.  Adverse effects
Adverse effects include severe, dose-dependent neutropenia. Ganciclovir is carcinogenic as well as teratogenic and
carries a boxed warning for use in pregnancy.
4.  Resistance
Resistant CMV strains have been detected that have lower levels of ganciclovir triphosphate.

--- PAGE 1270 ---

E.  Penciclovir and famciclovir
Penciclovir [pen-SYE-kloe-veer] is an acyclic guanosine nucleoside derivative that is active against HSV-1, HSV-2,
and VZV. Penciclovir is administered topically (Figure 34.13). It is monophosphorylated by viral thymidine kinase,
and cellular enzymes form the nucleoside triphosphate, which inhibits HSV DNA polymerase. Penciclovir
triphosphate has an intracellular half-life much longer than acyclovir triphosphate. Penciclovir is negligibly
absorbed upon topical application and is well tolerated. Famciclovir [fam-SYE-kloe-veer], another acyclic analog of
2′-deoxyguanosine, is a prodrug that is metabolized to the active penciclovir. The antiviral spectrum is similar to that
of ganciclovir, and it is approved for treatment of acute herpes zoster, genital HSV infection, and recurrent herpes
labialis. The drug is effective orally (Figure 34.13). Adverse effects include headache and nausea.

--- PAGE 1271 ---

F.  Trifluridine
Trifluridine [trye-FLURE-i-deen] is a fluorinated pyrimidine nucleoside analog that is structurally similar to
thymidine. Once converted to the triphosphate, the agent is believed to inhibit the incorporation of thymidine
triphosphate into viral DNA and, to a lesser extent, lead to the synthesis of defective DNA that renders the virus
unable to replicate. Trifluridine is active against HSV-1, HSV-2, and vaccinia virus. It is indicated for treatment of
HSV keratoconjunctivitis and recurrent epithelial keratitis. Because the triphosphate form of trifluridine can also
incorporate to some degree into cellular DNA, the drug is too toxic for systemic use. Therefore, the use of
trifluridine is restricted to a topical ophthalmic preparation. A short half-life necessitates that the drug be applied
frequently. Adverse effects include a transient irritation of the eye and palpebral (eyelid) edema.

VII.  Treatment of HIV Infection
Prior to approval of zidovudine [zye-DOE-vyoo-deen] in 1987, treatment of HIV infections focused on decreasing
the occurrence of opportunistic infections that caused a high degree of morbidity and mortality in AIDS patients.
Today, the viral life cycle is understood (Figure 34.15), and a combination of drugs is used to suppress replication of
HIV and restore the number of CD4 cells and immunocompetence to the host. This multidrug regimen is commonly
referred to as antiretroviral therapy, or ART (Figure 34.16). There are five classes of antiretroviral drugs, each of
which targets one of the four viral processes. These classes of drugs are nucleoside and nucleotide reverse
transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs),
entry inhibitors, and the integrase inhibitors. There are also two pharmacokinetic enhancers, also known as
“boosters,” which lack anti-HIV activity themselves, but rather serve to increase drug levels of concomitantly
administered antiretroviral agents and allow for less frequent dosing and less variation in drug levels. Initial therapy
for HIV consists of a combination of two NRTIs with an integrase inhibitor, an NNRTI, or a boosted PI. Selection of
the appropriate combination is based on 1) avoidance of the use of two agents of the same nucleoside analog; 2)
avoidance of overlapping toxicities and genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of the virus; 3) patient factors, such
as disease symptoms and concurrent illnesses; 4) impact of drug interactions; and 5) ease of adherence to the
regimen. The goals of therapy are to maximally and durably suppress HIV RNA replication, to restore and preserve
immunologic function, to reduce HIV-related morbidity and mortality, and to improve quality of life.

VIII.  NRTIs Used to Treat HIV Infection
1277
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1278 ---

A.  Overview of NRTIs
NRTIs were the first agents available to treat HIV infection, and currently, the use of two NRTIs is a mainstay of
most initial antiretroviral regimens. Available NRTIs include zidovudine, lamivudine, emtricitabine [em-trye-SYE-
ta-been], tenofovir, didanosine [dye-DAN-oh-seen], stavudine [STA-vue-deen], and abacavir [a-BAK-a-veer]. The
most commonly used NRTIs are tenofovir, abacavir, emtricitabine, and lamivudine, and these NRTIs are
recommended parts of initial regimens for most patients with HIV. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in combination
with emtricitabine can also be used for preexposure prophylaxis in individuals at high risk for HIV acquisition.
1.  Mechanism of action
These agents are inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase. NRTIs are analogs of native ribosides (nucleosides or
nucleotides containing ribose), which all lack a 3′-hydroxyl group. Once they enter cells, they are phosphorylated by
cellular enzymes to the corresponding triphosphate analog, which is preferentially incorporated into the viral DNA
by RT. Because the 3′-hydroxyl group is not present, a 3′,5′-phosphodiester bond between an incoming nucleoside
triphosphate and the growing DNA chain cannot be formed, and DNA chain elongation is terminated. Affinities of
the drugs for many host cell DNA polymerases are lower than they are for HIV RT, although mitochondrial DNA
polymerase γ appears to be susceptible at therapeutic concentrations.
2.  Pharmacokinetics
All of the NRTIs are administered orally. [Note: Zidovudine is also available as an intravenous formulation.]
Tenofovir is available in two different salt forms as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and tenofovir alafenamide
(TAF); both prodrugs of tenofovir. The tenofovir prodrug is converted by lymphoid cellular enzymes to tenofovir
diphosphate, which is the active form of the drug and an inhibitor of HIV RT. TAF achieves improved anti-HIV
activity at lower doses than TDF, resulting in a five- to sevenfold increase in intracellular diphosphate in the
lymphoid cell and in lower circulating plasma tenofovir levels. Because of this, TAF has fewer adverse effects (renal
insufficiency and loss of bone mineral density) than TDF. The NRTIs are primarily renally excreted, and all require
dosage adjustment in renal insufficiency except abacavir, which is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase and
glucuronyl transferase.
3.  Adverse effects
Many toxicities of the NRTIs are believed to be due to inhibition of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase in certain
tissues. As a general rule, the dideoxynucleosides, such as didanosine and stavudine, have a greater affinity for the
mitochondrial DNA polymerase, leading to toxicities such as peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis, and lipoatrophy.
Because of these mitochondrial toxicities, didanosine and stavudine are rarely used in current antiretroviral
regimens. When more than one NRTI is given, care is taken to avoid overlapping toxicities. All NRTIs have been
associated with potentially fatal liver toxicity characterized by lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis.
Abacavir is associated with a hypersensitivity reaction, which affects approximately 5% of patients and is usually
characterized by drug fever, plus a rash, GI symptoms, malaise, or respiratory distress (Figure 34.17). Sensitized
individuals should never be rechallenged with abacavir because of rapidly appearing, severe reactions that may lead
to death. A genetic test (HLA-B*5701) is available to screen patients for the potential of this reaction. Figure 34.18
shows some adverse reactions commonly seen with nucleoside analogs.
1278
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1279 ---

Figure 34.17 Hypersensitivity reactions to abacavir.
Figure 34.18 Some adverse reactions of nucleoside analogs.
4.  Drug interactions
Due to the renal excretion of the NRTIs, there are not many drug interactions encountered with these agents except
for zidovudine and tenofovir.
5.  Resistance
NRTI resistance is well characterized, and the most common resistance pattern is a mutation at viral RT codon 184,
which confers a high degree of resistance to lamivudine and emtricitabine but, more importantly, restores sensitivity
to zidovudine and tenofovir. Because cross-resistance and antagonism occur between agents of the same analog class
(thymidine, cytosine, guanosine, and adenosine), concomitant use of agents with the same analog target is
contraindicated (for example, zidovudine and stavudine are both analogs of thymidine and should not be used
together).

--- PAGE 1280 ---

IX.  NNRTIs Used to Treat HIV Infection
NNRTIs are highly selective, noncompetitive inhibitors of HIV RT. They bind to HIV RT at an allosteric
hydrophobic site adjacent to the active site, inducing a conformational change that results in enzyme inhibition.
They do not require activation by cellular enzymes. These drugs have common characteristics that include cross-
resistance with other NNRTIs, drug interactions, and a high incidence of hypersensitivity reactions, including rash.
The NNRTIs include nevirapine [ne-VYE-ra-peen], delavirdine [de-LA-vir-deen], efavirenz [e-FA-veer-enz],
etravirine [et-ra-VYE-rine], and rilpivirine [ril-pi-VIR-een]. Efavirenz (Figure 34.19) and rilpivirine are
recommended in initial antiretroviral regimens in certain clinical situations. For example, efavirenz is safe to use in
patients co-infected with tuberculosis because of its lower potential for drug interactions with rifamycins, and
rilpivirine has the smallest tablet size, making it ideal for patients with difficulty swallowing. Etravirine is a second-
generation NNRTI active against many HIV strains that are resistant to the first-generation NNRTIs; its use is
limited to HIV treatment–experienced, multidrug-resistant patients who have evidence of ongoing viral replication.
Delavirdine and nevirapine are rarely used due to toxicities and/or inferior antiviral efficacy.

X.  Protease Inhibitors Used to Treat HIV Infection
Inhibitors of HIV protease have significantly altered the course of this devastating viral disease. Shortly after their
introduction, the number of deaths in the United States due to AIDS decreased and continues to remain on the
decline (Figure 34.20). Available PIs include atazanavir (ATV), darunavir (DRV) [da-ROON-a-veer],
fosamprenavir (FPV) [FOS-am-PREN-a-veer], indinavir (IDV) [in-DIN-a-veer], lopinavir (LPV) [loe-PIN-a-vir],
nelfinavir (NFV) [nel-FIN-a-veer], saquinavir (SQV) [sa-KWIN-a-veer], and tipranavir (TPV) [tip-RA-na-veer].
However, current HIV guidelines only list a select few (for example, atazanavir or darunavir) due to improved
adverse effect profile, virologic efficacy, and ease of dosing. Due to their high genetic barrier to resistance, protease
inhibitors are recommended in initial regimens in certain clinical situations (for example, patients with uncertain
adherence or when resistance testing results are not yet available).

A.  Overview
These potent agents have several common features that characterize their pharmacology.
1.  Mechanism of action
Drugs in this group are reversible inhibitors of the HIV aspartyl protease (retropepsin), which is the viral enzyme
responsible for cleavage of the viral polyprotein into a number of essential enzymes (RT, protease, and integrase)
and several structural proteins. The inhibition prevents maturation of the viral particles and results in the production
of noninfectious virions.
2.  Pharmacokinetics
High-fat meals substantially increase the bioavailability of some PIs, such as nelfinavir and saquinavir, whereas the
bioavailability of indinavir is decreased, and others are essentially unaffected. The HIV PIs are all substantially
bound to plasma proteins. These agents are substrates for the CYP3A4 isoenzyme, and individual PIs are also
metabolized by other CYP450 isoenzymes. Metabolism is extensive, and very little drug is excreted unchanged in
urine.
3.  Adverse effects
PIs commonly cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (Figure 34.21). Disturbances in glucose and lipid metabolism
also occur, including diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypercholesterolemia. Chronic administration results in fat
redistribution, including loss of fat from the extremities, fat accumulation in the abdomen and the base of the neck
(“buffalo hump”; Figure 34.22), and breast enlargement. These physical changes may indicate to others that an
individual is HIV infected.

Figure 34.22 Accumulation of fat at the base of the neck in a patient receiving a protease
inhibitor.
4.  Drug interactions
Drug interactions are a common problem for PIs, because they are substrates and also potent inhibitors of CYP450
isoenzymes. Drugs that rely on metabolism for their termination of action may accumulate to toxic levels. Examples
of potentially dangerous interactions with PIs include rhabdomyolysis from simvastatin or lovastatin, excessive
sedation from midazolam or triazolam, and respiratory depression from fentanyl  (Figure 34.23). Other drug
interactions that require dosage modification and cautious use include warfarin, sildenafil, and phenytoin (Figure
34.24). In addition, inducers of CYP450 isoenzymes may decrease PI plasma concentrations to suboptimal levels,
contributing to treatment failures. Thus, drugs such as rifampin and St. John's wort  are also contraindicated with PIs.

Figure 34.24 Drugs that require dose modifications or cautious use with any protease
inhibitor.
5.  Resistance
Resistance occurs as an accumulation of stepwise mutations of the protease gene. Initial mutations result in
decreased ability of the virus to replicate, but as the mutations accumulate, virions with high levels of resistance to
the protease inhibitors emerge. Suboptimal concentrations of PI result in the more rapid appearance of resistant
strains.

--- PAGE 1287 ---

B.  Atazanavir
Atazanavir is well absorbed after oral administration. It must be taken with food to increase absorption and
bioavailability. Atazanavir requires an acidic environment for absorption. Thus, unboosted atazanavir is
contraindicated with concurrent use of proton pump inhibitors, and administration must be spaced apart from H2-
blockers and antacids. Atazanavir can be boosted by ritonavir or cobicistat . The drug is highly protein bound and
undergoes extensive metabolism by CYP3A4 isoenzymes. It is excreted primarily in bile. It has a half-life of about 7
hours, but it may be administered once daily. Atazanavir is a competitive inhibitor of glucuronyl transferase, and
benign hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice are known adverse effects. In addition, the drug may prolong the PR
interval. Atazanavir exhibits a decreased risk of hyperlipidemia compared with other PIs.
1287

--- PAGE 1288 ---

C.  Darunavir
Darunavir [da-RU-na-veer] is coadministered with cobicistat  or a low dose of ritonavir. Darunavir is approved for
initial therapy in treatment-naive HIV-infected patients, as well as for treatment-experienced patients with HIV
resistant to other PIs. Darunavir must be taken with food to increase absorption. The elimination half-life is 15
hours when combined with ritonavir. Darunavir is extensively metabolized by the CYP3A enzymes and is also an
inhibitor of the CYP3A4 isoenzyme. Adverse effects are similar to those of the other PIs. In addition, darunavir
therapy has been associated with a rash.
A summary of PIs is presented in Figure 34.25.

XI.  Entry Inhibitors
1291
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1292 ---

A.  Enfuvirtide
Enfuvirtide [en-FYOO-vir-tide] is a fusion inhibitor. For HIV to gain entry into the host cell, it must fuse its
membrane with that of the host cell. This is accomplished by changes in the conformation of the viral
transmembrane glycoprotein gp41, which occurs when HIV binds to the host cell surface. Enfuvirtide is a
polypeptide that binds to gp41, preventing the conformational change. Enfuvirtide, in combination with other
antiretroviral agents, is indicated for therapy of treatment-experienced patients with evidence of viral replication
despite ongoing antiretroviral drug therapy. As a peptide, it must be given subcutaneously. Most of the adverse
effects are related to the injection, including pain, erythema, induration, and nodules, which occur in almost all
patients. Enfuvirtide must be reconstituted prior to administration.
1292
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1293 ---

B.  Maraviroc
Maraviroc [ma-RAV-i-rok] is an entry inhibitor that blocks the CCR5 coreceptor that works with gp41 to facilitate
HIV entry through the membrane into the cell. HIV may express preference for either the CCR5 coreceptor or the
CXCR4 coreceptor, or both (dual-tropic). Prior to use of maraviroc, a test to determine viral tropism is required to
distinguish whether the strain of HIV virus uses the CCR5 coreceptor, the CXCR4 coreceptor, or is dual-tropic.
Only strains of HIV that use CCR5 to gain access to the cell can be successfully treated with maraviroc. The drug is
well absorbed after oral administration. Maraviroc is metabolized mainly by the hepatic CYP3A isoenzyme, and the
dose must be reduced when given with most PIs or strong CYP450 inhibitors. Conversely, it should be increased in
patients receiving efavirenz, etravirine, or strong CYP450 inducers. Maraviroc is generally well tolerated. The drug
has been associated with severe hepatotoxicity, which may be preceded by a fever or rash. Monitoring of liver
function is recommended.
1293
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1294 ---

XII.  Integrase Inhibitors
Raltegravir [ral-TEG-ra-veer], elvitegravir [el-vi-TEG-ra-vir], dolutegravir [doe-loo-TEG-ra-vir], and bictegravir
[bik-TEG-ra-vir] are integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), often called integrase inhibitors. These agents
work by inhibiting the insertion of proviral DNA into the host cell genome. The active site of the integrase enzyme
binds to the host cell DNA and includes two divalent metal cations that serve as chelation targets for the INSTIs. As
a result, when an INSTI is present, the active site of the enzyme is occupied and the integration process is halted.
The half-life of elvitegravir is 3 hours when administered alone, but increases to approximately 9 hours when
boosted by cobicistat . Pharmacokinetic boosting of elvitegravir allows once-daily dosing with food. The INSTIs are
generally well tolerated, with nausea and diarrhea being the most commonly reported adverse effects. Importantly,
INSTIs are subject to chelation interactions with antacids, resulting in significant reductions in bioavailability.
Therefore, INSTI doses should be separated from antacids and other polyvalent cations by several hours. Resistance
to INSTIs occurs with single-point mutations within the integrase gene. Cross-resistance between raltegravir and
elvitegravir can occur, although dolutegravir has limited cross-resistance to other INSTIs.

XIII.  Pharmacokinetic Enhancers
1295
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1296 ---

A.  Ritonavir
Ritonavir [ri-TOE-na-veer] is no longer used as a single PI but, instead, is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer or
“booster” of other PIs. Ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A, and concomitant ritonavir administration at low
doses increases the bioavailability of the second PI, often allowing for longer dosing intervals. The resulting higher
Cmin levels of the “boosted” PI also help to prevent the development of HIV resistance. Therefore, “boosted” PIs are
recommended for use in initial HIV regimens in certain clinical situations. Metabolism by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6
and biliary excretion are the primary methods of elimination. Ritonavir has a half-life of 3 to 5 hours. Although
ritonavir is primarily an inhibitor of CYP450 isoenzymes, it may also induce several CYP450 isoenzymes, and
numerous drug interactions have been identified.
1296
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1297 ---

B.  Cobicistat
Cobicistat  [koe-BIK-i-stat] is a pharmacokinetic enhancer or booster drug used in combination treatments for HIV.
This agent inhibits CYP3A isoenzymes and is used to enhance the bioavailability of the protease inhibitors
atazanavir and darunavir, and the integrase inhibitor elvitegravir. Because cobicistat  inhibits CYP3A, CYP2D6,
and the transporter P-gp, numerous drug interactions exist. Cobicistat  may also cause elevations in serum creatinine
due to inhibition of tubular creatinine secretion.

34.6Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
A 30-year-old man with human immunodeficiency virus infection is being treated with an antiretroviral
regimen. Four weeks after initiating therapy, he presents to the emergency department complaining of fever,
rash, and gastrointestinal upset. His HLA-B*5701 test is positive. Which drug is most likely the cause of his
symptoms?
A.  Zidovudine
B.  Abacavir
C.  Efavirenz
D.  Darunavir
Correct answer = B. The abacavir hypersensitivity reaction is characterized by fever, rash, and gastrointestinal
upset. The patient must stop therapy and should not be rechallenged with abacavir.
A 75-year-old man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is diagnosed with suspected influenza based
on complaints of flu-like symptoms that began 24 hours ago. Which agent is most appropriate to initiate for
the treatment of influenza?
A.  Oseltamivir
B.  Zanamivir
C.  Rimantadine
D.  Amantadine
Correct answer = A. Oseltamivir is the best choice since it is administered orally and not associated with
resistance. Zanamivir is administered via inhalation and is not recommended for patients with underlying COPD.
High rates of resistance have developed to adamantanes (amantadine, rimantadine), and these drugs are
infrequently indicated.
A 24-year-old woman is diagnosed with genital herpes simplex virus infection. Which agent is indicated for
use in this diagnosis?
A.  Valacyclovir
B.  Cidofovir
C.  Ganciclovir
D.  Zanamivir
Correct answer = A. Valacyclovir, famciclovir, penciclovir, and acyclovir are all indicated for herpes simplex
virus infection. Cidofovir and ganciclovir are used for CMV retinitis. Zanamivir is indicated for influenza.
A woman who is being treated for chronic hepatitis B develops nephrotoxicity while on treatment. Which
medication is most likely to be included in her HBV treatment?
A.  Entecavir
B.  Ribavirin
C.  Lamivudine
D.  Adefovir
Correct answer = D. Nephrotoxicity is the most commonly seen with adefovir in the treatment of HBV. This
adverse effect is uncommon with lamivudine and entecavir. Ribavirin is used for the treatment of hepatitis C
infection (not HBV).
Which class of direct-acting antivirals for hepatitis C works by inhibiting formation of the membranous web
that provides a platform for viral replication?
A.  NS3/NS4A protease inhibitors
B.  NS5B polymerase inhibitors
C.  NS5A replication complex inhibitors
D.  Interferons
Correct answer = C. NS5A inhibitors work to inhibit the formation of proteins that form a membranous web,
which serves as a platform for viral replication. NS3/NS4A protease inhibitors prevent processing of the single
polyprotein encoded by HCV RNA into individually active proteins. NS5B polymerase inhibitors act on the RNA
polymerase responsible for HCV replication. The mechanism of interferons has not been fully defined.
Which antiretroviral drug class chelates with polyvalent cations and, as such, their administration must be
separated from antacids by several hours?
A.  Integrase inhibitors
B.  Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors
C.  Protease inhibitors
D.  Entry inhibitors1298
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1299 ---

34.7
34.8
34.9
34.10Correct answer = A. Integrase inhibitors bind to other positively charged ions, rendering them ineffective. As
such, separation of doses of these agents from aluminum-, magnesium-, and calcium-containing antacids is
recommended.
A 62-year-old man with human immunodeficiency virus infection is being treated with an antiretroviral
regimen containing elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and has achieved a
sustained undetectable level of HIV RNA. His prescriber would like to change his therapy to
elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide. Which information should the prescriber provide
to the patient that best summarizes the advantage of tenofovir alafenamide over tenofovir disoproxil
fumarate?
A.  Removal of food restrictions
B.  Fewer drug interactions
C.  Twice daily dosing
D.  Improved renal and bone safety profile
Correct answer = D. Tenofovir alafenamide delivers the same active drug as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, but
with a lower incidence of renal and bone adverse effects. Both tenofovir-containing combinations are dosed once
daily and should be taken with food. No change in drug interactions is expected, since tenofovir alafenamide is a
prodrug which, like TDF, is metabolized to tenofovir.
A 37-year-old woman with GERD and chronic hepatitis C genotype 1a infection is preparing to begin
treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir. Which is the most appropriate information for the patient regarding use
of a proton pump inhibitor during treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir?
A.  Absorption of ledipasvir is increased with increasing pH.
B.  A proton pump inhibitor can be safely administered with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir without regard to timing of the
dose or food intake.
C.  The patient should either stop using the proton pump inhibitor or take it with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir under fasted
conditions.
D.  Absorption of ledipasvir is not affected by gastric pH.
Answer = C. Absorption of ledipasvir is reduced when gastric pH is increased. Patients receiving proton pump
inhibitors should stop these agents during HCV therapy with ledipasvir or take the proton pump inhibitor with
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir under fasted conditions to ensure that gastric pH is at its lowest point of the day at the time
of drug administration.
Which HIV antiretroviral is an orally administered entry inhibitor?
A.  Maraviroc
B.  Enfuvirtide
C.  Rilpivirine
D.  Raltegravir
Answer = A. Maraviroc is the only orally administered entry inhibitor for HIV infection. Enfuvirtide is an entry
inhibitor (fusion inhibitor), but it is injected. Rilpivirine is an NNRTI, and raltegravir is an INSTI for HIV
infection.
Which drug is a pharmacokinetic enhancer used to boost levels of some HIV protease inhibitors and
elvitegravir?
A.  Cobicistat
B.  Dolutegravir
C.  Entecavir
D.  Tenofovir
Answer = A. Cobicistat is a pharmacokinetic enhancer used to boost serum levels of HIV protease inhibitors
atazanavir, darunavir, and the integrase inhibitor elvitegravir. Like elvitegravir, dolutegravir is an INSTI.
Entecavir is a guanosine nucleoside analog for the treatment of HBV infection. Tenofovir is a nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitor used in the treatment of HIV and HBV.1299

I.  Overview
It is estimated that over 25% of the population of the United States will face a diagnosis of cancer during their
lifetime, with more than 1.6 million new cancer patients diagnosed each year. Less than a quarter of these patients
will be cured solely by surgery and/or local radiation. Most of the remainder will receive systemic chemotherapy at
some time during their illness. In a small fraction (approximately 10%) of patients with cancer representing selected
neoplasms, the chemotherapy will result in a cure or a prolonged remission. However, in most cases, drug therapy
will produce only a regression of the disease, and complications and/or relapse may eventually lead to death. Thus,
the overall 5-year survival rate for cancer patients is about 68%, ranking cancer second only to cardiovascular
disease as a cause of mortality. Figure 35.1 provides a list of the anticancer agents discussed in this chapter.

II.  Principles of Cancer Chemotherapy
Cancer chemotherapy strives to cause a lethal cytotoxic event or apoptosis in the cancer cells that can arrest the
progression of tumor growth. The attack is generally directed toward DNA or against metabolic sites essential to cell
replication, for example, the availability of purines and pyrimidines, which are the building blocks for DNA or RNA
synthesis (Figure 35.2). Ideally, anticancer drugs should interfere only with cellular processes that are unique to
malignant cells. Unfortunately, most traditional anticancer drugs do not specifically recognize neoplastic cells but,
rather, affect all kinds of proliferating cells, both normal and abnormal. Therefore, almost all antitumor agents have
a steep dose–response curve for both therapeutic and toxic effects. Newer agents are being developed that take a
different approach to cancer treatment by blocking checkpoints and allowing the patient’s own immune system to
attack cancer cells. While this strategy is showing great promise, adverse effects are also a concern and present as
autoimmune toxicity, as compared to the myelosuppressive profile with traditional chemotherapy agents.

--- PAGE 1307 ---

A.  Treatment strategies
1.  Goals of treatment
The ultimate goal of chemotherapy is a cure (that is, long-term, disease-free survival). A true cure requires the
eradication of every neoplastic cell. If a cure is not attainable, then the goal becomes control of the disease (prevent
the cancer from enlarging and spreading) to extend survival and maintain quality of life. Thus, the individual
maintains a “near-normal” existence, with the cancer treated as a chronic disease. In either case, the neoplastic cell
burden is initially reduced (debulked), either by surgery and/or by radiation, followed by chemotherapy,
immunotherapy, therapy using biological modifiers, or a combination of these treatment modalities ( Figure 35.3). In
advanced stages of cancer, the likelihood of controlling the cancer is low, and the goal is palliation (alleviation of
symptoms and avoidance of life-threatening toxicity). This means that chemotherapeutic drugs may be used to
relieve symptoms caused by the cancer and improve the quality of life, even though the drugs may not extend
survival. The goal of treatment should always be kept in mind, as it often influences treatment decisions. Figure 35.4
illustrates how treatment goals can be dynamic.

patient.
Figure 35.4 Goals of treatment with chemotherapeutic agents.
1307
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1308 ---

2.  Indications for treatment
Chemotherapy is sometimes used when neoplasms are disseminated and are not amenable to surgery. Chemotherapy
may also be used as a supplemental treatment to attack micrometastases following surgery and radiation treatment,
in which case it is called adjuvant chemotherapy. Chemotherapy given prior to the surgical procedure in an attempt
to shrink the cancer is referred to as neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and chemotherapy given in lower doses to assist in
prolonging remission is known as maintenance chemotherapy.
3.  Tumor susceptibility and the growth cycle
The fraction of tumor cells that are in the replicative cycle (“growth fraction”) influences susceptibility to most
cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Rapidly dividing cells are generally more sensitive to chemotherapy, whereas
slowly proliferating cells are less sensitive to chemotherapy. In general, nondividing cells (those in the G0 phase;
Figure 35.5) usually survive the toxic effects of many chemotherapeutic agents.

--- PAGE 1310 ---

Figure 35.5 Effects of chemotherapeutic agents on the growth cycle of mammalian cells.
a.  Cell cycle specificity of drugs
Both normal cells and tumor cells go through growth cycles (Figure 35.5). However, the number of cells that are in
various stages of the cycle may differ in normal and neoplastic tissues. Chemotherapeutic agents that are effective
only against replicating cells (that is, those cells that are dividing) are said to be cell cycle specific ( Figure 35.5),
whereas other agents are cell cycle nonspecific. Although the nonspecific drugs generally have greater toxicity in
cycling cells, they are also useful against tumors that have a low percentage of replicating cells.
b.  Tumor growth rate
The growth rate of most solid tumors is initially rapid, but growth rate usually decreases as the tumor size increases
(see Figure 35.3). This is due to a deficiency of nutrients and oxygen caused by inadequate vascularization and lack
of blood circulation. Tumor burden can be reduced through surgery, radiation, or use of cell cycle–nonspecific drugs
that promote the remaining cells into active proliferation, thus increasing susceptibility to cell cycle–specific
chemotherapeutic agents.
1310
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1311 ---

B.  Treatment regimens and scheduling
Drug dosages are usually calculated on the basis of body surface area, in an effort to tailor the dosage to each
patient.
1.  Log kill phenomenon
Destruction of cancer cells by chemotherapeutic agents follows first-order kinetics (that is, a given dose of drug
destroys a constant fraction of cells). The term “log kill” is used to describe this phenomenon. For example, a
diagnosis of leukemia is generally made when there are about 109 (total) leukemic cells. Consequently, if treatment
leads to a 99.999% kill, then 0.001% of 109 cells (or 104 cells) remain. This is defined as a 5-log kill (reduction of
105 cells). At this point, the patient becomes asymptomatic, and the patient is in remission (see Figure 35.3). For
most bacterial infections, a 5-log (100,000-fold) reduction in the number of microorganisms results in a cure,
because the immune system can destroy the remaining bacterial cells. However, tumor cells are not as readily
eliminated, and additional treatment is required to totally eradicate the leukemic cell population.
2.  Pharmacologic sanctuaries
Leukemic or other tumor cells find sanctuary in tissues such as the central nervous system (CNS), where transport
constraints prevent certain chemotherapeutic agents from entrance. Therefore, a patient may require irradiation of
the craniospinal axis or intrathecal administration of drugs to eliminate leukemic cells at that site. Similarly, drugs
may be unable to penetrate certain areas of solid tumors.
3.  Treatment protocols
Combination chemotherapy is more successful than single-drug treatment in most cancers for which chemotherapy
is effective.
a.  Combination chemotherapy
Cytotoxic agents with different toxicities, and with different molecular sites and mechanisms of action, are usually
combined at full doses. This results in higher response rates, due to additive and/or potentiated cytotoxic effects, and
nonoverlapping host toxicities. In contrast, agents with similar dose-limiting toxicities, such as myelosuppression,
nephrotoxicity, or cardiotoxicity, can be combined safely only by reducing the doses of each.
b.  Advantages of combinations
The advantages of combination chemotherapy are that it 1) provides maximal cell killing within the range of
tolerated toxicity, 2) is effective against a broader range of cell lines in the heterogeneous tumor population, and 3)
may delay or prevent the development of resistant cell lines.
c.  Treatment protocols
Many cancer treatment protocols have been developed, and each is applicable to a particular neoplastic state. They
are usually identified by an acronym. For example, a common regimen called R-CHOP, used for the treatment of
non-Hodgkin lymphoma, consists of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin (doxorubicin), Oncovin
(vincristine), and prednisone. Therapy is scheduled intermittently to allow recovery or rescue of the immune system,
which is also affected by the chemotherapeutic agents, thus reducing the risk of serious infection.
1311
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1312 ---

C.  Resistance and toxicity with chemotherapy
Cancer drugs are toxins that present a lethal threat to the cells. It is, therefore, not surprising that cells have evolved
elaborate defense mechanisms to protect themselves from chemical toxins, including chemotherapeutic agents.
1.  Resistance
Some neoplastic cells (for example, melanoma) are inherently resistant to most anticancer drugs. Other tumor types
may acquire resistance to the cytotoxic effects of a drug by mutating, particularly after prolonged administration of
suboptimal doses. The development of drug resistance is minimized by short-term, intensive, intermittent therapy
with combinations of drugs. Drug combinations are also effective against a broader range of resistant cells in the
tumor population.
2.  Multidrug resistance
Stepwise selection of an amplified gene that codes for a transmembrane protein (P-glycoprotein for “permeability”
glycoprotein; Figure 35.6) is responsible for multidrug resistance. This resistance is due to adenosine triphosphate–
dependent pumping of drugs out of the cell in the presence of P-glycoprotein. Cross-resistance following the use of
structurally unrelated agents also occurs. For example, cells that are resistant to the cytotoxic effects of the Vinca
alkaloids are also resistant to dactinomycin and to the anthracycline antibiotics, as well as to colchicine, and vice
versa. These drugs are all naturally occurring substances, each of which has a hydrophobic aromatic ring and a
positive charge at neutral pH. [Note: P-glycoprotein is normally expressed at low levels in most cell types, but
higher levels are found in the kidney, liver, pancreas, small intestine, colon, and adrenal gland. It has been suggested
that the presence of P-glycoprotein may account for the intrinsic resistance to chemotherapy observed with
adenocarcinomas.] Certain drugs at high concentrations (for example, verapamil ) can inhibit the pump and, thus,
interfere with the efflux of the anticancer agent. However, these drugs are undesirable because of adverse
pharmacologic actions of their own. Pharmacologically inert pump blockers are being sought.

channel for the ATP-dependent pumping of drugs from the cell.
3.  Toxicity
Therapy aimed at killing rapidly dividing cancer cells also affects normal cells undergoing rapid proliferation (for
example, cells of the buccal mucosa, bone marrow, gastrointestinal [GI] mucosa, and hair follicles), contributing to
the toxic manifestations of chemotherapy.
a.  Common adverse effects
Most chemotherapeutic agents have a narrow therapeutic index. Severe vomiting, stomatitis, bone marrow
suppression, and alopecia occur to varying extents during therapy with most antineoplastic agents. Vomiting is often
controlled by administration of antiemetic drugs. Some toxicities, such as myelosuppression that predisposes to
infection, are common to many chemotherapeutic agents (Figure 35.7), whereas other adverse reactions are confined
to specific agents, such as bladder toxicity with cyclophosphamide, cardiotoxicity with doxorubicin, and pulmonary
fibrosis with bleomycin. The duration of the adverse effects varies widely. For example, alopecia is transient, but the
cardiac, pulmonary, and bladder toxicities can be irreversible.
Figure 35.7 Comparison of myelosuppressive potential of chemotherapeutic drugs.
b.  Minimizing adverse effects
Some toxic reactions may be ameliorated by interventions, such as the use of cytoprotectant drugs, local perfusion of
the tumor (for example, a sarcoma of the arm), removal of some marrow of the patient prior to intensive treatment
and then reimplantation afterward, or intensive hydration and diuresis to prevent bladder toxicities. The
megaloblastic anemia that occurs with methotrexate can be effectively counteracted by administering folinic acid
(leucovorin). With the availability of human granulocyte colony-stimulating factors, the neutropenia associated with1313

treatment of cancer by many drugs can be partially reversed.
4.  Treatment-induced tumors
Because most antineoplastic agents are mutagens, neoplasms (for example, acute nonlymphocytic leukemia) may
arise 10 or more years after the original cancer was cured. [Note: Treatment-induced neoplasms are especially a
problem after therapy with alkylating agents.] Most tumors that develop from cancer chemotherapeutic agents
respond well to treatment strategies.

III.  Antimetabolites
Antimetabolites are structurally related to normal compounds that exist within the cell ( Figure 35.8). They generally
interfere with the availability of normal purine or pyrimidine nucleotide precursors, either by inhibiting their
synthesis or by competing with them in DNA or RNA synthesis. Their maximal cytotoxic effects are in S phase and
are, therefore, cell cycle specific.

nervous system; D = diarrhea; IM = intramuscular; IT = intrathecal; IV = intravenous; N

A.  Methotrexate, pemetrexed, and pralatrexate
The vitamin folic acid plays a central role in a variety of metabolic reactions involving the transfer of one-carbon
units and is essential for cell replication. Folic acid is obtained mainly from dietary sources and from that produced
by intestinal flora. Methotrexate [meth-oh-TREK-sate] (MTX ), pemetrexed [pem-e-TREX-ed], and pralatrexate
[pral-a-TREX-ate] are antifolate agents.
1.  Mechanism of action
MTX  is structurally related to folic acid and acts as an antagonist of the vitamin by inhibiting mammalian
dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), the enzyme that converts folic acid to its active, coenzyme form, tetrahydrofolic
acid (FH4) (Figure 35.9). The inhibition of DHFR can only be reversed by a 1000-fold excess of the natural
substrate, dihydrofolate (FH2), or by administration of leucovorin, which bypasses the blocked enzyme and
replenishes the folate pool (Figure 35.9). [Note: Leucovorin, or folinic acid, is the N5-formyl group–carrying form of
FH4.] MTX  is specific for the S phase of the cell cycle. Pemetrexed is an antimetabolite similar in mechanism to
methotrexate. However, in addition to inhibiting DHFR, it also inhibits thymidylate synthase and other enzymes
involved in folate metabolism and DNA synthesis. Pralatrexate is an antimetabolite that also inhibits DHFR.

2.  Therapeutic uses
MTX , usually in combination with other drugs, is effective against acute lymphocytic leukemia, Burkitt lymphoma
in children, breast cancer, bladder cancer, and head and neck carcinomas. In addition, low-dose MTX  is effective as
a single agent against certain inflammatory diseases, such as severe psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as
Crohn disease. All patients receiving MTX  require close monitoring for possible toxic effects. Pemetrexed is
primarily used in non–small cell lung cancer. Pralatrexate is used in relapsed or refractory T-cell lymphoma.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
MTX  is variably absorbed at low doses from the GI tract, but it can also be administered by intramuscular,
intravenous (IV), and intrathecal routes (Figure 35.10). Because MTX  does not easily penetrate the blood–brain
barrier, it can be administered intrathecally to destroy neoplastic cells that thrive in the sanctuary of the CNS. High
concentrations of the drug are found in the intestinal epithelium, liver, and kidney, as well as in ascites and pleural
effusions. MTX is also distributed to the skin. Small amounts of MTX  undergo hydroxylation at the 7th position to
form 7-hydroxymethotrexate. This derivative is less water soluble than MTX  and may lead to crystalluria. Therefore,
it is important to keep the urine alkaline and the patient well hydrated to avoid renal toxicity. Excretion of the parent
drug and the 7-OH metabolite occurs primarily via urine.
Figure 35.10 Administration and fate of methotrexate. CNS = central nervous system; IV
= intravenous; IM = intramuscular.
4.  Adverse effects
Adverse effects of MTX  are outlined in Figure 35.8. Pemetrexed and pralatrexate should be given with folic acid
and vitamin B12 supplements to reduce hematologic and GI toxicities. Pretreatment with corticosteroids to prevent
cutaneous reactions is recommended with pemetrexed.

B.  6-Mercaptopurine
6-Mercaptopurine [mer-kap-toe-PYOOR-een] (6-MP ), a purine antimetabolite, is the thiol analog of hypoxanthine.
6-MP  and 6-thioguanine were the first purine analogs to prove beneficial for treating neoplastic disease. [Note:
Azathioprine, an immunosuppressant, exerts its cytotoxic effects after conversion to 6-MP .] 6-MP  is used principally
in the maintenance of remission in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. 6-MP  and its analog, azathioprine, are also
beneficial in the treatment of Crohn disease. Adverse effects are noted in Figure 35.8.

C.  Fludarabine
Fludarabine [floo-DARE-a-been] is the 5′-phosphate of 2-fluoroadenine arabinoside, a purine nucleotide analog. It
is useful in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia, and indolent non-Hodgkin
lymphoma. Fludarabine is a prodrug, and the phosphate is removed in the plasma to form 2-F-araA, which is taken
up into cells and again phosphorylated (initially by deoxycytidine kinase). Although the exact cytotoxic mechanism
is uncertain, the triphosphate is incorporated into both DNA and RNA. This decreases their synthesis in the S phase
and affects their function. Resistance is associated with reduced uptake into cells, lack of deoxycytidine kinase, and
decreased affinity for DNA polymerase, as well as other mechanisms. Fludarabine is administered IV rather than
orally, because intestinal bacteria split off the sugar to yield the very toxic metabolite, fluoroadenine.

D.  5-Fluorouracil
5-Fluorouracil  [flure-oh-YOOR-ah-sil] (5-FU), a pyrimidine analog, has a stable fluorine atom in place of a
hydrogen atom at position 5 of the uracil ring. The fluorine interferes with the conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to
thymidylic acid, thus depriving the cell of thymidine, one of the essential precursors for DNA synthesis. 5-FU is
employed primarily in the treatment of slow-growing solid tumors (for example, colorectal, breast, ovarian,
pancreatic, and gastric carcinomas). When applied topically, 5-FU is also effective for the treatment of superficial
basal cell carcinomas.
1.  Mechanism of action
5-FU itself is devoid of antineoplastic activity. It enters the cell through a carrier-mediated transport system and is
converted to the corresponding deoxynucleotide (5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate [5-FdUMP]; Figure 35.11),
which competes with deoxyuridine monophosphate for thymidylate synthase, thus inhibiting its action. DNA
synthesis decreases due to lack of thymidine, leading to imbalanced cell growth and “thymidine-less death” of
rapidly dividing cells. [Note: Leucovorin is administered with 5-FU, because the reduced folate coenzyme is
required in the thymidylate synthase inhibition. For example, a standard regimen for advanced colorectal cancer is
irinotecan plus 5-FU/leucovorin.] 5-FU is also incorporated into RNA, and low levels have been detected in DNA.
In the latter case, a glycosylase excises the 5-FU, damaging the DNA. 5-FU produces the anticancer effect in the S
phase of the cell cycle.

2.  Pharmacokinetics
Because of severe toxicity to the GI tract, 5-FU is administered IV or, in the case of skin cancer, topically. The drug
penetrates well into all tissues, including the CNS. 5-FU is rapidly metabolized in the liver, lung, and kidney. It is
eventually converted to fluoro-β-alanine, which is removed in the urine. Elevated levels of dihydropyrimidine
dehydrogenase (DPD) can increase the rate of 5-FU catabolism and decrease its bioavailability. The level of DPD
varies from individual to individual and may differ by as much as six-fold in the general population. Patients with
DPD deficiency may experience severe toxicity manifested by pancytopenia, mucositis, and life-threatening
diarrhea. Knowledge of DPD activity in an individual should allow more appropriate dosing of 5-FU.

E.  Capecitabine
Capecitabine [KAP-e-SYE-ta-been] is a fluoropyrimidine carbamate. It is used in the treatment of colorectal and
metastatic breast cancer. Capecitabine is well absorbed following oral administration. After being absorbed,
capecitabine, which is itself nontoxic, undergoes a series of enzymatic reactions, the last of which is hydrolysis to 5-
FU. This step is catalyzed by thymidine phosphorylase, an enzyme that is concentrated primarily in tumors (Figure
35.12). Thus, the cytotoxic activity of capecitabine is the same as that of 5-FU and is tumor specific. The most
important enzyme inhibited by 5-FU (and, thus, capecitabine) is thymidylate synthase.

F.  Cytarabine
Cytarabine [sye-TARE-ah-been] (cytosine arabinoside or ara-C ) is an analog of 2′-deoxycytidine in which the
natural ribose residue is replaced by D-arabinose. Cytarabine acts as a pyrimidine antagonist. The major clinical use
of cytarabine is in acute nonlymphocytic (myelogenous) leukemia (AML). Cytarabine enters the cell by a carrier-
mediated process and, like the other purine and pyrimidine antagonists, must be sequentially phosphorylated by
deoxycytidine kinase and other nucleotide kinases to the nucleotide form (cytosine arabinoside triphosphate or ara-
CTP) to be cytotoxic. Ara-CTP is an effective inhibitor of DNA polymerase. The nucleotide is also incorporated into
nuclear DNA and can terminate chain elongation. It is, therefore, S phase (and, hence, cell cycle) specific.
1.  Pharmacokinetics
Cytarabine is not effective when given orally, because of deamination to the noncytotoxic ara-U by cytidine
deaminase in the intestinal mucosa and liver. Given IV, it distributes throughout the body but does not penetrate the
CNS in sufficient amounts. Therefore, it may also be injected intrathecally. Cytarabine undergoes extensive
oxidative deamination in the body to ara-U, a pharmacologically inactive metabolite. Both cytarabine and ara-U are
excreted in urine.

G.  Azacitidine
Azacitidine [A-zuh-SITE-i-dine] is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. It is used for the treatment of
myelodysplastic syndromes and AML. Azacitidine undergoes activation to the nucleotide metabolite azacitidine
triphosphate and gets incorporated into RNA to inhibit RNA processing and function. It is S-phase cell cycle
specific.

H.  Gemcitabine
Gemcitabine [jem-SITE-ah-been] is an analog of the nucleoside deoxycytidine. It is used most commonly for
pancreatic cancer and non–small cell lung cancer. Gemcitabine is a substrate for deoxycytidine kinase, which
phosphorylates the drug to 2′,2′-difluorodeoxycytidine triphosphate (Figure 35.13). Gemcitabine is administered by
IV infusion. It is deaminated to difluorodeoxyuridine, which is not cytotoxic, and is excreted in urine.

Antibiotics
The antitumor antibiotics (Figure 35.14) owe their cytotoxic action primarily to their interactions with DNA, leading
to disruption of DNA function. In addition to intercalation, their abilities to inhibit topoisomerases (I and II) and
produce free radicals also play a major role in their cytotoxic effect. They are cell cycle nonspecific, with bleomycin
as an exception.

A.  Anthracyclines: Doxorubicin, daunorubicin, idarubicin,
epirubicin, and mitoxantrone
Doxorubicin [dox-oh-ROO-bi-sin] and daunorubicin [daw-noe-ROO-bi-sin] are classified as anthracycline
antibiotics. Doxorubicin is the hydroxylated analog of daunorubicin. Idarubicin [eye-da-ROO-bi-sin], the 4-
demethoxy analog of daunorubicin, epirubicin [eh-pee-ROO-bih-sin], and mitoxantrone [mye-toe-ZAN-trone] are
also available. Therapeutic uses for these agents differ despite their structural similarity and apparently similar
mechanisms of action. Doxorubicin is one of the most important and widely used anticancer drugs. It is used in
combination with other agents for treatment of sarcomas and a variety of carcinomas, including breast cancer, as
well as for treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia and lymphomas. Daunorubicin and idarubicin are used in the
treatment of acute leukemias, and mitoxantrone is used in prostate cancer.
1.  Mechanism of action
Doxorubicin and other anthracyclines induce cytotoxicity through several different mechanisms. For example,
doxorubicin-derived free radicals can induce membrane lipid peroxidation, DNA strand scission, and direct
oxidation of purine or pyrimidine bases, thiols, and amines (Figure 35.15).
Figure 35.15 Doxorubicin interacts with molecular oxygen, producing superoxide ions
and hydrogen peroxide, which cause single-strand breaks in DNA.
2.  Pharmacokinetics
These agents must be administered intravenously, because they are inactivated in the GI tract. Extravasation is a
serious problem that can lead to tissue necrosis. The anthracycline antibiotics bind to plasma proteins as well as to
other tissue components, where they are widely distributed. They do not penetrate the blood–brain barrier or the
testes. These agents undergo extensive hepatic metabolism, and dosage adjustments are needed in patients with
impaired hepatic function. Biliary excretion is the major route of elimination. Because of the dark red color of the
anthracycline drugs, the veins may become visible surrounding the site of infusion, and red discoloration of urine
may occur.
3.  Adverse effects
Irreversible, dose-dependent cardiotoxicity is the most serious adverse reaction and is more common with
daunorubicin and doxorubicin than with idarubicin and epirubicin. Cardiotoxicity apparently results from the
generation of free radicals and lipid peroxidation. Addition of trastuzumab to protocols with doxorubicin or
epirubicin increases the risk of congestive heart failure. There has been some success with the iron chelator
dexrazoxane in protecting against the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin. The liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin is
reported to be less cardiotoxic than the standard formulation.1329

B.  Bleomycin
Bleomycin [blee-oh-MYE-sin] is a mixture of different copper-chelating glycopeptides that, like the anthracycline
antibiotics, cause scission of DNA by an oxidative process. Bleomycin is cell cycle specific and causes cells to
accumulate in the G2 phase. It is primarily used in the treatment of testicular cancers and Hodgkin lymphoma.
1.  Mechanism of action
A DNA–bleomycin–Fe2+ complex appears to undergo oxidation to bleomycin–Fe3+. The liberated electrons react
with oxygen to form superoxide or hydroxyl radicals, which, in turn, attack the phosphodiester bonds of DNA,
resulting in strand breakage and chromosomal aberrations (Figure 35.16).
Figure 35.16 Bleomycin causes breaks in DNA by an oxidative process.
2.  Pharmacokinetics
Bleomycin is administered by a number of routes. The bleomycin-inactivating enzyme (a hydrolase) is high in a
number of tissues (for example, liver and spleen) but is low in the lung and absent in the skin, accounting for
toxicity in those tissues. Most of the parent drug is excreted unchanged in the urine, necessitating dose adjustment in
patients with renal failure.
3.  Adverse effects
Pulmonary toxicity is the most serious adverse effect, progressing from rales, cough, and infiltrate to potentially
fatal fibrosis. The pulmonary fibrosis that is caused by bleomycin is often referred as “bleomycin lung.”
Hypertrophic skin changes and hyperpigmentation of the hands are prevalent. Bleomycin is unusual in that
myelosuppression is rare.

V.  Alkylating Agents
Alkylating agents (Figure 35.17) exert their cytotoxic effects by covalently binding to nucleophilic groups on
various cell constituents. Alkylation of DNA is probably the crucial cytotoxic reaction that is lethal to the tumor
cells. Alkylating agents do not discriminate between cycling and resting cells, even though they are most toxic for
rapidly dividing cells. They are used in combination with other agents to treat a wide variety of lymphatic and solid
cancers. In addition to being cytotoxic, all are mutagenic and carcinogenic and can lead to secondary malignancies
such as acute leukemia.

A.  Cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide
These drugs are very closely related mustard agents that share most of the same primary mechanisms and toxicities.
They are cytotoxic only after generation of their alkylating species, which are produced through hydroxylation by
cytochrome P450 (CYP450). These agents have a broad clinical spectrum and are used as single agents or in
combinations in the treatment of a wide variety of neoplastic diseases, such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, sarcoma,
and breast cancer.
1.  Mechanism of action
Cyclophosphamide [sye-kloe-FOSS-fah-mide] is the most commonly used alkylating agent. Both cyclophosphamide
and ifosfamide [eye-FOSS-fah-mide] are first biotransformed to hydroxylated intermediates primarily in the liver by
the CYP450 system (Figure 35.18). The hydroxylated intermediates then undergo metabolism to form the active
compounds, phosphoramide mustard and acrolein. Reaction of the phosphoramide mustard with DNA is considered
to be the cytotoxic step.
Figure 35.18 Activation of cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide by hepatic cytochrome
P450.
2.  Pharmacokinetics
Cyclophosphamide is available in oral and IV preparations, whereas ifosfamide is IV only. Cyclophosphamide is
metabolized in the liver to active and inactive metabolites, and minimal amounts are excreted in the urine as
unchanged drug. Ifosfamide is metabolized primarily by CYP450 3A4 and 2B6 isoenzymes. It is mainly renally
excreted.
3.  Adverse effects
A unique toxicity of both drugs is hemorrhagic cystitis, which can lead to fibrosis of the bladder. Bladder toxicity
has been attributed to acrolein in the urine in the case of cyclophosphamide and to toxic metabolites of ifosfamide.
Adequate hydration as well as IV injection of mesna (sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate), which neutralizes the
toxic metabolites, can minimize this problem. Neurotoxicity has been reported in patients on high-dose ifosfamide,
probably due to the metabolite, chloroacetaldehyde.

B.  Nitrosoureas
Carmustine [KAR-mus-teen, BCNU] and lomustine [LOE-mus-teen, CCNU] are closely related nitrosoureas.
Because of their ability to penetrate the CNS, the nitrosoureas are primarily employed in the treatment of brain
tumors.
1.  Mechanism of action
The nitrosoureas exert cytotoxic effects by an alkylation that inhibits replication and, eventually, RNA and protein
synthesis. Although they alkylate DNA in resting cells, cytotoxicity is expressed primarily in cells that are actively
dividing. Therefore, nondividing cells can escape death if DNA repair occurs. Nitrosoureas also inhibit several key
enzymatic processes by carbamoylation of amino acids in proteins in the targeted cells.
2.  Pharmacokinetics
Carmustine is administered IV and as chemotherapy wafer implants, whereas lomustine is given orally. Because of
their lipophilicity, these agents distribute widely in the body and readily penetrate the CNS. The drugs undergo
extensive metabolism. Lomustine is metabolized to active products. The kidney is the major excretory route for the
nitrosoureas (Figure 35.19).

C.  Dacarbazine and temozolomide
Dacarbazine [dah-KAR-bah-zeen] is an alkylating agent that must undergo biotransformation to an active
metabolite, methyltriazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). The metabolite is responsible for the alkylating activity
of this agent by forming methyl carbonium ions that attack the nucleophilic groups in the DNA molecule. The
cytotoxic action of dacarbazine has been attributed to the ability of its metabolite to methylate DNA on the O-6
position of guanine. Dacarbazine has found use in the treatment of melanoma and Hodgkin lymphoma.
Temozolomide [te-moe-ZOE-loe-mide] is related to dacarbazine, because both must undergo biotransformation
to an active metabolite, MTIC, which is likely responsible for the methylation of DNA on the O-6 and N-7 position
of guanine. Unlike dacarbazine, temozolomide does not require the CYP450 system for metabolic transformation,
and it undergoes chemical transformation at normal physiological pH. Temozolomide also inhibits the repair
enzyme, O-6-guanine-DNA alkyltransferase. Temozolomide differs from dacarbazine in that it crosses the blood–
brain barrier and, therefore, is used in the treatment of brain tumors such as glioblastomas and astrocytomas. It is
also used in metastatic melanoma. Temozolomide is administered intravenously or orally and has excellent
bioavailability after oral administration. The parent drug and metabolites are excreted in urine (Figure 35.20).

D.  Other alkylating agents
Mechlorethamine [mek-lor-ETH-ah-meen] was developed as a vesicant (nitrogen mustard) during World War I. Its
ability to cause lymphocytopenia led to its use in lymphatic cancers. Melphalan [MEL-fah-lan], a phenylalanine
derivative of nitrogen mustard, is used in the treatment of multiple myeloma. This is a bifunctional alkylating agent
that can be given orally, although the plasma concentration differs from patient to patient due to variation in
intestinal absorption and metabolism. The dose of melphalan is carefully adjusted by monitoring the platelet and
white blood cell counts. Chlorambucil  [clor-AM-byoo-sil] is another bifunctional alkylating agent that is used in the
treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Busulfan [byoo-SUL-fan] is an alkylating agent that is effective against
chronic myelogenous leukemia. This agent can cause pulmonary fibrosis (“busulfan lung”). Like other alkylating
agents, all of these agents are leukemogenic.

VI.  Microtubule Inhibitors
The mitotic spindle is part of a larger, intracellular skeleton (cytoskeleton) that is essential for the movements of
structures occurring in the cytoplasm of all eukaryotic cells. The mitotic spindle consists of chromatin plus a system
of microtubules composed of the protein tubulin. The mitotic spindle is essential for the equal partitioning of DNA
into the two daughter cells that are formed when a eukaryotic cell divides. Several plant-derived substances used as
anticancer drugs disrupt this process by affecting the equilibrium between the polymerized and depolymerized forms
of the microtubules, thereby causing cytotoxicity. The microtubule inhibitors are summarized in Figure 35.21.

A.  Vincristine and vinblastine
Vincristine [vin-KRIS-teen] (VX ) and vinblastine [vin-BLAS-teen] (VBL ) are structurally related compounds derived
from the periwinkle plant, Vinca rosea . They are, therefore, referred to as the Vinca alkaloids. A less neurotoxic
agent is vinorelbine [vye-NOR-el-been] (VRB ). Although the Vinca alkaloids are structurally similar, their
therapeutic indications are different. They are generally administered in combination with other drugs. VX is used in
the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children, Wilms tumor, Ewing soft tissue sarcoma, and Hodgkin
and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, as well as some other rapidly proliferating neoplasms. [Note: VX (former trade name,
Oncovin) is the “O” in the R-CHOP regimen for lymphoma. Due to relatively mild myelosuppressive activity, VX is
used in a number of other protocols.] VBL is administered with bleomycin and cisplatin for the treatment of
metastatic testicular carcinoma. It is also used in the treatment of systemic Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas.
VRB is beneficial in the treatment of advanced non–small cell lung cancer, either as a single agent or with cisplatin.
1.  Mechanism of action
These agents are cell cycle specific and phase specific, because they block mitosis in metaphase (M phase). Their
binding to the microtubular protein, tubulin, blocks the ability of tubulin to polymerize to form microtubules.
Instead, paracrystalline aggregates consisting of tubulin dimers and the alkaloid drug are formed. The resulting
dysfunctional spindle apparatus, frozen in metaphase, prevents chromosomal segregation and cell proliferation
(Figure 35.22).

Figure 35.22 Mechanism of action of the microtubule inhibitors.
2.  Pharmacokinetics
IV injection of these agents leads to rapid cytotoxic effects and cell destruction. This, in turn, can cause
hyperuricemia due to the oxidation of purines that are released from fragmenting DNA molecules. The Vinca
alkaloids are concentrated and metabolized in the liver by the CYP450 pathway and eliminated in bile and feces.
Dosage adjustment is required in patients with impaired hepatic function or biliary obstruction.
3.  Adverse effects
VX and VBL  are both associated with phlebitis or cellulitis if extravasation occurs during injection, as well as nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, and alopecia. VBL is a potent myelosuppressant, whereas peripheral neuropathy (paresthesias,
loss of reflexes, foot drop, and ataxia) and constipation are more common with VX. These agents should not be
administered intrathecally. This potential drug error can result in death, and special precautions should be in place
for administration.

B.  Paclitaxel and docetaxel
Paclitaxel  [PAK-li-tax-el] was the first member of the taxane family to be used in cancer chemotherapy.
Semisynthetic paclitaxel  is available through chemical modification of a precursor found in the needles of Pacific
yew species. An albumin-bound form is also available. Substitution of a side chain resulted in docetaxel  [doe-see-
TAX-el], which is the more potent of the two drugs. Paclitaxel  has good activity against advanced ovarian cancer
and metastatic breast cancer, as well as non–small cell lung cancer when administered with cisplatin. Docetaxel  is
commonly used in prostate, breast, GI, and non–small cell lung cancers.
1.  Mechanism of action
Both drugs are active in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, but unlike the Vinca alkaloids, they promote
polymerization and stabilization of the polymer rather than disassembly, leading to the accumulation of
microtubules (Figure 35.23). The microtubules formed are overly stable and nonfunctional, and chromosome
desegregation does not occur. This results in cell death.

--- PAGE 1344 ---

These agents undergo hepatic metabolism by the CYP450 system and are excreted via the biliary system. Dosages
should be reduced in patients with hepatic dysfunction.
3.  Adverse effects
The dose-limiting toxicities of paclitaxel  and docetaxel  are neutropenia and leukopenia. Peripheral neuropathy is
also a common adverse effect with the taxanes. [Note: Because of serious hypersensitivity reactions (including
dyspnea, urticaria, and hypotension), patients who are treated with paclitaxel  should be premedicated with
dexamethasone and diphenhydramine, as well as with an H2 receptor antagonist.]

VII.  Steroid Hormones and Their Antagonists
Tumors that are sensitive to steroid hormones may be either 1) hormone responsive, in which the tumor regresses
following treatment with a specific hormone; or 2) hormone dependent, in which removal of a hormonal stimulus
causes tumor regression; or 3) both. Removal of hormonal stimuli from hormone-dependent tumors can be
accomplished by surgery (for example, in the case of orchiectomy—surgical removal of one or both testes—for
patients with advanced prostate cancer) or by drugs (for example, in breast cancer treatment with the antiestrogen
tamoxifen prevents estrogen stimulation of breast cancer cells; Figure 35.24). For a steroid hormone to influence a
cell, that cell must have intracellular (cytosolic) receptors that are specific for that hormone (Figure 35.25A).

A.  Tamoxifen
Tamoxifen [tah-MOX-ih-fen] is a selective estrogen modulator (SERM). It is an estrogen antagonist in breast tissue
and an agonist in other tissues, such as bone and the endometrium. Tamoxifen is used for first-line therapy in the
treatment of estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer. It is also used for prevention of breast cancer in high-risk
women.
1.  Mechanism of action
Tamoxifen competes with estrogen for binding to estrogen receptors in the breast tissue, and inhibits estrogen-
induced growth of breast cancer (Figure 35.25B ). The result is a depletion (down-regulation) of estrogen receptors,
and the growth-promoting effects of the natural hormone and other growth factors are suppressed.
2.  Pharmacokinetics
Tamoxifen is effective after oral administration. It is partially metabolized by the liver. Some metabolites possess
estrogen antagonist activity, whereas others have agonist activity. Unchanged drug and metabolites are excreted
predominantly through the bile into the feces. Tamoxifen is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein.
3.  Adverse effects
Adverse effects caused by tamoxifen include hot flashes, nausea, vomiting, skin rash, and vaginal bleeding and
discharge (due to estrogenic activity of the drug and some of its metabolites in the endometrial tissue). Tamoxifen
has the potential to cause endometrial cancer. Other toxicities include thromboembolism and effects on vision.
1348

--- PAGE 1349 ---

B.  Fulvestrant and raloxifene
Fulvestrant  [fool-VES-trant] is an estrogen receptor antagonist that is given via intramuscular injection to patients
with hormone receptor–positive metastatic breast cancer. This agent binds to and causes estrogen receptor down-
regulation on tumors and other targets. Raloxifene [ral-OKS-i-feen] is an oral SERM that blocks estrogen effects in
the uterine and breast tissues, while promoting effects in the bone to inhibit resorption. This agent reduces the risk of
estrogen receptor–positive invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Both drugs are known to cause hot
flashes, arthralgias, and myalgias.
1349
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1350 ---

C.  Aromatase inhibitors
The aromatase reaction is responsible for extra-adrenal synthesis of estrogen from androstenedione, which takes
place in liver, fat, muscle, skin, and breast tissues, including breast malignancies. Peripheral aromatization is an
important source of estrogen in postmenopausal women. Aromatase inhibitors decrease the production of estrogen in
these women.
1.  Anastrozole and letrozole
Anastrozole [an-AS-troe-zole] and letrozole [LE-troe-zole] are nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors. These agents are
considered first-line drugs for the treatment of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. They are orally active and
cause almost a total suppression of estrogen synthesis. Anastrozole and letrozole do not predispose patients to
endometrial cancer. Both drugs are extensively metabolized in the liver, and metabolites and parent drug are
excreted primarily in the urine.
2.  Exemestane
A steroidal, irreversible inhibitor of aromatase, exemestane [ex-uh-MES-tane], is well absorbed after oral
administration and widely distributed. Hepatic metabolism occurs via the CYP3A4 isoenzyme. Because the
metabolites are excreted in urine, doses of the drug must be adjusted in patients with renal failure. Major toxicities
are nausea, fatigue, and hot flashes. Alopecia and dermatitis have also been noted.
1350

--- PAGE 1351 ---

D.  Leuprolide, goserelin, and triptorelin
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is normally secreted by the hypothalamus and stimulates the anterior
pituitary to secrete the gonadotropic hormones: 1) luteinizing hormone (LH), the primary stimulus for the secretion
of testosterone by the testes, and 2) follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which stimulates the secretion of estrogen.
Leuprolide [loo-PROE-lide], goserelin [GOE-se-rel-in], and triptorelin [TRIP-to-rel-in] are synthetic analogs of
GnRH. As GnRH analogs, they occupy the GnRH receptor in the pituitary, which leads to its desensitization and,
consequently, inhibition of release of FSH and LH. Thus, both androgen and estrogen synthesis are reduced (Figure
35.26). Response to leuprolide in prostatic cancer is equivalent to that of orchiectomy with regression of tumor and
relief of bone pain. These drugs have some benefit in premenopausal women with advanced breast cancer and have
largely replaced estrogens in therapy for prostate cancer. Leuprolide is available as 1) a subcutaneous daily injection,
2) a subcutaneous depot injection, or 3) an intramuscular depot injection to treat metastatic carcinoma of the
prostate. Goserelin acetate is a subcutaneous implant, and triptorelin pamoate is injected intramuscularly. Levels of
androgen in prostate cancer patients may initially rise, but then fall to castration levels. The adverse effects of these
drugs, including impotence, hot flashes, and tumor flare, are minimal compared to those experienced with estrogen
treatment.

E.  Antiandrogens
Flutamide [FLOO-ta-mide], nilutamide [nye-LOO-ta-mide], bicalutamide [bye-ka-LOO-ta-mide], and enzalutamide
[enz-a-LOO-ta-mide] are oral antiandrogens used in the treatment of prostate cancer. They compete with the natural
hormone for binding to the androgen receptor and prevent its action in the prostate (see Figure 35.26). Adverse
effects include gynecomastia, constipation, nausea, and abdominal pain. Rarely, liver failure has occurred with
flutamide. Nilutamide can cause visual problems.

VIII.  Platinum Coordination Complexes
1355
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1356 ---

A.  Cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin
Cisplatin [SIS-pla-tin] was the first member of the platinum coordination complex class of anticancer drugs, but
because of severe toxicity, carboplatin [KAR-boe-pla-tin] was developed. The potency, pharmacokinetics, patterns
of distribution, and dose-limiting toxicities differ significantly ( Figure 35.27) between the two drugs. Cisplatin has
synergistic cytotoxicity with radiation and other chemotherapeutic agents. It has found wide application in the
treatment of solid tumors, such as metastatic testicular carcinoma in combination with VBL and bleomycin, ovarian
carcinoma in combination with cyclophosphamide, or alone for bladder carcinoma. Carboplatin is used when
patients cannot be vigorously hydrated, as is required for cisplatin treatment, or if they suffer from kidney
dysfunction or are prone to neuro- or ototoxicity. Oxaliplatin [ox-AL-ih-pla-tin] is a closely related analog of
carboplatin used in the setting of colorectal cancer.
Figure 35.27 Summary of platinum coordination complexes. AUC = area under the
curve; CBC = complete blood count; CMP = complete metabolic panel; IA = intra-
arterially; IP = intraperitoneally; IV = intravenous; N = nausea; V = vomiting.
1.  Mechanism of action
The mechanism of action for these agents is similar to that of the alkylating agents. In the high-chloride milieu of the
plasma, cisplatin persists as the neutral species, which enters the cell and loses chloride in the low-chloride milieu. It
then binds to guanine in DNA, forming inter- and intrastrand cross-links. The resulting cytotoxic lesion inhibits both
polymerases for DNA replication and RNA synthesis. Cytotoxicity can occur at any stage of the cell cycle, but cells
are most vulnerable to the actions of these drugs in the G1 and S phases.
2.  Pharmacokinetics
These agents are administered via IV infusion. Cisplatin and carboplatin can also be given intraperitoneally for
ovarian cancer and intra-arterially to perfuse other organs. The highest concentrations of the drugs are found in the
liver, kidney, and intestinal, testicular, and ovarian cells, but little penetrates into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The
renal route is the main pathway of excretion.
3.  Adverse effects
Severe nausea and vomiting occurs in most patients after administration of cisplatin and may continue for as long as
5 days. Premedication with antiemetic agents is required. The major limiting toxicity is dose-related nephrotoxicity,
involving the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts. This can be prevented by aggressive hydration. Other
toxicities include ototoxicity with high-frequency hearing loss and tinnitus. Unlike cisplatin, carboplatin causes only
mild nausea and vomiting, and it is rarely nephro-, neuro-, or ototoxic. The dose-limiting toxicity is
myelosuppression. Oxaliplatin has a distinct adverse effect of cold-induced peripheral neuropathy that usually
resolves within 72 hours of administration. It also causes myelosuppression and cumulative peripheral neuropathy.
Hepatotoxicity has also been reported. These agents may cause hypersensitivity reactions ranging from skin rashes
to anaphylaxis.

IX.  Topoisomerase Inhibitors
These agents exert their mechanism of action via inhibition of topoisomerase enzymes, a class of enzymes that
reduce supercoiling of DNA (Figure 35.28).

intravenous; N = nausea; PO = oral administration; V = vomiting.

A.  Camptothecins
Camptothecins are plant alkaloids originally isolated from the Chinese tree Camptotheca. Irinotecan [eye-rin-oh-
TEE-kan] and topotecan [toe-poe-TEE-kan] are semisynthetic derivatives of camptothecin [camp-toe-THEE-sin].
Topotecan is used in metastatic ovarian cancer when primary therapy has failed and also in the treatment of small
cell lung cancer. Irinotecan is used with 5-FU and leucovorin for the treatment of colorectal carcinoma.
1.  Mechanism of action
These drugs are S-phase specific and inhibit topoisomerase I, which is essential for the replication of DNA in human
cells (Figure 35.29). SN-38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan) is approximately 1000 times as potent as irinotecan
as an inhibitor of topoisomerase I. The topoisomerases relieve torsional strain in DNA by causing reversible, single-
strand breaks.

Figure 35.29 Action of type I DNA topoisomerases.
2.  Adverse effects
Bone marrow suppression, particularly neutropenia, is the dose-limiting toxicity for topotecan. Frequent blood
counts should be performed in patients receiving this drug. Myelosuppression is also seen with irinotecan. Acute
1359

and delayed diarrhea with irinotecan may be severe and require treatment with atropine during the infusion or high
doses of loperamide in the days following the infusion.

--- PAGE 1361 ---

B.  Etoposide
Etoposide [e-toe-POE-side] is a semisynthetic derivative of the plant alkaloid, podophyllotoxin. This agent blocks
cells in the late S to G2 phase of the cell cycle, and the major target is topoisomerase II. Binding of the drug to the
enzyme–DNA complex results in persistence of the transient, cleavable form of the complex and, thus, renders it
susceptible to irreversible double-strand breaks (Figure 35.30). Etoposide finds its major clinical use in the treatment
of lung cancer and in combination with bleomycin and cisplatin for testicular carcinoma. Etoposide may be
administered either IV or orally. Dose-limiting myelosuppression (primarily leukopenia) is the major toxicity.

X.  Antibodies
Monoclonal antibodies (Figure 35.31) are an active area of drug development for anticancer therapy and other
nonneoplastic diseases, because they are directed at specific targets and often have different adverse effect profiles
as compared to traditional chemotherapy agents. [Note: Monoclonal antibodies also find application in a number of
other disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis.] All of these agents are
administered intravenously, and infusion-related reactions are common.

XI.  Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors
The tyrosine kinases are a family of enzymes that are involved in several important processes within a cell,
including signal transduction and cell division. [Note: At least 50 tyrosine kinases mediate cell growth or division by
phosphorylation of signaling proteins. They have been implicated in the development of many neoplasms.] The
tyrosine kinase inhibitors are administered orally, and these agents have a wide variety of applications in the
treatment of cancer (Figure 35.32).

--- PAGE 1365 ---

XII.  Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy with intravenous immune checkpoint inhibitors is a rapidly evolving option for cancer treatment.
The goal of immune checkpoint inhibitors is to block the checkpoint molecules, such as the programmed death (PD-
1) receptor, that normally help to keep the immune system in check. By blocking these molecules, the immune
system is better able to attack the tumor and cause destruction. The two most commonly used checkpoint inhibitors
are pembrolizumab [PEM-broe-LIZ-ue-mab] and nivolumab [nye-VOL-ue-mab]. The adverse reaction profiles of
these agents consist of potentially severe and even fatal immune-mediated adverse events. This is because turning
off the immune checkpoints allows attack of the tumor, but can also lead to unchecked autoimmune response to
normal tissues. Adverse events include diarrhea, colitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, nephritis, neurotoxicity,
dermatologic toxicity in the form of severe skin rashes, and endocrinopathies such as hypo- or hyperthyroidism.
Patients should be closely monitored for the potential development of signs and symptoms of toxicity and promptly
treated with corticosteroids if necessary.

--- PAGE 1367 ---

A.  Abiraterone acetate
Abiraterone [ab-er-AT-er-own] acetate is an oral agent used in the treatment of metastatic castration–resistant
prostate cancer. Abiraterone acetate is used in conjunction with prednisone to inhibit the CYP17 enzyme (an
enzyme required for androgen synthesis), resulting in reduced testosterone production. Coadministration with
prednisone is required to help lessen the effects of mineralocorticoid excess resulting from CYP17 inhibition.
Hepatotoxicity may occur, and patients should be closely monitored for hypertension, hypokalemia, and fluid
retention. Joint and muscle discomfort, hot flushes, and diarrhea are common adverse effects with this agent.

--- PAGE 1368 ---

B.  Immunomodulating agents
Thalidomide [tha-LID-oh-mide], lenalidomide [LEN-a-LID-oh-mide], and pomalidomide [pom-a-LID-oh-mide] are
oral agents used in the treatment of multiple myeloma. Their exact mechanism of action is not clear, but they
possess antimyeloma properties including antiangiogenic, immune-modulation, anti-inflammatory and
antiproliferative effects. These agents are often combined with dexamethasone or other chemotherapeutic agents.
Adverse effects include thromboembolism, myelosuppression, fatigue, rash, and constipation. Thalidomide was
previously given to pregnant women to prevent morning sickness. However, severe birth defects were prevalent in
children born to mothers who used thalidomide. Because of their structurally similarities to thalidomide,
lenalidomide and pomalidomide are contraindicated in pregnancy.

C.  Proteasome inhibitors
Bortezomib [bore-TEZ-o-mib], ixazomib [ix-az-O-mib], and carfilzomib [kar-FIL-zo-mib] are proteasome inhibitors
commonly used as the backbone therapy in the treatment of multiple myeloma. These agents work by inhibiting
proteasomes, which in turn prevents the degradation of proapoptotic factors, thus leading to a promotion in
programmed cell death (apoptosis). Malignant cells readily depend on suppression of the apoptotic pathway;
therefore, proteasome inhibition works well in multiple myeloma. Bortezomib can be administered IV, but the
subcutaneous route is preferred because it is associated with less neuropathy. Other adverse effects include
myelosuppression, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, and herpes zoster reactivation. Patients should receive antiviral
prophylaxis if they are receiving therapy with bortezomib. Ixazomib is an oral agent with an adverse effect profile
similar to bortezomib. Carfilzomib is administered intravenously, and common adverse effects include
myelosuppression, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, and fever.

35.6Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
A patient is about to undergo three cycles of chemotherapy prior to surgery for bladder cancer. Which best
describes chemotherapy in this setting?
A.  Adjuvant
B.  Neoadjuvant
C.  Palliative
D.  Maintenance
Correct answer = B. Chemotherapy given before the surgical procedure in an attempt to shrink the cancer is
referred to as neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is indicated when neoplasms are disseminated and are
not amenable to surgery (palliative). Chemotherapy is also used as a supplemental treatment to attack
micrometastases following surgery and radiation treatment, in which case it is called adjuvant chemotherapy.
Chemotherapy given in lower doses to assist in prolonging a remission is known as maintenance chemotherapy.
A 45-year-old man is being treated with ABVD chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma. He presents for cycle
4 of a planned 6 cycles with a new-onset cough. He states it started a week ago and he also feels like he has a
little trouble catching his breath. Which drug in the ABVD regimen is the most likely cause of his pulmonary
toxicity?
A.  Doxorubicin (Adriamycin)
B.  Bleomycin
C.  Vinblastine
D.  Dacarbazine
Correct answer = B. Pulmonary toxicity is the most serious adverse effect of bleomycin, progressing from rales,
cough, and infiltrate to potentially fatal fibrosis. The pulmonary fibrosis that is caused by bleomycin is often
referred as “bleomycin lung.”
A patient is about to begin therapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Which test should be ordered
for baseline assessment before treatment?
A.  Baseline PFTs
B.  Baseline stress test
C.  Baseline echocardiogram
D.  Baseline urinalysis
Correct answer = C. Irreversible, dose-dependent cardiotoxicity, apparently a result of the generation of free
radicals and lipid peroxidation, is the most serious adverse reaction of anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin.
Cardiac function should be assessed prior to therapy, and then periodically throughout therapy.
A 64-year-old man is scheduled to undergo chemotherapy for rhabdomyosarcoma, and the regimen includes
ifosfamide. Which is most appropriate to include in chemotherapy orders for this patient?
A.  IV hydration, mesna, and frequent urinalyses
B.  Leucovorin and frequent urinalyses
C.  Allopurinol and frequent urinalyses
D.  IV hydration, prophylactic antibiotics, and frequent urinalyses
Correct answer = A. A unique toxicity of ifosfamide is hemorrhagic cystitis. This bladder toxicity has been
attributed to toxic metabolites of ifosfamide. Adequate hydration as well as IV injection of mesna (sodium 2-
mercaptoethane sulfonate), which neutralizes the toxic metabolites, can minimize this problem. Frequent
urinalyses to monitor for red blood cells should be ordered. Leucovorin is used with methotrexate or 5-FU (not
ifosfamide). Allopurinol has a drug interaction with ifosfamide and is not an agent that prevents hemorrhagic
cystitis. IV fluids are correct; however, mesna is also needed.
Development of signs of which condition should be monitored in patients receiving chemotherapy with
ifosfamide?
A.  Hand-foot syndrome
B.  Rash
C.  Cardiotoxicity
D.  Neurotoxicity
Correct answer = D. A fairly high incidence of neurotoxicity has been reported in patients on high-dose
ifosfamide, probably due to the metabolite, chloroacetaldehyde. Hand-foot syndrome is an adverse effect of 5-FU
and derivatives. Rash is possible with many drugs, but is not the most appropriate answer here. Cardiotoxicity is
an adverse effect of the anthracyclines.

35.9
35.10and severe nausea and vomiting?
A.  Cyclophosphamide
B.  Oxaliplatin
C.  Etoposide
D.  Cisplatin
Correct answer = D. Cisplatin can cause renal failure, neuropathy, hearing loss, electrolyte wasting, and
significant nausea and vomiting. Oxaliplatin rarely causes ototoxicity or nephrotoxicity. Cyclophosphamide and
etoposide have myelosuppression as the dose-limiting toxicity.
A patient was mistakenly administered vincristine instead of cytarabine intrathecally. What is the likely
outcome of this drug error?
A.  Neuropathy
B.  Death
C.  Renal failure
D.  Hearing loss
Correct answer = B. Death. Vincristine is fatal if given intrathecally.
The appearance of a facial rash with cetuximab is associated with a(n)
A.  Negative response to therapy.
B.  Positive response to therapy.
C.  Drug allergy.
D.  Infusion reaction.
Correct answer = B. Patients undergoing therapy with an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor such
as cetuximab often develop an acneiform-like rash on the face, chest, upper back, and arms. The appearance of
such a rash has been correlated with an increased response as compared to patients who do not experience a rash
during therapy.
Which of the following should be administered prior to an infusion of the monoclonal antibody rituximab?
A.  Allopurinol and acetaminophen.
B.  Folic acid and H2 receptor antagonist.
C.  Antihistamine and acetaminophen.
D.  Hepatitis B vaccine and vitamin B12.
Correct answer = C. Patients receiving rituximab may experience an infusion reaction, usually on the first cycle.
Hypotension, bronchospasm, and angioedema may occur. Chills and fever may occur, especially in patients with
high circulating levels of neoplastic cells, because of rapid activation of complement, which results in the release
of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukins. Pretreatment with diphenhydramine, acetaminophen, and
corticosteroids and a slower infusion rate can lessen the chance of this reaction.
Patients should receive antiviral prophylaxis for herpes zoster while undergoing treatment with which agent
for multiple myeloma?
A.  Dabrafenib

I.  Overview
The importance of the immune system in protecting the body against harmful foreign molecules is well recognized.
The immune system is one of the most complex organ systems in the body, which can make it difficult to
manipulate. Immunosuppressants are drugs that reduce the activation or efficacy of the immune system to treat
certain conditions, such as autoimmune diseases, or to lower the body’s ability to reject a transplanted organ.
Autoimmune diseases can arise when the immune system mistakenly identifies an individual’s own tissues as
foreign and directs a destructive response against them. The goal of treatment for these diseases is to use drug
therapy to stop this inappropriate and harmful process. In the case of organ transplantation, foreign tissue is
purposely implanted into the recipient, but the goal remains the same—to use drug therapy to limit the damage
inflicted by the immune system and potential rejection of the transplanted organ. Transplantation of organs and
tissues (for example, kidney, heart, or bone marrow) has become routine due to improved surgical techniques and
better tissue typing. Available drugs now more selectively inhibit rejection of transplanted tissues while preventing
the patient from immunological compromise and prolonging the life of transplanted organs ( Figure 36.1). Earlier
drugs were nonselective, and patients frequently succumbed to infection due to suppression of both the antibody-
mediated (humoral) and cell-mediated arms of the immune system. Today, the principal approach to
immunosuppressive therapy is to alter lymphocyte function using drugs or antibodies against immune proteins.
Because of their severe toxicities when used as monotherapy, a combination of immunosuppressive agents, usually
at lower doses, is generally employed. Immunosuppressive drug regimens typically consist of two to four agents
with different mechanisms of action that disrupt various levels of T-cell activation. [Note: Although this chapter
focuses on immunosuppressive agents in the context of organ transplantation, these agents may be used in the
treatment of other disorders. For example, cyclosporine may be useful in the treatment of psoriasis, and various
monoclonal antibodies have applications in a number of disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis,
Crohn disease, and ulcerative colitis.]

Figure 36.1 Immunosuppressant drugs. mTOR = mammalian target of rapamycin.
The immune activation cascade can be described as a three-signal model ( Figure 36.2). Signal 1 constitutes T-cell
triggering at the CD3 receptor complex by an antigen on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell (APC). Signal 1
alone is insufficient for T-cell activation and requires signal 2. Signal 2, also referred to as costimulation, occurs
when CD80 and CD86 (also known as B7.1 and B7.2) on the surface of APCs engage CD28 on T cells. Both signals
1 and 2 activate several intracellular signal transduction pathways, one of which is the calcium–calcineurin pathway.
These pathways trigger the production of cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-2. IL-2 then binds to the IL-2 receptor
(also known as CD25) on the surface of other T cells, thereby providing signal 3, activating the cell cycle via
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and leading to T-cell proliferation.1374

factor of activated T cells; mRNA = messenger RNA cells.
Immunosuppressants can be broadly categorized by their place in therapy and their mechanism of action. More
potent immunosuppressant drugs, such as monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, are often used in induction therapy,
which powerfully suppresses the immune system at the time of transplant, allowing the new organ to start
functioning in the recipient and preventing early graft rejection. Maintenance immunosuppressant drugs, on the
other hand, are less potent and provide long-term immunological protection for the transplanted organs, with lower
risk of infection than with the induction drugs. As noted above, maintenance immunosuppressant medications are
frequently combined in regimens to maintain adequate immunosuppression while minimizing adverse effects.

II.  Induction and Rejection Immunosuppressant Medications
The use of antibodies plays a central role in prolonging allograft survival. [Note: An allograft is a transplant of an
organ or tissue from one person to another who is not genetically identical.] Antibodies are prepared by
immunization of either rabbits or horses with human lymphoid cells (producing a mixture of polyclonal antibodies
or monoclonal antibodies) or by hybridoma technology (producing antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies).
Hybridomas are produced by fusing mouse antibody-producing cells with tumor cells. Hybrid cells are selected and
cloned, and the antibody specificity of the clones is determined. Clones of interest can be cultured in large quantities
to produce clinically useful amounts of the desired antibody. Recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) technology
can also be used to replace part of the mouse gene sequence with human genetic material, thus “humanizing” the
antibodies and making them less antigenic. The names of monoclonal antibodies conventionally contain “xi” or “zu”
if they are chimerized or humanized, respectively. The suffix “-mab” (monoclonal antibody) identifies the category
of drug. The polyclonal antibodies, although relatively inexpensive to produce, are variable and less specific, which
is in contrast to monoclonal antibodies, which are homogeneous and specific (Figure 36.3).

A.  Antithymocyte globulins
Antithymocyte globulins are polyclonal antibodies produced by isolating gamma-globulin fractions of serum
obtained from rabbits or horses after immunization with human thymocytes. They cause depletion of circulating T
cells and apoptosis of activated T cells. Rabbit preparations are preferred over horse preparations because of greater
potency and less toxicity.
Antithymocyte globulin (rabbit) is primarily used at the time of transplantation to prevent early allograft
rejection, along with other immunosuppressive agents. It may also be used to treat severe rejection episodes or
corticosteroid-resistant acute rejection. It is usually used for 3 to 10 days to produce profound lymphopenia that may
last beyond 1 year.
The antibodies are slowly infused intravenously and their half-life extends from 3 to 9 days. Premedication with
corticosteroids, acetaminophen, and antihistamines may help reduce infusion-related reactions. Prolonged use may
be associated with profound immunosuppression and an increased risk of opportunistic infections and/or
posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD).

--- PAGE 1378 ---

B.  Basiliximab
Basiliximab [bass-il-IX-im-ab] is a chimeric murine/human monoclonal antibody that binds to the α chain of the IL-
2 receptor (CD25) on activated T cells and, thus, interferes with the proliferation of these cells. Blockade of this
receptor foils the ability of any antigenic stimulus to activate the T-cell response system.
Basiliximab is approved for prophylaxis of acute rejection in renal transplantation in combination with
cyclosporine and corticosteroids. This may allow for reduced doses or delayed introduction of calcineurin inhibitors.
The drug may be beneficial in those with delayed graft function and may reduce the risk of calcineurin inhibitor–
associated renal toxicity. Basiliximab is not T-cell depleting and, therefore, is mainly used in induction protocols as
opposed to the treatment of rejection. Basiliximab is given as an IV infusion. The serum half-life of basiliximab is
about 7 days. Usually, two doses of this drug are administered—the first at 2 hours prior to transplantation and the
second at 4 days after the surgery. The drug is generally well tolerated.

--- PAGE 1379 ---

C.  Alemtuzumab
Alemtuzumab [AL-em-TOOZ-ue-mab] is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to CD52 on both T and B
cells, resulting in depletion of both lymphoid cell lines. Depletion of T and B cells is observed soon after infusion
and recovery of these cells is gradual. T cells recover over 6 to 12 months, and B cells recover in 6 months or less. It
is approved for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but has been used in transplantation as an induction
and antirejection agent for both acute cellular rejection and antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) due to its activity
against both T and B cells. Because of the potent and prolonged immunosuppressive effect, it is recommended to
initiate or continue prophylaxis for Pneumocystis pneumonia and herpes viruses after administration of
alemtuzumab.
Alemtuzumab was removed from the US market by the manufacturer in 2012 in preparation for relabeling for
use in multiple sclerosis, but it can still be obtained through the Campath Distribution Program for use in transplant
patients.

D.  Rituximab
Rituximab [ri-TUX-i-mab] is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against the antigen CD20 on pre-B cells, mature B
cells, and memory B cells. Rituximab causes B-cell depletion by inducing B-cell lysis and blocking B-cell activation
and eventual maturation to antibody-forming plasma cells. Existing plasma cells do not express the CD20 antigen
and, therefore, are unaffected by rituximab. The drug is approved for use in the treatment of B-cell lymphomas,
PTLD, and rheumatoid arthritis. The benefit of using rituximab in transplantation is for antibody removal, which has
been utilized in ABO (blood type) incompatible transplants, desensitization protocols, and treatment of AMR.
Intravenous administration of rituximab leads to rapid and sustained depletion of B lymphocytes, with B-cell
counts returning to normal within 9 to 12 months. Rituximab has a boxed warning for reactivation of JC virus
leading to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which has been reported in the nontransplant
population. Activation of hepatitis B infection has also been reported following treatment, and hepatitis serologies
should be monitored.

--- PAGE 1381 ---

E.  Bortezomib
AMR involves the production of high levels of antibodies by plasma cells, either newly made from B cells or from
those that existed prior to transplant. One mechanism to control AMR is to target antibody production by plasma
cells. Bortezomib [bor-TEZ-oh-mib] is a proteasome inhibitor that leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of normal
plasma cells, thereby decreasing antibody production in sensitized patients.
Bortezomib is approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma, but it has been adapted for use in the treatment
of AMR in transplant patients. It can be administered via intravenous bolus or subcutaneous injection, so it has a low
potential for infusion-related reactions. Bortezomib is metabolized primarily by cytochrome P450 enzymes and
hepatic dysfunction has rarely been reported when multiple cycles are given.

--- PAGE 1382 ---

F.  Intravenous immunoglobulin
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) contains immunoglobulins prepared by human plasma pooled from many
donors. It has an immunomodulatory effect and is often used for autoimmune diseases, pretransplant desensitization
protocols, and treatment of AMR. The immunomodulatory effects on T and B cells occur at high doses, and it is also
used at lower doses to prevent infection by replacing immunoglobulins removed during plasmapheresis. The
mechanism of action is not well defined, but high doses of IVIG appear to induce B-cell apoptosis and modulate B-
cell signaling. It also inhibits binding of antibodies to the transplanted graft and activation of the complement
system. The serum half-life of IVIG is about 3 to 4 weeks.
Adverse effects of IVIG include headache, fever, chills, myalgias, and hypotension/hypertension, which can be
reduced by slowing the infusion rate. Serious adverse effects are rare and can include aseptic meningitis, acute renal
failure, and thrombotic events.

III.  Maintenance Immunosuppressant Medications
Maintenance immunosuppressants are intended to provide adequate immunosuppression to prevent allograft
rejection, while minimizing infection, malignancy, and drug-induced adverse effects. Often they are combined in
regimens of two to four drugs, using medications with different mechanisms of action to minimize drug toxicity.
These drugs can be further divided into four main classes: 1) calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine and tacrolimus), 2)
costimulation blockers (belatacept ), 3) mTOR inhibitors (sirolimus and everolimus), and 4) antiproliferatives
(mycophenolate and azathioprine) (Figure 36.4).

drug interaction; GVHD = graft versus host disease; HLD = hyperlipidemia; HTN =
hypertension; mTOR = mammalian target of rapamycin; RA = rheumatoid arthritis; SOT
= solid organ transplant; TC = total cholesterol; TG = triglycerides.
1383

--- PAGE 1384 ---

A.  Calcineurin inhibitors
Calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine [sye-kloe-SPOR-een] and tacrolimus [tac-RO-li-mus] block signal transduction
through the calcium–calcineurin pathway, activated downstream of signal 1, to impair T-cell activation. Calcineurin,
a calcium-dependent protein phosphatase, dephosphorylates nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), allowing
NFAT to enter the T-cell nucleus and bind to DNA, leading to transcription and production of cytokines, including
IL-2. Cyclosporine binds to cyclophilin, whereas tacrolimus binds a protein called FK-binding protein (FKBP).
These drug–protein complexes inhibit the activity of calcineurin, thereby preventing T-cell activation (see Figure
36.2). Tacrolimus is the preferred calcineurin inhibitor due to its decreased rate of allograft rejection as compared to
cyclosporine. Although it is approved for renal, liver, and heart transplant, tacrolimus is the mainstay of
maintenance immunosuppressants for all solid organ transplants.
Enzymes CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and liver are
responsible for the interindividual variability in oral absorption and metabolism of cyclosporine and tacrolimus.
Dosing titration is based on 12-hour trough levels, with goal trough levels varying between different organs, time
from transplant, and transplant center-specific protocols.
One of the primary limitations to the use of calcineurin inhibitors is nephrotoxicity, which has led to the
development of regimens using these agents in combination with other immunosuppressant drugs. As with all
immunosuppressants, infections are possible with use of calcineurin inhibitors, and recipients are often given
prophylactic medications posttransplant. Hirsutism, or excessive hair growth, is a common adverse effect of
cyclosporine.
1384

--- PAGE 1385 ---

B.  Costimulation blocker
Belatacept  [bel-a-TA-sept], a second-generation costimulation blocker, is a recombinant fusion protein of CTLA-4,
which like CD28, binds to CD80 and CD86 on APCs. Binding of belatacept  to CD80 and CD86 prevents CD28
from binding to those molecules and, thus, inhibits signal 2 of the T-cell activation pathway. Belatacept  is approved
for kidney transplantation in combination with basiliximab, mycophenolate mofetil , and corticosteroids. This drug
can substitute for calcineurin inhibitors to avoid the detrimental long-term nephrotoxic, cardiovascular, and
metabolic complications seen with cyclosporine and tacrolimus. [Note: The first-generation costimulation blocker
abatacept  is approved for rheumatoid arthritis.]
Belatacept  is the first IV maintenance immunosuppressant and is dosed in two phases. Initially, it is
administered four times in the first month at a higher dose to build up drug levels and then decreased to once-
monthly dosing. After 4 months, the dose is also decreased. Monthly dosing may be beneficial in patients for whom
medication compliance is an issue. Clearance of belatacept  is not affected by age, sex, race, renal, or hepatic
function. Belatacept  increases the risk of PTLD, particularly of the central nervous system. Therefore, it is
contraindicated in patients who are seronegative to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a common cause of PTLD.
Serological titers to EBV are typically obtained to confirm exposure.

--- PAGE 1386 ---

C.  mTOR inhibitors
Sirolimus [sih-RO-lih-mus] (also known as rapamycin) and everolimus [e-ve-RO-lih-mus] inhibit the protein
mTOR, blocking the signal transduction pathway activated by signal 3. Progression into the cell cycle and T-cell
proliferation is subsequently prevented (Figure 36.5). The mTOR inhibitors are commonly used in multidrug
regimens, frequently to minimize the dose of calcineurin inhibitors and spare their nephrotoxic adverse effects.
Figure 36.5 Mechanism of action of sirolimus and everolimus. FKBP = FK-binding
protein; IL = interleukin; mRNA = messenger RNA; mTOR = mammalian target of
rapamycin.
Like the calcineurin inhibitors, both sirolimus and everolimus are metabolized by CYP3A4, are substrates for P-gp,
and are subject to numerous drug–drug interactions. Both agents require drug monitoring of trough concentrations to
1386
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1387 ---

optimize therapy. Sirolimus has a longer half-life than the calcineurin inhibitors or everolimus, and is dosed only
once daily, which may improve medication compliance. The antiproliferative action of sirolimus is also valuable in
cardiology where sirolimus-coated stents are used to inhibit restenosis of the blood vessels by reducing proliferation
of the endothelial cells. Everolimus is also used in oncology to treat many different types of cancer, including breast,
renal cell, and neuroendocrine tumors. However, the doses for tumor treatment are higher than those used in
transplantation.

--- PAGE 1388 ---

D.  Antiproliferatives
The antiproliferatives azathioprine [ay-za-THYE-oh-preen] and mycophenolate [mye-koe-FEN-oh-late] block
lymphocyte proliferation by inhibiting nucleic acid synthesis. Azathioprine, which was one of the first agents to
achieve widespread use in organ transplantation, is a prodrug that is converted first to 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP ) and
then to the corresponding nucleotide analog, thioinosinic acid. The analog is incorporated into nucleic acid chains
and blocks further elongation of the DNA. Mycophenolate is a potent, reversible, noncompetitive inhibitor of
inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, which blocks the de novo formation of guanosine monophosphate (Figure
36.6). Because lymphocytes are unable to utilize the salvage pathway of nucleotide synthesis, mycophenolate
effectively blocks T- and B-cell proliferation by eliminating de novo production of guanosine monophosphate.
Figure 36.6 Mechanism of action of mycophenolate. IMP = inosine-5′-monophosphate;
GMP = guanosine monophosphate.
These medications are used as adjunctive immunosuppressant agents, primarily with calcineurin inhibitors with or
without corticosteroids. However, mycophenolate has largely replaced azathioprine in this role due to its improved
safety and efficacy profile. The main dose-limiting adverse effect of azathioprine is bone marrow suppression.
Allopurinol  inhibits the metabolism of azathioprine, thereby enhancing the adverse effects of azathioprine. Thus,
concomitant use of allopurinol  requires a significant reduction in azathioprine dose.
Mycophenolate is available in two formulations—as a prodrug mycophenolate mofetil  and as an active drug
mycophenolic acid. Mycophenolate mofetil  is rapidly hydrolyzed in the gastrointestinal tract to mycophenolic acid.
Glucuronidation of mycophenolic acid in the liver produces an inactive metabolite, but enterohepatic recirculation
occurs, prolonging the effect of the drug. Mycophenolic acid is an enteric-coated tablet designed to theoretically
reduce the gastrointestinal upset commonly experienced with mycophenolate mofetil .

--- PAGE 1389 ---

E.  Corticosteroids
The corticosteroids (see Chapter 26) were the first pharmacologic agents to be used as immunosuppressives, both in
transplantation and in various autoimmune disorders. They are still one of the mainstays for attenuating rejection
episodes. For transplantation, the most common agents are prednisone and methylprednisolone, whereas prednisone
and prednisolone are used for autoimmune conditions. [Note: In transplantation, they are used in combination with
agents described previously in this chapter.] The steroids are used to suppress acute rejection of solid organ
allografts and in chronic graft versus host disease. In addition, they are effective against a wide variety of
autoimmune conditions, including refractory rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, temporal arteritis,
and asthma. The exact mechanism responsible for the immunosuppressive action of the corticosteroids is unclear.
The T lymphocytes are most affected. The steroids are able to rapidly reduce lymphocyte populations by lysis or
redistribution. On entering cells, they bind to the glucocorticoid receptor. The complex passes into the nucleus and
regulates the transcription of DNA. Among the genes affected are those involved in inflammatory responses. The
use of these agents is associated with numerous adverse effects. For example, they are diabetogenic and can cause
hypercholesterolemia, cataracts, osteoporosis, and hypertension with prolonged use. Consequently, efforts are being
directed toward reducing or eliminating the use of steroids in the maintenance of allografts.

36.6Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
A 45-year-old man who received a renal transplant 3 months ago and is being maintained on tacrolimus,
prednisone, and mycophenolate mofetil is found to have increased creatinine levels and a kidney biopsy
indicates severe rejection. Which course of therapy would be appropriate?
A.  Increased dose of prednisone.
B.  Treatment with rabbit antithymocyte globulin.
C.  Treatment with sirolimus.
D.  Treatment with azathioprine.
Correct answer = B. This patient is apparently undergoing an acute rejection of the kidney. The most effective
treatment would be administration of an antibody. Increasing the dose of prednisone may have some effect but
would not be enough to treat the rejection. Sirolimus is used prophylactically with cyclosporine to prevent renal
rejection but is less effective when an episode is occurring. Azathioprine has no benefit over mycophenolate.
Which combination of immunosuppressive drugs should be avoided?
A.  Basiliximab, belatacept, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone.
B.  Tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone.
C.  Tacrolimus, cyclosporine, and prednisone.
D.  Tacrolimus, sirolimus, and prednisone.
Correct answer = C. Tacrolimus and cyclosporine are both calcineurin inhibitors and have the same mechanism of
action. Immunosuppressive drug regimens should work synergistically at different places in the T-cell activation
cascade. Additionally, cyclosporine and tacrolimus are both extremely nephrotoxic and when used together would
cause harm to patients. All of the other combinations are reasonable.
Which drug used to prevent allograft rejection can cause hyperlipidemia?
A.  Basiliximab
B.  Belatacept
C.  Mycophenolate mofetil
D.  Sirolimus
Correct answer = D. Patients who are receiving sirolimus can develop elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels,
which can be controlled by statin therapy. None of the other agents have this adverse effect.
Which drug specifically inhibits calcineurin in the activated T lymphocytes?
A.  Basiliximab
B.  Tacrolimus
C.  Sirolimus
Correct answer = B. Tacrolimus binds to FKBP-12, which, in turn, inhibits calcineurin and interferes in the
cascade of reactions that synthesize interleukin-2 (IL-2) and lead to T-lymphocyte proliferation. Although
basiliximab also interferes with T-lymphocyte proliferation, it does so by binding to the CD25 site on the IL-2
receptor. Sirolimus, while also binding to FKBP-12, does not inhibit calcineurin. Mycophenolate mofetil exerts
its immunosuppressive action by inhibiting inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, thus depriving the cells of
guanosine monophosphate, a key precursor of nucleic acids.
An 18-year-old woman who received a kidney transplant 6 months ago comes in to clinic complaining of
facial hair growth and does not want to take an immunosuppressant anymore. Which treatment option would
be the most appropriate to address her concerns?
A.  Switch cyclosporine to tacrolimus.
B.  Switch mycophenolate mofetil to sirolimus.
C.  Stop prednisone and add methylprednisolone.
D.  Switch mycophenolate mofetil to mycophenolic acid.
Correct answer = A. Hirsutism, or excessive hair growth, is a well-known adverse effect of cyclosporine. Many
patients experience dark, coarse facial or body hair growth while taking cyclosporine. Switching cyclosporine to
tacrolimus would eliminate this adverse effect and keep the patient on a calcineurin inhibitor that is effective in
preventing rejection. Mycophenolate and prednisone are not known to cause hirsutism.
Which immunosuppressant medication avoids the need for therapeutic drug monitoring?
A.  Cyclosporine
B.  Tacrolimus
C.  Mycophenolate mofetil
D.  Sirolimus1390
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1391 ---

36.7
36.8
36.9
36.10Correct answer = C. Calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine and tacrolimus) and mTOR inhibitors (sirolimus and
everolimus) require therapeutic drug monitoring in order to maximize efficacy (prevent rejection episodes) and
minimize toxicity (adverse effects). Mycophenolate mofetil is the correct answer since there is no role for routine
monitoring with this medication.
Which clinical situation is least appropriate for immunosuppression with sirolimus?
A.  A patient with primary renal failure.
B.  A patient who has failed calcineurin inhibitors due to neurotoxicity.
C.  A patient who is 6 months postliver transplant and the incision site is fully healed.
D.  A patient with an abnormal lipid profile.
Correct answer = D. A patient with an abnormal lipid profile is a poor candidate for immunosuppression with
sirolimus, since this medication is known to cause or exacerbate hyperlipidemia, particularly triglycerides and
total cholesterol. A patient with primary renal failure would be a candidate for sirolimus, since it does not cause
nephrotoxicity as calcineurin inhibitors do. It would be appropriate to switch a patient who has failed calcineurin
inhibitors due to neurotoxicity to sirolimus for immunosuppression since it is not associated with that adverse
effect. Sirolimus is known to impair wound healing, but a patient with a fully healed incision site could
appropriately be placed on sirolimus.
Which statement is correct regarding the difference between induction immunosuppression (IS) and
maintenance IS?
A.  Maintenance IS is less important than induction IS for long-term graft survival.
B.  Induction IS is more intense than maintenance IS.
C.  Maintenance IS includes lymphocyte-depleting antibodies, while induction IS does not.
D.  Induction IS increases the risk of infection, while maintenance IS does not.
Correct answer = B. Induction IS is more intense than maintenance IS, as it provides IS during the intraoperative
and early postoperative period to combat the body’s initial immune response to the transplanted graft. Both
maintenance and induction IS are important for the long-term survival of the graft. Lymphocyte-depleting
antibodies are used as induction IS and not as maintenance. Although induction IS is more potent, all IS (both
induction and maintenance) can increase the risk of infection.
A 39-year-old man is admitted 3 months after liver transplant with increased liver function tests. A liver
biopsy is performed and the results show acute rejection, severe. The team decides to start treatment with
antithymocyte globulin, rabbit. What additional drug therapy is required for appropriate administration of
this medication?
A.  No additional medications are required.
B.  Diphenhydramine, acetaminophen.
C.  Diphenhydramine, ketorolac, corticosteroids.
D.  Diphenhydramine, acetaminophen, corticosteroids.
Correct answer = D. Infusion-related reactions are common with the administration of antithymocyte globulins
due to cytokine release. Common symptoms include chills, fever, hypotension, and pulmonary edema.
Premedication with acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, and corticosteroids should be administered 30 minutes
prior to the start of the infusion to prevent this syndrome. Although diphenhydramine and acetaminophen are
correct, corticosteroids are also needed as premedication. Ketorolac is not the most appropriate for use as
premedication for antithymocyte globulin.
A 21-year-old woman is admitted to receive a kidney transplant from her father. Since she has a low-to-
moderate risk of rejection, she will receive induction with the antibody basiliximab. Which statement
indicates the uniqueness of the therapy she is receiving compared with other antibody agents?
A.  Basiliximab is generally well tolerated and does not require premedications prior to administration.
B.  Basiliximab binds to CD52 and targets B and T lymphocytes.
C.  Basiliximab is used only in combination with antithymocyte globulin.
D.  Basiliximab targets B cells, not T cells.
Correct answer = A. Basiliximab does not require premedication since it is a nondepleting agent and would not be
expected to cause cytokine release or infusion reactions. It can be used in combination with antithymocyte
globulin, but most commonly it is used alone. Basiliximab binds to CD25 (not CD52) and affects T cells. It does
not have any effect on B cells.1391

I.  Overview
Histamine and serotonin, along with prostaglandins, belong to a group of endogenous compounds called autacoids.
These heterogeneous substances have widely differing structures and pharmacologic activities. They all have the
common feature of being formed by the tissues on which they act and, therefore, function as local hormones. [Note:
The word “autacoid” comes from the Greek: autos (self) and akos (medicinal agent, or remedy).] The autacoids also
differ from circulating hormones in that they are produced by many tissues rather than in specific endocrine glands.
The drugs described in this chapter are either autacoids or autacoid antagonists (compounds that inhibit the synthesis
of certain autacoids or that interfere with their interactions with receptors).

II.  Histamine
Histamine is a chemical messenger mostly generated in mast cells. Histamine, via multiple receptor systems,
mediates a wide range of cellular responses, including allergic and inflammatory reactions, gastric acid secretion,
and neurotransmission in parts of the brain. Histamine has no clinical applications, but agents that inhibit the action
of histamine (antihistamines or histamine receptor blockers) have important therapeutic applications. Figure 37.1
provides a summary of the antihistamines.

A.  Location, synthesis, and release of histamine
1.  Location
Histamine is present in practically all tissues, with significant amounts in the lungs, skin, blood vessels, and
gastrointestinal (GI) tract. It is found in high concentrations in mast cells and basophils. Histamine functions as a
neurotransmitter in the brain. It also occurs as a component of venoms and in secretions from insect stings.
2.  Synthesis
Histamine is an amine formed by the decarboxylation of the amino acid histidine by the enzyme histidine
decarboxylase, which is expressed in cells throughout the body, including neurons, gastric parietal cells, mast cells,
and basophils (Figure 37.2). In mast cells, histamine is stored in granules. If histamine is not stored, it is rapidly
inactivated by the enzyme amine oxidase.
Figure 37.2 Biosynthesis of histamine.
3.  Release of histamine
Most often, histamine is just one of several chemical mediators released in response to stimuli. The stimuli for
release of histamine from tissues may include destruction of cells as a result of cold, toxins from organisms, venoms
from insects and spiders, and trauma. Allergies and anaphylaxis can also trigger significant release of histamine.
1397
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1398 ---

B.  Mechanism of action
Histamine released in response to certain stimuli exerts its effects by binding to various types of histamine receptors
(H1, H2, H3, and H4). H1 and H2 receptors are widely expressed and are the targets of clinically useful drugs.
Histamine has a wide range of pharmacologic effects that are mediated by both H1 and H2 receptors. For example,
the H1 receptors are important in producing smooth muscle contraction and increasing capillary permeability ( Figure
37.3). Histamine promotes vasodilation of small blood vessels by causing the vascular endothelium to release nitric
oxide. In addition, histamine can enhance the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in several cell types and in
local tissues. Histamine H1 receptors mediate many pathological processes, including allergic rhinitis, atopic
dermatitis, conjunctivitis, urticaria, bronchoconstriction, asthma, and anaphylaxis. Moreover, histamine stimulates
the parietal cells in the stomach, causing an increase in acid secretion via the activation of H2 receptors.

--- PAGE 1401 ---

C.  Role in allergy and anaphylaxis
The symptoms resulting from intravenous injection of histamine are similar to those associated with anaphylactic
shock and allergic reactions. These include contraction of airway smooth muscle, stimulation of secretions, dilation
and increased permeability of the capillaries, and stimulation of sensory nerve endings. Symptoms associated with
allergy and anaphylactic shock result from the release of certain mediators from their storage sites. Such mediators
include histamine, serotonin, leukotrienes, and the eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis. In some cases,
these mediators cause a localized allergic reaction, producing, for example, actions on the skin or respiratory tract.
Under other conditions, these mediators may cause a full-blown anaphylactic response. It is thought that the
difference between these two situations results from differences in the sites from which mediators are released and
in their rates of release. For example, if the release of histamine is slow enough to permit its inactivation before it
enters the bloodstream, a local allergic reaction results. However, if histamine release is too fast for efficient
inactivation, a full-blown anaphylactic reaction occurs.

III.  H 1 Antihistamines
The term antihistamine refers primarily to the classic H1-receptor blockers. The H1-receptor blockers can be divided
into first- and second-generation drugs (Figure 37.4). The older first-generation drugs are still widely used because
they are effective and inexpensive. However, most of these drugs penetrate the central nervous system (CNS) and
cause sedation. Furthermore, they tend to interact with other receptors, producing a variety of unwanted adverse
effects. By contrast, the second-generation agents are specific for peripheral H1 receptors. The second-generation
antihistamines are made polar, mainly by adding carboxyl groups (for example, cetirizine is the carboxylated
derivative of hydroxyzine), and, therefore, these agents do not penetrate the blood–brain barrier and cause less CNS
depression than do the first-generation drugs. Among the second-generation agents, desloratadine [des-lor-AH-tah-
deen], fexofenadine [fex-oh-FEN-a-deen], and loratadine [lor-AT-a-deen] show the least sedation (Figure 37.5).
Cetirizine [seh-TEER-ih-zeen] and levocetirizine [lee-voe-seh-TEER-ih-zeen] are partially sedating second-
generation agents.

generation H1 antihistamines.

--- PAGE 1405 ---

A.  Actions
The action of all H1-receptor blockers is qualitatively similar. Most of these compounds do not influence the
formation or release of histamine. Rather, they block the receptor-mediated response of a target tissue. They are
much more effective in preventing symptoms than reversing them once they have occurred. However, most of these
agents have additional effects unrelated to their ability to block H1 receptors. These effects reflect binding of the H1-
receptor antagonists to cholinergic, adrenergic, or serotonin receptors (Figure 37.6). For example, cyproheptadine
[SYE-proe-HEP-ta-deen] also acts as a serotonin antagonist on the appetite center, resulting in appetite stimulation.
Antihistamines such as azelastine [a-ZEL-uh-steen] and ketotifen [kee-toe-TYE-fen] also have mast cell–stabilizing
effects in addition to their histamine receptor–blocking effects.

serotonin-binding receptors. CNS = central nervous system.

--- PAGE 1406 ---

B.  Therapeutic uses
1.  Allergic and inflammatory conditions
H1-receptor blockers are useful in treating and preventing allergic reactions caused by antigens acting on
immunoglobulin E antibody. For example, oral antihistamines are the drugs of choice in controlling the symptoms
of allergic rhinitis and urticaria because histamine is the principal mediator released by mast cells. Ophthalmic
antihistamines, such as azelastine, olopatadine [oh-loe-PAT-a-deen], ketotifen, and others, are useful for the
treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. However, the H1-receptor blockers are not indicated in treating bronchial
asthma, because histamine is only one of several mediators that are responsible for causing bronchial reactions.
[Note: Epinephrine has actions on smooth muscle that are opposite to those of histamine. It acts via β2 receptors on
smooth muscle, causing cAMP-mediated relaxation. Therefore, epinephrine is the drug of choice in treating
systemic anaphylaxis and other conditions that involve massive release of histamine.]
2.  Motion sickness and nausea
Along with the antimuscarinic agent scopolamine, certain H1-receptor blockers, such as diphenhydramine [dye-fen-
HYE-dra-meen], dimenhydrinate [dye-men-HYE-dri-nate] (a chemical combination of diphenhydramine and a
chlorinated theophylline derivative), cyclizine [SYE-kli-zeen], meclizine [MEK-li-zeen], and promethazine [proe-
METH-a-zeen], are the most effective agents for prevention of the symptoms of motion sickness. They are usually
not effective if symptoms are already present and, thus, should be taken prior to expected travel. The antihistamines
prevent or diminish nausea and vomiting mediated by both the chemoreceptor and vestibular pathways. The
antiemetic action of these medications seems to be due to their blockade of central H1 and M1 muscarinic receptors.
Meclizine is also useful for the treatment of vertigo associated with vestibular disorders.
3.  Insomnia
Although they are not the medications of choice, many first-generation antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine and
doxylamine [dox-IL-a-meen], have strong sedative properties and are used in the treatment of insomnia. The use of
first-generation H1 antihistamines is contraindicated in the treatment of individuals working in jobs in which
wakefulness is critical. The second-generation antihistamines have no value as somnifacients.
1406
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1407 ---

C.  Pharmacokinetics
H1-receptor blockers are well absorbed after oral administration, with maximum serum levels occurring at 1 to 2
hours. The average plasma half-life is 4 to 6 hours, except for that of meclizine and the second-generation agents,
which is 12 to 24 hours, allowing for once-daily dosing. First-generation H1-receptor blockers are distributed in all
tissues, including the CNS. All first-generation H1 antihistamines and some second-generation H1 antihistamines,
such as desloratadine and loratadine, are metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 system. Levocetirizine is the
active enantiomer of cetirizine. Cetirizine and levocetirizine are excreted largely unchanged in urine, and
fexofenadine is excreted largely unchanged in feces. After a single oral dose, the onset of action occurs within 1 to 3
hours. Azelastine, olopatadine, ketotifen, alcaftadine [al-KAF-ta-deen], bepotastine [bep-oh-TAS-teen], and
emedastine [em-e-DAS-teen] are available in ophthalmic formulations that allow for more targeted tissue delivery.
Azelastine and olopatadine have intranasal formulations, as well.

--- PAGE 1408 ---

D.  Adverse effects
First-generation H1-receptor blockers have a low specificity, interacting not only with histamine receptors but also
with muscarinic cholinergic receptors, α-adrenergic receptors, and serotonin receptors ( Figure 37.6). The extent of
interaction with these receptors and, as a result, the nature of the side effects varies with the structure of the drug.
Some side effects may be undesirable, and others may be of therapeutic value. Furthermore, the incidence and
severity of adverse reactions for a given drug varies between individual subjects.
1.  Sedation
First-generation H1 antihistamines, such as chlorpheniramine [klor-fen-IR-a-meen], diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine
[hye-DROX-ee-zeen], and promethazine, bind to H1 receptors and block the neurotransmitter effect of histamine in
the CNS. The most frequently observed adverse reaction is sedation (Figure 37.7); however, diphenhydramine may
cause paradoxical hyperactivity in young children. Other central actions include fatigue, dizziness, lack of
coordination, and tremors. Elderly patients are more sensitive to these effects. Sedation is less common with the
second-generation drugs, since they do not readily enter the CNS. Second-generation H1 antihistamines are specific
for peripheral H1 receptors.

Figure 37.7 Some adverse effects observed with antihistamines. BP = blood pressure.
2.  Other effects
First-generation antihistamines exert anticholinergic effects, leading to dryness in the nasal passage and oral cavity.
They also may cause blurred vision and retention of urine. The most common adverse reaction associated with
second-generation antihistamines is headache. Topical formulations of diphenhydramine can cause local
hypersensitivity reactions such as contact dermatitis.
3.  Drug interactions
Interaction of H1-receptor blockers with other drugs can cause serious consequences, such as potentiation of effects
of other CNS depressants, including alcohol. Patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), for example
phenelzine, should not take antihistamines because the MAOIs can exacerbate the sedative and anticholinergic
effects of antihistamines. In addition, the first-generation antihistamines (diphenhydramine and others) with
anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) actions may decrease the effectiveness of cholinesterase inhibitors ( donepezil ,
rivastigmine, and galantamine) in the treatment of Alzheimer disease.
4.  Overdoses
Although the margin of safety of H1-receptor blockers is relatively high and chronic toxicity is rare, acute poisoning
is relatively common, especially in young children. The most common and dangerous effects of acute poisoning are
those on the CNS, including hallucinations, excitement, ataxia, and convulsions. If untreated, the patient may
experience a deepening coma and collapse of the cardiorespiratory system.

IV.  Histamine H 2-Receptor Blockers
Histamine H2-receptor blockers have little, if any, affinity for H1 receptors. Although antagonists of the histamine
H2 receptor (H2 antagonists or H2-receptor blockers) block the actions of histamine at all H2 receptors, their chief
clinical use is as inhibitors of gastric acid secretion in the treatment of ulcers and heartburn. The H2-receptor
blockers cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine, and nizatidine are discussed in Chapter 40.
1411

--- PAGE 1412 ---

V.  Serotonin
Serotonin is a neurotransmitter within the enteric nervous system and the CNS. It plays a role in vasoconstriction,
inhibition of gastric secretion, and stimulation of smooth muscle contraction. Within the GI tract, it may serve as a
local hormone to influence GI motility and secretion. Within the brain, the serotonergic neurons affect mood,
appetite, body temperature regulation, and sleep. While serotonin has no therapeutic uses, selective serotonin
agonists find clinical utility in the management of several disorders, such as depression and migraine headache.
1412
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1413 ---

A.  Location, synthesis, and release of serotonin
1.  Location
Serotonin is largely present within the enterochromaffin cells of the gastrointestinal tract. It is also found in storage
granules in platelets and the raphe nuclei of the brainstem.
2.  Synthesis
Serotonin (also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is synthesized from the amino acid L-tryptophan. L-
Tryptophan undergoes hydroxylation of the indole ring to form L-5-hydroxytryptophan, followed by decarboxylation
to form 5-hydroxytryptamine.
3.  Release of serotonin
Following synthesis, serotonin is stored in vesicles and is released by exocytosis of the vesicle in response to an
action potential. The activity of serotonin is terminated by uptake into the neuron and platelets. Metabolism occurs
mainly via monoamine oxidase.
1413
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1414 ---

B.  Mechanism of action
There are seven families of 5-HT receptors, designated by numeric subscripts 1 through 7. Most of these are G
protein–coupled receptors, while the 5-HT3 receptor is a ligand-gated cation channel. The 5-HT1 and 5-HT2
receptors have several subtypes denoted by letters (for example, 5-HT2C). Serotonin has a wide range of effects that
are mediated by the different types of serotonin receptors. For example, serotonin activity at 5-HT2C receptors in the
CNS may cause a reduction in appetite, and stimulation of 5-HT3 receptors in the GI tract and vomiting center may
trigger emesis. [Note: 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are highly effective for the management of chemotherapy-induced
or postsurgical nausea and vomiting; see Chapter 40.]
1414
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1415 ---

C.  Therapeutic Uses
Selective serotonin agonists have a variety of clinical indications, depending on the receptor specificity. Serotonin
has a role in the pathophysiology of clinical depression, and agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(SSRIs) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are effective therapies for this condition (see
Chapter 10). The clinical use of serotonin agonists in the management of migraine and obesity is further described
below.

VI.  Drugs Used to Treat Headache Disorders
The most common types of headaches are migraine, tension-type, and cluster headaches. Migraines can usually be
distinguished from cluster headaches and tension-type headaches by the characteristics as shown in Figure 37.8.
Patients with severe migraine headaches report one to five attacks per month of moderate to severe pain, which is
usually unilateral. Headache disorders significantly affect quality of life and result in considerable health care costs.
Management of headaches involves avoidance of headache triggers (for example, alcohol, chocolate, and stress) and
use of abortive treatments for acute headaches, as well as prophylactic therapy in patients with frequent or severe
migraines (Figure 37.9). Serotonin agonists (triptans and ergot alkaloids) are effective as abortive agents in the
treatment of migraines.

Figure 37.9 Summary of drugs used to treat migraine headache.
1417
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1418 ---

A.  Types of migraine
There are two main types of migraine headaches. The first, migraine without aura, is a severe, unilateral, pulsating
headache that typically lasts from 2 to 72 hours. These headaches are often aggravated by physical activity and are
accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia (hypersensitivity to light), and phonophobia (hypersensitivity to
sound). The majority of patients with migraine do not have aura. In the second type, migraine with aura, the
headache is preceded by neurologic symptoms called auras, which can be visual, sensory, and/or cause speech or
motor disturbances. Most commonly, these prodromal symptoms are visual (flashes, zigzag lines, and glare) and
occur approximately 20 to 40 minutes before headache pain begins. In the 15% of migraine patients whose headache
is preceded by an aura, the aura itself allows diagnosis. The headache in migraines with or without auras is similar.
Women are threefold more likely than are men to experience either type of migraine.
1418
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1419 ---

B.  Biologic basis of migraine headaches
The first manifestation of migraine with aura is a spreading depression of neuronal activity accompanied by reduced
blood flow in the most posterior part of the cerebral hemisphere. This hypoperfusion gradually spreads forward over
the surface of the cortex to other contiguous areas of the brain. The vascular alteration is accompanied by functional
changes. The hypoperfusion persists throughout the aura and well into the headache phase. Patients who have
migraine without aura do not show hypoperfusion. However, the pain of both types of migraine may be due to
extracranial and intracranial arterial vasodilation, which leads to release of neuroactive molecules, such as substance
P, neurokinin A, and calcitonin gene–related peptide.
1419
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1420 ---

C.  Symptomatic treatment of acute migraine
Acute treatments can be classified as nonspecific (symptomatic) or migraine specific. Nonspecific treatment
includes analgesics such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antiemetics (for example,
prochlorperazine) to control vomiting. Opioids are reserved as rescue medication when other treatments for a severe
migraine are not successful. Migraine-specific therapy includes triptans and ergot alkaloids, which are 5-HT1B/1D
receptor and 5-HT1D receptor agonists, respectively. It has been proposed that activation of 5-HT1 receptors by these
agents leads either to vasoconstriction or to inhibition of the release of proinflammatory neuropeptides on the
trigeminal nerve innervating cranial blood vessels.
1.  Triptans
This class of drugs includes almotriptan [al-moe-TRIP-tan], eletriptan [el-e-TRIP-tan], frovatriptan [froe-va-TRIP-
tan], naratriptan [nar-a-TRIP-tan], rizatriptan [rye-za-TRIP-tan], sumatriptan [soo-ma-TRIP-tan], and zolmitriptan
[zole-ma-TRIP-tan]. Sumatriptan was the first available triptan, and is the prototype of this class. These agents
rapidly and effectively abort or markedly reduce the severity of migraine headaches in about 70% of patients. The
triptans are serotonin agonists, acting at a subgroup of serotonin receptors found on small peripheral nerves that
innervate the intracranial vasculature. The nausea that occurs with dihydroergotamine and the vasoconstriction
caused by ergotamine (see below) are much less pronounced with the triptans. Sumatriptan is given subcutaneously,
intranasally, or orally (sumatriptan is also available in a combination product with naproxen). Zolmitriptan is
available orally and by nasal spray. All other agents are taken orally. The onset of the parenteral drug sumatriptan is
about 20 minutes, compared with 1 to 2 hours when the drug is administered orally. The drug has a short duration of
action, with an elimination half-life of 2 hours. Headache commonly recurs within 24 to 48 hours after a single dose
of drug, but in most patients, a second dose is effective in aborting the headache. Frovatriptan is the longest-acting
triptan, with a half-life of more than 24 hours. Individual response to triptans varies, and a trial of more than one
triptan may be necessary before treatment is successful. Elevation of blood pressure and other cardiac events have
been reported with triptan use. Therefore, triptans should not be administered to patients with risk factors for
coronary artery disease without performing a cardiac evaluation prior to administration. Other adverse events with
the use of triptans include pain and pressure sensations in the chest, neck, throat, and jaw. Dizziness and malaise
have also been seen with the use of triptans.
2.  Ergot alkaloids
Ergotamine [er-GOT-a-meen] and dihydroergotamine [dye-hye-droe-er-GOT-a-meen], a semisynthetic derivative of
ergotamine, are ergot alkaloids approved for the treatment of migraine headaches. The action of the ergot alkaloids
is complex, with ability to bind to 5-HT1 receptors, α receptors, and dopamine receptors. 5-HT1 receptors located on
intracranial blood vessels are targets that cause vasoconstriction with the use of these agents. Ergotamine is
currently available sublingually and is mostly effective when used in the early stages of the migraine. It is also
available as an oral tablet or suppository containing both ergotamine and caffeine. Ergotamine is used with strict
daily and weekly dosage limits due to its ability to cause dependence and rebound headaches. Dihydroergotamine is
administered intravenously or intranasally and has an efficacy similar to that of sumatriptan. The use of
dihydroergotamine is limited to severe cases of migraines. Nausea is a common adverse effect. Ergotamine and
dihydroergotamine are contraindicated in patients with angina and peripheral vascular disease because they are
significant vasoconstrictors.
3.  Nonspecific therapies
Other therapies for acute migraine attacks include analgesics, antiemetics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and
corticosteroids.

--- PAGE 1421 ---

D.  Prophylaxis for migraine headache
Therapy to prevent migraine is indicated if the attacks occur two or more times a month and if the headaches are
severe or complicated by serious neurologic signs. β-Blockers are the drugs of choice for migraine prophylaxis;
however, calcium channel blockers, anticonvulsants (topiramate and divalproex), and tricyclic antidepressants have
also shown effectiveness in migraine prevention (Figure 37.10).
Figure 37.10 Drugs useful in the treatment and prophylaxis of migraine headaches.

--- PAGE 1422 ---

E.  Drugs for tension and cluster headache
Analgesics (NSAIDS, acetaminophen, aspirin) are used for symptom relief of tension headaches, and caffeine and
butalbital  are often combined with acetaminophen or aspirin. Triptans, along with inhalation of 100% oxygen, are
used as first-line abortive strategies for cluster headache.

VII.  Drugs for Obesity
The term “obesity” is given to individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or greater. Obesity is due in
part to an energy imbalance; however, it is now well understood that genetics, metabolism, behavior, environment,
culture, and socioeconomic status play a role in obesity, as well. Serotonin agonists have been used in the treatment
of obesity for the appetite suppression that they produce. Drugs for obesity are considered effective if they
demonstrate at least a 5% greater reduction in body weight as compared to placebo (no treatment). The majority of
drugs approved to treat obesity have short-term indications for usage. A summary of medications for obesity is
provided in Figure 37.11.
Figure 37.11 Summary of drugs used in the treatment of obesity.

A.  Serotonin agonists
The first serotonin agonists used for weight loss, fenfluramine and dexflenfluramine, were withdrawn from the
market following an increase in potentially fatal adverse effects, including valvulopathy. Valvulopathy, which may
lead to pulmonary hypertension, is linked to 5-HT2B receptors. Lorcaserin [lor-KAS-er-in] is a serotonin agonist
with selectivity for the 5-HT2C serotonin receptor. In contrast to many other weight loss drugs, it is used for chronic
weight management.
1.  Mechanism of action
Lorcaserin selectively activates 5-HT2C receptors, which are almost exclusively found in the central nervous system.
This activation, in turn, stimulates proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons, which activate melanocortin receptors,
thereby causing a decrease in appetite (Figure 37.12). If a patient does not lose at least 5% of his or her body weight
after 12 weeks of use, the drug should be discontinued.
Figure 37.12 Lorcaserin mechanism of action. POMC = proopiomelanocortin.
2.  Pharmacokinetics
Lorcaserin is extensively metabolized in the liver to two inactive metabolites that are then eliminated in the urine.
Lorcaserin has not been studied for use in severe hepatic impairment and is not recommended in severe renal
impairment.
3.  Adverse effects
The most common adverse effects observed with lorcaserin are nausea, headache, dry mouth, dizziness,
constipation, and lethargy. Although rare, mood changes and suicidal ideation can occur. The development of life-
threatening serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome has been reported with the use of serotonin
agonists. Therefore, patients should be monitored for the emergence of these conditions while on lorcaserin.
Because of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, concomitant use of lorcaserin with selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, MAOIs, or other serotonergic drugs should be
avoided. As mentioned above, valvulopathy has been associated with the use of 5-HT2B receptor agonists. Although
the incidence of valvulopathy was not significantly increased in studies of lorcaserin, a 5-HT2C receptor agonist,
patients should still be monitored for the development of this condition. For that reason, individuals with a history of
heart failure should use this agent with caution.
1424
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1425 ---

B.  Other agents for obesity
In addition to lorcaserin, several agents with varying mechanisms of action are available for weight loss and the
management of obesity.
1.  Appetite suppressants
Phentermine [FEN-ter-meen] and diethylpropion [dye-eth-ill-PROE-pee-on] are appetite suppressants. They exert
pharmacologic action by increasing the release of norepinephrine and dopamine from the nerve terminals and by
inhibiting reuptake of these neurotransmitters, thereby increasing levels of neurotransmitters in the brain. The
increase in norepinephrine signals a “fight-or-flight” response by the body, which, in turn, decreases appetite.
Tolerance to the weight loss effect of these agents develops within weeks, and weight loss typically plateaus. An
increase in the dosage generally does not result in further weight loss, and discontinuation of the drug is usually
recommended once the plateau is reached. The anorexiants are classified as controlled substances due to the
potential for dependence or abuse. Dry mouth, headache, insomnia, and constipation are common adverse effects.
Heart rate and blood pressure may be increased with these agents. Therefore, these drugs should be avoided in
patients with a history of uncontrolled hypertension, cardiovascular disease, arrhythmias, heart failure, or stroke.
Concomitant use of anorexiants with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or other sympathomimetics should be
avoided.
2.  Lipase inhibitor
Orlistat  [OR-lih-stat] is the only agent in a class of antiobesity drugs known as lipase inhibitors. It is indicated for
weight loss or weight maintenance. Orlistat  is a pentanoic acid ester that inhibits gastric and pancreatic lipases, thus
decreasing the breakdown of dietary fat into smaller molecules that can be absorbed. Administration of orlistat
decreases fat absorption by about 30%. The loss of calories from decreased absorption of fat is the main cause of
weight loss. Figure 37.13 shows the effects of orlistat  treatment. The clinical utility of orlistat  is limited by
gastrointestinal adverse effects, including oily spotting, flatulence with discharge, fecal urgency, and increased
defecation. These effects may be minimized through a low-fat diet and the use of concomitant cholestyramine.
Orlistat  is contraindicated in pregnancy and in patients with chronic malabsorption syndrome or cholestasis. The
drug also interferes with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and β-carotene. Patients should be advised to take a
multivitamin supplement that contains vitamins A, D, E, and K and β-carotene. Orlistat  can also interfere with the
absorption of other medications, such as amiodarone, cyclosporine, and levothyroxine, and clinical response to these
medications should be monitored if orlistat  is initiated. The dose of levothyroxine should be separated from orlistat
by at least 4 hours.

3.  Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist
Liraglutide is an injectable GLP-1 receptor agonist that is indicated for obesity. See Chapter 24 for a full discussion
of GLP-1 receptor agonists.
4.  Combination therapy
The combination of phentermine and topiramate has been approved for long-term use in the treatment of obesity.
Initial studies of the anticonvulsant topiramate observed weight loss in patients taking the medication. Because of
the sedating effects of topiramate, the stimulant phentermine was added to counteract sedation and promote
additional weight loss. If a patient does not achieve a 5% weight loss after 12 weeks on the highest dose of this
medication, then it should be discontinued. It is also important to note that this medication should not be stopped
abruptly as seizures may be precipitated. Topiramate has been associated with birth defects including cleft palate,
and, thus, the combination of phentermine/ topiramate is contraindicated in pregnancy. Bupropion and naltrexone is

another combination therapy approved for chronic weight management. Important characteristics of the medications
for obesity are summarized in Figure 37.14.

Choose the ONE best answer.
A 43-year-old heavy machine operator complains of seasonal allergies. Which medication is most
appropriate for management of his allergy symptoms?
A.  Diphenhydramine
B.  Doxylamine
C.  Hydroxyzine
D.  Fexofenadine
Correct answer = D. The use of first-generation H1 antihistamines is contraindicated in the treatment of pilots and
others who must remain alert. Because of its lower potential to induce drowsiness, fexofenadine may be
recommended for individuals working in jobs in which wakefulness is critical.
Which statement concerning H1 antihistamines is correct?
A.  Second-generation H1 antihistamines are relatively free of adverse effects.
B.  Because of the established long-term safety of first-generation H1 antihistamines, they are the first choice for
allergic rhinitis.
C.  The motor coordination involved in driving an automobile is not affected by the use of first-generation H1
antihistamines.
D.  H1 antihistamines can be used in the treatment of acute anaphylaxis.
Correct answer = A. Second-generation H1 antihistamines are preferred over first-generation agents because they
are relatively free of adverse effects. Driving performance is adversely affected by first-generation H1
antihistamines. Epinephrine, not antihistamine, is an acceptable treatment for acute anaphylaxis. Second-
generation H1 antihistamines penetrate the blood–brain barrier to a lesser degree than do the first-generation
drugs.
Which histamine receptor antagonist is known to enter the central nervous system readily and cause
sedation?
A.  Hydroxyzine
B.  Cetirizine
C.  Desloratadine
D.  Loratadine
Correct answer = A. Choices B, C, and D are all second-generation antihistamines that cross the blood–brain
barrier to a much lesser extent than does hydroxyzine. Hydroxyzine is the only drug that crosses the blood–brain
barrier easily.
Which drug is an H1-receptor antagonist that also has serotonin receptor antagonism on the appetite center,
with the ability to stimulate appetite?
A.  Hydroxyzine
B.  Loratadine
C.  Diphenhydramine
D.  Cyproheptadine
Correct answer = D. Cyproheptadine has significant serotonin antagonism and is known to increase appetite.
Which drug for headache is contraindicated in patients with peripheral vascular disease?
A.  Ergotamine
B.  Aspirin
C.  Acetaminophen
D.  Naproxen
Correct answer = A. Ergotamine is contraindicated in peripheral vascular disease because it is a significant
vasoconstrictor.
A 29-year-old woman complains of migraine headaches associated with early onset vomiting. Currently, she
uses ibuprofen as needed for her migraines, but it is not very effective. Which triptan would be ideal for this
patient?
A.  Naratriptan
B.  Zolmitriptan
C.  Frovatriptan
D.  Almotriptan1427
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1428 ---

37.7
37.8
37.9
37.10Correct answer = B. Although all of the triptans listed are available as an oral tablet, this patient suffers from
vomiting associated with her migraines. Zolmitriptan and sumatriptan are available as an intranasal dosage form,
which would be ideal for this patient.
A 35-year-old woman is having several severe migraines per month. The migraines are usually relieved with
one or two doses of triptan drugs. Which is most appropriate for prophylaxis to reduce the frequency of her
migraines?
A.  Dihydroergotamine
B.  Ibuprofen
C.  Propranolol
D.  Sumatriptan
Correct answer = C. β-Blockers such as propranolol are used for prophylaxis to reduce the frequency of
migraines. The other medications are all used to treat an acute migraine headache.
A 27-year-old married woman is asking about treatment options for obesity. She recently stopped taking her
birth control medications, as she felt they were contributing to her weight gain. Which medication should be
avoided in this patient?
A.  Phentermine/topiramate
B.  Orlistat
C.  Diethylpropion
D.  Lorcaserin
Correct answer = A. Although patients should not take any medications to lose weight during pregnancy, the
topiramate component of this medication is especially dangerous, since it can be teratogenic. Because this patient
stopped her birth control medicine, she is at risk of becoming pregnant and developing birth defects while also on
this medication.
A fellow health care provider is concerned about prescribing orlistat to adolescent patients. Many of his
adolescent patients are stopping the medication during the first month of treatment. Which side effect is the
most likely reason the adolescents are stopping orlistat?
A.  Valvulopathy
B.  Suicidal ideation
C.  Drowsiness
D.  Flatulence
Correct answer = D. Flatulence is a very common side effect with orlistat, along with several other GI
disturbances. For adolescents, these side effects may be embarrassing and difficult to manage. It is important to
counsel patients about these gastrointestinal side effects with orlistat and recommend a low-fat diet as well as
cholestyramine to counteract the effects should they become bothersome. The other side effects listed have been
seen with other obesity medications, but not with orlistat.
A 38-year-old obese man with depression is considering a weight loss medication following several failed
attempts with diet and exercise. Which medication could be considered in this individual?
A.  Liraglutide
B.  Bupropion + naltrexone
C.  Orlistat
D.  Lorcaserin
Correct answer = C. Only orlistat has not been associated with suicidal ideation. All of the other drugs listed may
cause suicidal ideation and would not be advisable for an individual with depression. Also, with a history of
depression, the patient may be taking a medication that could increase serotonin levels. The addition of lorcaserin,
a serotonin receptor agonist, could lead to serotonin syndrome further excluding it from the list of possible
options.1428

I.  Overview
Inflammation is a normal, protective response to tissue injury caused by physical trauma, noxious chemicals, or
microbiologic agents. Inflammation is the body’s effort to inactivate or destroy invading organisms, remove
irritants, and set the stage for tissue repair. When healing is complete, the inflammatory process usually subsides.
However, inappropriate activation of the immune system can result in inflammation and immune-mediated diseases
such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Normally, the immune system can differentiate between self and nonself. In RA,
white blood cells (WBCs) view the synovium as nonself and initiate an inflammatory attack. WBC activation leads
to stimulation of T lymphocytes, which recruit and activate monocytes and macrophages. These cells secrete
proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1, into the synovial cavity,
ultimately leading to joint destruction and other systemic abnormalities characteristic of RA. In addition to T
lymphocyte activation, B lymphocytes are also involved and produce rheumatoid factor and other autoantibodies to
maintain inflammation. These defensive reactions cause progressive tissue injury, resulting in joint damage and
erosions, functional disability, pain, and reduced quality of life. Pharmacotherapy for RA includes anti-inflammatory
and/or immunosuppressive agents that modulate/reduce the inflammatory process, with the goals of reducing
inflammation and pain, and halting or slowing disease progression. The agents discussed in this chapter ( Figure
38.1) include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), celecoxib, acetaminophen, and disease-modifying
antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Additionally, agents used for the treatment of gout are reviewed.

II.  Prostaglandins
NSAIDs act through inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins. Thus, an understanding of NSAIDs requires
comprehension of the actions and biosynthesis of prostaglandins—unsaturated fatty acid derivatives containing 20
carbons that include a cyclic ring structure. [Note: These compounds are sometimes referred to as eicosanoids;
“eicosa” refers to the 20 carbon atoms.]
1433
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1434 ---

A.  Role of prostaglandins as local mediators
Prostaglandins and related compounds are produced in minute quantities by virtually all tissues. They generally act
locally on the tissues in which they are synthesized and are rapidly metabolized to inactive products at their sites of
action. Therefore, prostaglandins do not circulate in the blood in significant concentrations. Thromboxanes and
leukotrienes are related compounds that are synthesized from the same precursors as the prostaglandins.
1434
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1435 ---

B.  Synthesis of prostaglandins
Arachidonic acid is the primary precursor of the prostaglandins and related compounds, and it is present as a
component of the phospholipids of cell membranes. Free arachidonic acid is released from tissue phospholipids by
the action of phospholipase A2 via a process controlled by hormones and other stimuli. There are two major
pathways in the synthesis of eicosanoids from arachidonic acid, the cyclooxygenase and the lipoxygenase pathways.
1435
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1436 ---

Cyclooxygenase pathway
Eicosanoids with ring structures (that is, prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and prostacyclins) are synthesized via the
cyclooxygenase pathway. Two related isoforms of the cyclooxygenase enzymes exist. Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1)
is responsible for the physiologic production of prostanoids, whereas cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) causes the
elevated production of prostanoids that occurs in sites of chronic disease and inflammation. COX-1 is a constitutive
enzyme that regulates normal cellular processes, such as gastric cytoprotection, vascular homeostasis, platelet
aggregation, and reproductive and kidney functions. COX-2 is constitutively expressed in tissues such as the brain,
kidney, and bone. Its expression at other sites is increased during states of chronic inflammation. Differences in
binding site shape have permitted the development of selective COX-2 inhibitors ( Figure 38.2). Additionally,
expression of COX-2 is induced by inflammatory mediators like TNF-α and IL-1 but can also be pharmacologically
inhibited by glucocorticoids (Figure 38.3), which may contribute to the significant anti-inflammatory effects of these
drugs.

2.

2.  Lipoxygenase pathway
Alternatively, several lipoxygenases can act on arachidonic acid to form leukotrienes (Figure 38.3). Antileukotriene
drugs, such as zileuton, zafirlukast , and montelukast , are treatment options for asthma (see Chapter 39).
1438

--- PAGE 1439 ---

C.  Actions of prostaglandins
Actions of prostaglandins are mediated by their binding to a variety of distinct G-coupled protein receptors in cell
membranes. Prostaglandins and their metabolites act as local signals that fine-tune the response of a specific cell
type. Their functions vary depending on the tissue and the specific enzymes within the pathway that are available at
that particular site. For example, the release of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) from platelets during tissue injury triggers
the recruitment of new platelets for aggregation and local vasoconstriction. However, prostacyclin (PGI2), produced
by endothelial cells, has opposite effects, inhibiting platelet aggregation and producing vasodilation. The net effect
on platelets and blood vessels depends on the balance of these two prostanoids.

--- PAGE 1440 ---

D.  Therapeutic uses of prostaglandins
Prostaglandins have a major role in modulating pain, inflammation, and fever. They control many physiological
functions, such as acid secretion and mucus production in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, uterine contractions, and
renal blood flow. Prostaglandins are among the chemical mediators released in allergic and inflammatory processes.
Therefore, they find use for the disorders discussed below (Figure 38.4).

E.  Alprostadil
Alprostadil  [al-PROS-ta-dil] is a PGE1 analog that is naturally produced in tissues such as seminal vesicles and
cavernous tissues, in the placenta, and in the ductus arteriosus of the fetus. PGE1 maintains the patency of the ductus
arteriosus during pregnancy. The ductus closes soon after delivery to allow normal blood circulation between the
lungs and the heart. In neonates with congenital heart conditions, infusion of alprostadil  keeps the ductus open,
allowing time until surgical correction is possible. Alprostadil  is also used for erectile dysfunction (see Chapter 41).

F.  Lubiprostone
Lubiprostone [loo-bee-PROS-tone] is a PGE1 derivative indicated for the treatment of chronic idiopathic
constipation, opioid-induced constipation, and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. It stimulates chloride
channels in the luminal cells of the intestinal epithelium, thereby increasing intestinal fluid secretion (see Chapter
40). Nausea and diarrhea are the most common adverse effects of lubiprostone (Figure 38.5). Nausea can be
decreased if taken with food.

--- PAGE 1443 ---

G.  Misoprostol
Misoprostol  [mye-soe-PROST-ole], a PGE1 analog, is used to protect the mucosal lining of the stomach during
chronic NSAID treatment. Misoprostol  interacts with prostaglandin receptors on parietal cells within the stomach,
reducing gastric acid secretion. Furthermore, misoprostol  has a GI cytoprotective effect by stimulating mucus and
bicarbonate production. This combination of effects decreases the incidence of NSAID-induced gastric ulcers.
[Note: There is a combination product containing the NSAID diclofenac and misoprostol .] Misoprostol  is also used
off-label in obstetric settings for labor induction, since it increases uterine contractions by interacting with
prostaglandin receptors in the uterus. Misoprostol  has the potential to induce abortion. Therefore, the drug is
contraindicated during pregnancy. Its use is limited by common adverse effects including diarrhea and abdominal
pain.

H.  Prostaglandin F 2α analogs
Bimatoprost  [bih-MAT-oh-prost], latanoprost  [la-TAN-oh-prost], tafluprost  [TAF-loo-prost], and travoprost
[TRAV-oh-prost] are PGF2α analogs that are indicated for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma. By binding to
prostaglandin receptors, they increase uveoscleral outflow, reducing intraocular pressure. They are administered as
ophthalmic solutions once a day and are as effective as timolol  or better in reducing intraocular pressure.
Bimatoprost  increases eyelash prominence, length, and darkness and is approved for the treatment of eyelash
hypotrichosis. Ocular reactions include blurred vision, iris color change (increased brown pigmentation), increased
number and pigment of eyelashes, ocular irritation, and foreign body sensation.

I.  Prostacyclin (PGI 2) analogs
Epoprostenol  [ee-poe-PROST-en-ol], the pharmaceutical form of naturally occurring prostacyclin, and the synthetic
analogs of prostacyclin (iloprost  [EYE-loe-prost] and treprostinil  [tre-PROS-ti-nil]) are potent pulmonary
vasodilators that are used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. These drugs mimic the effects of
prostacyclin in endothelial cells, producing a significant reduction in pulmonary arterial resistance with a subsequent
increase in cardiac index and oxygen delivery. These agents have short half-lives. Epoprostenol  and treprostinil  are
administered as a continuous intravenous infusion, and treprostinil  is administered orally or via inhalation or
subcutaneous infusion. Inhaled iloprost  requires frequent dosing due to the short half-life (Figure 38.6). Dizziness,
headache, flushing, and fainting are the most common adverse effects (Figure 38.7). Bronchospasm and cough can
also occur after inhalation of iloprost .

III.  Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs
NSAIDs are a group of chemically dissimilar agents that differ in their antipyretic, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory
activities. The class includes derivatives of salicylic acid (aspirin [AS-pir-in], diflunisal  [dye-FLOO-ni-sal],
salsalate [SAL-sa-late]), propionic acid (ibuprofen [eye-bue-PROE-fen], fenoprofen [fen-oh-PROE-fen],
flurbiprofen [flure-BI-proe-fen], ketoprofen [kee-toe-PROE-fen], naproxen [na-PROX-en], oxaprozin [ox-a-PROE-
zin]), acetic acid (diclofenac [dye-KLOE-fen-ak], etodolac [ee-toe-DOE-lak], indomethacin [in-doe-METH-a-sin],
ketorolac [kee-toe-ROLE-ak], nabumetone [na-BUE-me-tone], sulindac [sul-IN-dak], tolmetin [TOLE-met-in]),
enolic acid (meloxicam [mel-OKS-i-kam], piroxicam [peer-OX-i-kam]), fenamates (mefenamic [me-fe-NAM-ik]
acid, meclofenamate [me-kloe-fen-AM-ate]), and the selective COX-2 inhibitor ( celecoxib [sel-e-KOX-ib]). They
act primarily by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzymes that catalyze the first step in prostanoid biosynthesis. This
leads to decreased prostaglandin synthesis with both beneficial and unwanted effects. [Note: Differences in safety
and efficacy of the NSAIDs may be explained by relative selectivity for the COX-1 or COX-2 enzyme. Inhibition of
COX-2 is thought to lead to the anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions of NSAIDs, whereas inhibition of COX-1 is
responsible for prevention of cardiovascular events and most adverse events.]
1447
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1448 ---

A.  Aspirin and other NSAIDs
Aspirin can be thought of as a traditional NSAID, but it exhibits anti-inflammatory activity only at relatively high
doses that are rarely used. It is used more frequently at lower doses to prevent cardiovascular events such as stroke
and myocardial infarction (MI). Aspirin is often differentiated from other NSAIDs since it is an irreversible inhibitor
of cyclooxygenase activity.
1448
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1449 ---

1.  Mechanism of action
Aspirin is a weak organic acid that irreversibly acetylates and, thus, inactivates cyclooxygenase (Figure 38.8). The
other NSAIDs are reversible inhibitors of cyclooxygenase. The NSAIDs, including aspirin, have three major
therapeutic actions: they reduce inflammation (anti-inflammatory), pain (analgesic effect), and fever (antipyretic
effect; Figure 38.9). However, not all NSAIDs are equally effective in each of these actions.
Figure 38.8 Metabolism of aspirin and acetylation of cyclooxygenase by aspirin.
1449
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1450 ---

Figure 38.9 Actions of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and
acetaminophen.
a.  Anti-inflammatory actions
Inhibition of cyclooxygenase diminishes the formation of prostaglandins and, thus, modulates aspects of
inflammation mediated by prostaglandins. NSAIDs inhibit inflammation in arthritis, but they neither arrest the
progression of the disease nor induce remission.
b.  Analgesic action
PGE2 is thought to sensitize nerve endings to the action of bradykinin, histamine, and other chemical mediators
released locally by the inflammatory process. Thus, by decreasing PGE2 synthesis, the sensation of pain can be
decreased. As COX-2 is expressed during times of inflammation and injury, it is thought that inhibition of this
enzyme is responsible for the analgesic activity of NSAIDs. No single NSAID has demonstrated superior efficacy
over another, and they are generally considered to have equivalent analgesic efficacy. The NSAIDs are used mainly
for the management of mild to moderate pain arising from musculoskeletal disorders. One exception is ketorolac,
which can be used for more severe pain, but for only a short duration.
c.  Antipyretic action
Fever occurs when the set-point of the anterior hypothalamic thermoregulatory center is elevated. This can be
caused by PGE2 synthesis, which is stimulated when endogenous fever-producing agents (pyrogens), such as
cytokines, are released from WBCs that are activated by infection, hypersensitivity, malignancy, or inflammation.
The NSAIDs lower body temperature in patients with fever by impeding PGE2 synthesis and release, resetting the
“thermostat” back toward normal. This rapidly lowers the body temperature of febrile patients by increasing heat
dissipation through peripheral vasodilation and sweating. NSAIDs have no effect on normal body temperature.
2.  Therapeutic uses1450
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1451 ---

a.  Anti-inflammatory and analgesic uses
NSAIDs are used in the treatment of osteoarthritis, gout, RA, and common conditions requiring analgesia (for
example, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, and dysmenorrhea). Combinations of opioids and NSAIDs may be effective
in treating pain caused by malignancy. Furthermore, the addition of NSAIDs may lead to an opioid-sparing effect,
allowing for lower doses of opioids to be utilized. The salicylates exhibit analgesic activity at lower doses. Only at
higher doses do these drugs show anti-inflammatory activity (Figure 38.10). For example, two 325-mg aspirin
tablets administered four times daily produce analgesia, whereas 12 to 20 tablets per day produce both analgesic and
anti-inflammatory activity.
1451
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1452 ---

Figure 38.10 Dose-dependent effects of salicylate.
b.  Antipyretic uses
Aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen may be used to treat fever. [Note: Aspirin should be avoided in patients less than
19 years old with viral infections, such as varicella (chickenpox) or influenza, to prevent Reye syndrome—a

--- PAGE 1453 ---

syndrome that can cause fulminating hepatitis with cerebral edema, often leading to death.]
c.  Cardiovascular applications
Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1–mediated production of TXA2, thereby reducing TXA2-mediated
vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation and the subsequent risk of cardiovascular events (Figure 38.11). The
antiplatelet effects persist for the life of the platelet. Low doses of aspirin (75 to 162 mg—commonly 81 mg) are
used prophylactically to reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events, transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), stroke,
and death in patients with a history of previous MI, TIA, or stroke. Chronic use of aspirin allows for continued
inhibition as new platelets are generated. Aspirin is also used acutely to reduce the risk of death in acute MI and in
patients undergoing certain revascularization procedures.
Figure 38.11 Aspirin irreversibly inhibits platelet cyclooxygenase-1.
d.  External applications
Salicylic acid is used topically to treat acne, corns, calluses, and warts. Methyl salicylate (“oil of wintergreen”) is
used externally as a cutaneous counterirritant in liniments, such as arthritis creams and sports rubs. Diclofenac is
available in topical formulations (gel or solution) for treatment of osteoarthritis in the knees or hands. In addition,
ocular formulations of ketorolac are approved for management of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis and inflammation
and pain related to ocular surgery.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
a.  Aspirin
After oral administration, aspirin is rapidly deacetylated by esterases in the body to produce salicylate. Unionized
salicylates are passively absorbed mainly from the upper small intestine. Salicylates (except for diflunisal ) cross
both the blood–brain barrier and the placenta and are absorbed through intact skin (especially methyl salicylate).
Salicylate is converted by the liver to water-soluble conjugates that are rapidly cleared by the kidney, resulting in
first-order elimination and a serum half-life of 3.5 hours. At anti-inflammatory dosages of aspirin (more than 4
g/day), the hepatic metabolic pathway becomes saturated, and zero-order kinetics are observed, leading to a half-life
of 15 hours or more (Figure 38.12). Salicylate is secreted into the urine and can affect uric acid excretion. Therefore,
aspirin should be avoided in gout, if possible, or in patients taking probenecid.
1453
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1454 ---

Figure 38.12 Effect of dose on the half-life of aspirin.
b.  Other NSAIDs
Most NSAIDs are well absorbed after oral administration and circulate highly bound to plasma proteins. The
majority are metabolized by the liver, mostly to inactivate metabolites. Few (for example, nabumetone and sulindac)
have active metabolites. Excretion of active drug and metabolites is primarily via the urine.
4.  Adverse events
Because of the adverse event profile, it is preferable to use NSAIDs at the lowest effective dose for the shortest
duration possible.
a.  Gastrointestinal
These are the most common adverse effects of NSAIDs, ranging from dyspepsia to bleeding. Normally, production
of prostacyclin (PGI2) inhibits gastric acid secretion, and PGE2 and PGF2α stimulate synthesis of protective mucus
in both the stomach and small intestine. Agents that inhibit COX-1 reduce beneficial levels of these prostaglandins,
resulting in increased gastric acid secretion, diminished mucus protection, and increased risk for GI bleeding and
ulceration. Agents with a higher relative selectivity for COX-1 may have a higher risk for GI events compared to
those with a lower relative selectivity for COX-1 (that is, higher COX-2 selectivity). NSAIDs should be taken with
food or fluids to diminish GI upset. If NSAIDs are used in patients at high risk for GI events, proton pump inhibitors
or misoprostol  should be used concomitantly to prevent NSAID-induced ulcers (see Chapter 40).
b.  Increased risk of bleeding (antiplatelet effect)
As described above, aspirin inhibits COX-1–mediated formation of TXA2 and reduces platelet aggregation for the
lifetime of the platelet (3 to 7 days). Platelet aggregation is the first step in thrombus formation, and the antiplatelet
effect of aspirin results in a prolonged bleeding time. For this reason, aspirin is often withheld for at least 1 week
prior to surgery. NSAIDs other than aspirin are not utilized for their antiplatelet effect but can still prolong bleeding
time, especially when combined with anticoagulants. Concomitant use of NSAIDs and aspirin can prevent aspirin
from binding to cyclooxygenase. Patients who take aspirin for cardioprotection should avoid concomitant NSAID
use if possible or take aspirin at least 30 minutes prior to the NSAID.
c.  Renal effects
NSAIDs prevent the synthesis of PGE2 and PGI2, prostaglandins that are responsible for maintaining renal blood
flow (Figure 38.13). Decreased synthesis of prostaglandins can result in retention of sodium and water and may
cause edema. Patients with a history of heart failure or kidney disease are at particularly high risk. These effects can
also mitigate the beneficial effects of antihypertensive medications. In susceptible patients, NSAIDs have led to1454

acute kidney injury.
Figure 38.13 Renal effect of NSAID inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. NSAIDs =
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
d.  Cardiac effects
Agents such as aspirin, with a very high degree of COX-1 selectivity at low doses, have a cardiovascular protective
effect thought to be due to a reduction in the production of TXA2. Agents with higher relative COX-2 selectivity
have been associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events, possibly by decreasing PGI2 production
mediated by COX-2. An increased risk for cardiovascular events, including MI and stroke, has been associated with
all NSAIDs except aspirin. All NSAIDs carry a boxed warning regarding the increased risk for cardiovascular
events. Use of NSAIDs, other than aspirin, is discouraged in patients with established cardiovascular disease. For
patients with cardiovascular disease in whom NSAID treatment cannot be avoided, naproxen may be the least likely
to be harmful.
Other adverse effects
NSAIDs are inhibitors of cyclooxygenases and, therefore, inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins but not of
leukotrienes. For this reason, NSAIDs should be used with caution in patients with asthma, as inhibition of
prostaglandin synthesis can cause a shift toward leukotriene production and increase the risk of asthma
exacerbations. Central nervous system (CNS) adverse events, such as headache, tinnitus, and dizziness, may occur.
Approximately 15% of patients taking aspirin experience hypersensitivity reactions. Symptoms of true allergy
include urticaria, bronchoconstriction, and angioedema. Patients with severe hypersensitivity to aspirin should avoid
using NSAIDs.
f.  Drug interactions
Salicylate is roughly 80% to 90% plasma protein bound (albumin) and can be displaced from protein-binding sites,
resulting in increased concentration of free salicylate. Alternatively, aspirin can displace other highly protein-bound
drugs, such as warfarin, phenytoin, or valproic acid, resulting in higher free concentrations of these agents (Figure
38.14).

Figure 38.14 Drugs interacting with salicylates.
g.  Toxicity
Mild salicylate toxicity is called salicylism and is characterized by nausea, vomiting, marked hyperventilation,
headache, mental confusion, dizziness, and tinnitus (ringing or roaring in the ears). When large doses of salicylate
are administered, severe salicylate intoxication may result (see Figure 38.10). Restlessness, delirium, hallucinations,
convulsions, coma, respiratory and metabolic acidosis, and death from respiratory failure may occur. Children are
particularly prone to salicylate intoxication; ingestion of as little as 10 g of aspirin can be fatal.
h.  Pregnancy
NSAIDs should be used in pregnancy only if benefits outweigh risks to the developing fetus. [Note: Acetaminophen
is preferred if analgesic or antipyretic effects are needed during pregnancy.] In the third trimester, NSAIDs should
generally be avoided due to the risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.

B.  Celecoxib
Celecoxib [SEL-e-KOX-ib], a selective COX-2 inhibitor, is significantly more selective for inhibition of COX-2
than COX-1 (Figure 38.15). Unlike the inhibition of COX-1 by aspirin (which is irreversible), the inhibition of
COX-2 is reversible.

logarithm of their ratio of IC80 (drug concentration to achieve 80% inhibition of
cyclooxygenase). *Aspirin graphed for IC50 value due to it showing significantly more
COX-1 selectivity at lower doses and graph using higher concentrations does not

--- PAGE 1459 ---

accurately reflect the usage or selectivity of aspirin.
1.  Therapeutic uses
Celecoxib is approved for the treatment of RA, osteoarthritis, and acute pain. Celecoxib has similar efficacy to
NSAIDs in the treatment of pain.
2.  Pharmacokinetics
Celecoxib is readily absorbed after oral administration. It is extensively metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450
(CYP2C9), and the metabolites are excreted in feces and urine. The half-life is about 11 hours, and the drug may be
dosed once or twice daily. The dosage should be reduced in those with moderate hepatic impairment, and celecoxib
should be avoided in patients with severe hepatic or renal disease.
3.  Adverse effects
Headache, dyspepsia, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are the most common adverse effects. Celecoxib is associated
with less GI bleeding and dyspepsia than other NSAIDs. However, this benefit is lost when aspirin is added to
celecoxib therapy. Patients who are at high risk of ulcers and require aspirin for cardiovascular prevention should
avoid the use of celecoxib. Like other NSAIDs, celecoxib has a similar risk for cardiovascular events. Patients who
have had anaphylactoid reactions to aspirin or nonselective NSAIDs may be at risk for similar effects with
celecoxib. Inhibitors of CYP2C9, such as fluconazole, may increase serum levels of celecoxib.
Figure 38.16 summarizes some of the therapeutic advantages and disadvantages of members of the NSAID
family.

group, with the exception of aspirin, these drugs may have the potential to increase risk
of myocardial infarction and stroke. GI = gastrointestinal; CNS = central nervous system;

IV.  Acetaminophen
Acetaminophen [a-SEET-a-MIN-oh-fen] (N -acetyl-p-aminophenol or APAP) inhibits prostaglandin synthesis in the
CNS, leading to antipyretic and analgesic effects. Acetaminophen has less effect on cyclooxygenase in peripheral
tissues (due to peripheral inactivation), which accounts for its weak anti-inflammatory activity. Acetaminophen does
not affect platelet function or increase bleeding time. It is not considered an NSAID.
1460
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1461 ---

A.  Therapeutic uses
Acetaminophen is used for the treatment of fever and the relief of pain. It is useful in patients with gastric
complaints/risks with NSAIDs and those who do not require the anti-inflammatory action of NSAIDs.
Acetaminophen is the analgesic/antipyretic of choice for children with viral infections or chickenpox (due to the risk
of Reye syndrome with aspirin).
1461
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1462 ---

B.  Pharmacokinetics
Acetaminophen is rapidly absorbed from the GI tract and undergoes significant first-pass metabolism. It is
conjugated in the liver to form inactive glucuronidated or sulfated metabolites. A portion of acetaminophen is
hydroxylated to form N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine, or NAPQI, a highly reactive metabolite that can react with
sulfhydryl groups and cause liver damage. At normal doses of acetaminophen, NAPQI reacts with the sulfhydryl
group of glutathione produced by the liver, forming a nontoxic substance (Figure 38.17). Acetaminophen and its
metabolites are excreted in urine. The drug is also available in intravenous and rectal formulations.

1464

--- PAGE 1465 ---

C.  Adverse effects
At normal therapeutic doses, acetaminophen has few significant adverse effects. With large doses of acetaminophen,
the available glutathione in the liver becomes depleted, and NAPQI reacts with the sulfhydryl groups of hepatic
proteins (see Figure 38.17). Hepatic necrosis, a serious and potentially life-threatening condition, can result. Patients
with hepatic disease, viral hepatitis, or a history of alcoholism are at higher risk of acetaminophen-induced
hepatotoxicity. [Note: N-acetylcysteine is an antidote in cases of overdose (see Chapter 44).] Acetaminophen should
be avoided in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

V.  Traditional Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs
Traditional DMARDs (methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide, or sulfasalazine) are used in the treatment of
RA and have been shown to slow the course of the disease, induce remission, and prevent further destruction of the
joints and involved tissues. Following diagnosis of RA, these agents should be started as soon as possible to delay
progression of the disease. Monotherapy may be initiated with any of the traditional DMARDs, although
methotrexate is generally preferred. For patients with inadequate response to monotherapy, a combination of
traditional DMARDs, or use of a TNF inhibitor or non-TNF biologic agent may be needed. NSAIDs or
glucocorticoids can also be used for their anti-inflammatory actions.
1466
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1467 ---

A.  Methotrexate
Methotrexate [meth-oh-TREX-ate] is a folic acid antagonist that inhibits cytokine production and purine nucleotide
biosynthesis, leading to immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects. It has become a mainstay of treatment in
patients with RA. Response to methotrexate usually occurs within 3 to 6 weeks of starting treatment. Other
traditional DMARDs, TNF inhibitors, or non-TNF biologic agents can be added to methotrexate if there is
inadequate response to monotherapy with this agent. Doses of methotrexate required for RA treatment are much
lower than those needed in cancer chemotherapy and are generally administered once weekly, thereby minimizing
adverse effects. Common adverse effects of methotrexate when used for RA are mucosal ulceration and nausea.
Cytopenias (particularly leukopenia), cirrhosis of the liver, and an acute pneumonia-like syndrome may occur with
chronic administration. [Note: Supplementation with folic acid may improve tolerability of methotrexate and reduce
GI and hepatic adverse effects.] Periodic liver function tests, complete blood counts, and monitoring for signs of
infection are recommended. Methotrexate is contraindicated in pregnancy.
1467
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1468 ---

B.  Hydroxychloroquine
Hydroxychloroquine [hye-drox-ee-KLOR-oh-kwin] is used for early, mild RA, and may be combined with
methotrexate. Its mechanism of action in autoimmune disorders is unknown, and onset of effects takes 6 weeks to 6
months. Hydroxychloroquine has less adverse effects on the liver and immune system than other DMARDs.
However, it may cause ocular toxicity, including irreversible retinal damage and corneal deposits, CNS
disturbances, GI upset, and skin discoloration and eruptions.
1468
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1469 ---

C.  Leflunomide
Leflunomide [le-FLOO-no-mide] is an immunomodulatory agent that preferentially causes cell arrest of the
autoimmune lymphocytes through its action on dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). After biotransformation,
leflunomide becomes a reversible inhibitor of DHODH, an enzyme necessary for pyrimidine synthesis (Figure
38.18). Leflunomide may be used as monotherapy in patients who have intolerance or contraindications to use of
methotrexate in RA, or it may be used in combination with methotrexate for patients with suboptimal response to
methotrexate alone. Common adverse effects include headache, diarrhea, and nausea. Other effects are weight loss,
allergic reactions, including a flu-like syndrome, skin rash, alopecia, and hypokalemia. The drug is not
recommended in patients with liver disease as it can be hepatotoxic. Leflunomide is contraindicated in pregnancy.
Monitoring parameters include signs of infection, complete blood count, electrolytes, and liver enzymes.

D.  Sulfasalazine
Sulfasalazine [sul-fa-SAH-la-zeen] has recommendations for use similar to leflunomide in the treatment of RA. Its
mechanism of action in treating RA is unclear. The onset of activity is 1 to 3 months, and it is associated with GI
adverse effects (nausea, vomiting, anorexia) and leukopenia.
1472
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1473 ---

E.  Glucocorticoids
Glucocorticoids (see Chapter 26) are potent anti-inflammatory drugs that are commonly used in patients with RA to
provide symptomatic relief and bridge the time until other DMARDs become effective. Glucocorticoids should
always be used at the lowest dose and for the shortest duration possible to avoid adverse effects associated with
long-term use.
1473

--- PAGE 1474 ---

VI.  Biologic Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs
IL-1 and TNF-α are proinflammatory cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of RA. When secreted by synovial
macrophages, IL-1 and TNF-α stimulate synovial cells to proliferate and synthesize collagenase, thereby degrading
cartilage, stimulating bone resorption, and inhibiting proteoglycan synthesis. The TNF-α inhibitors (adalimumab,
certolizumab, etanercept , golimumab, and infliximab) are biologic DMARDs which have been shown to decrease
signs and symptoms of RA, reduce progression of structural damage, and improve physical function. Clinical
response can be seen within 2 weeks of therapy. TNF-α inhibitors are usually employed in RA after a patient has an
inadequate response to traditional DMARDs. These agents may be used alone or in combination with traditional
DMARDs. If a patient has failed monotherapy with one TNF-α inhibitor, a traditional DMARD may be added, or
therapy with a non-TNF biologic agent or a different TNF-α inhibitor may be tried. TNF-α inhibitors should be used
cautiously in those with heart failure, as they can cause and/or worsen preexisting heart failure. An increased risk of
lymphoma and other cancers has been observed with the use of TNF-α inhibitors.
Biologic DMARDs include the TNF-α inhibitors, as well as the non-TNF biologic agents (abatacept , rituximab,
tocilizumab). Like TNF-α inhibitors, non-TNF biologics are generally used in RA after a patient has an inadequate
response to traditional DMARDs, and they may be used alone or in combination with traditional DMARDs. If a
patient has failed monotherapy with one non-TNF biologic, a trial of another non-TNF biologic with or without
methotrexate is warranted. Patients receiving biologic DMARDs are at increased risk for infections, such as
tuberculosis, fungal opportunistic infections, and sepsis. [Note: TNF-α inhibitors and non-TNF biologic agents
should not be used together due to the risk of severe infections.] Reactivation of hepatitis B may occur with the use
of these agents. Live vaccinations should not be administered to patients taking any of the biologic DMARDs.
Characteristics of the TNF-α inhibitors and non-TNF biologic therapies for the treatment of RA are outlined below.
[Note: TNF-α inhibitors find use in a number of disorders, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease (see Chapter
40), psoriasis, and ankylosing spondylitis.]

A.  Adalimumab
Adalimumab [AY-da-LIM-ue-mab] is a recombinant monoclonal antibody that binds to TNF-α and interferes with
its activity by blocking interaction of TNF-α with cell surface receptors. Adalimumab is administered
subcutaneously weekly or every other week. It may cause headache, nausea, agranulocytosis, rash, reaction at the
injection site, and increased risk of infections.
1475

--- PAGE 1476 ---

B.  Certolizumab
Certolizumab [ser-toe-LIZ-oo-mab] is a humanized antibody that neutralizes biological actions of TNF-α. It is
combined with polyethylene glycol (pegylated) and is administered every 2 weeks via subcutaneous injection.
Adverse effects are similar to other TNF-α inhibitors.

--- PAGE 1477 ---

C.  Etanercept
Etanercept  [ee-TAN-er-cept] is a genetically engineered fusion protein that binds to TNF-α, thereby blocking its
interaction with cell surface TNF-α receptors. The combination of etanercept  and methotrexate is more effective
than methotrexate or etanercept  alone in hindering the RA disease process, improving function, and achieving
remission (Figure 38.19). Etanercept  is given subcutaneously once weekly and is generally well tolerated.

D.  Golimumab
Golimumab [goe-LIM-ue-mab] neutralizes the biological activity of TNF-α by binding to it and blocking its
interaction with cell surface receptors. It is administered subcutaneously once a month in combination with
methotrexate. Golimumab may increase hepatic enzymes.
1478
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1479 ---

E.  Infliximab
Infliximab [in-FLIX-i-mab] is a chimeric monoclonal antibody composed of human and murine regions. The
antibody binds specifically to human TNF-α and inhibits binding with its receptors. This agent is not indicated for
monotherapy, as this leads to the development of anti-infliximab antibodies and reduced efficacy. Infliximab should
be administered with methotrexate. Infliximab is administered as an IV infusion every 8 weeks. Infusion-related
reactions, such as fever, chills, pruritus, and urticaria, may occur.
1479
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1480 ---

F.  Abatacept
T lymphocytes need two interactions to become activated: 1) the antigen-presenting cell (macrophages or B cells)
must interact with the receptor on the T cell and 2) the CD80/CD86 protein on the antigen-presenting cell must
interact with the CD28 protein on the T cell. Abatacept  [a-BAT-ah-cept] is a recombinant fusion protein and
costimulation modulator that competes with CD28 for binding on CD80/CD86 protein, thereby preventing full T-
cell activation and reducing the inflammatory response. Abatacept  is administered as an IV infusion every 4 weeks.
Common adverse effects include infusion-related reactions, headache, upper respiratory infections, and nausea.
1480
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1481 ---

G.  Rituximab
In RA, B lymphocytes can perpetuate the inflammatory process in the synovium by 1) activating T lymphocytes, 2)
producing autoantibodies and rheumatoid factor, and 3) producing proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and
IL-1. Rituximab [ri-TUK-si-mab] is a chimeric murine/human monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20
antigen found on the surface of normal and malignant B lymphocytes. Administration of rituximab results in B-cell
depletion. Rituximab is administered as an intravenous infusion every 16 to 24 weeks. To reduce infusion reactions,
methylprednisolone, acetaminophen, and an antihistamine are administered prior to each infusion. Infusion reactions
(urticaria, hypotension, and angioedema) are the most common complaints and typically occur during the first
infusion.
1481

--- PAGE 1482 ---

H.  Tocilizumab and sarilumab
Tocilizumab [toe-si-LIZ-ue-mab] and sarilumab [sar-IL-ue-mab] are recombinant monoclonal antibodies that bind
to IL-6 receptors and inhibit activity of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6. Both tocilizumab and sarilumab are
administered as a subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks. Tocilizumab may also be administered as an intravenous
infusion every 4 weeks. Adverse reactions to tocilizumab include elevated liver function tests, hyperlipidemia,
neutropenia, hypertension, and infusion-related and injection site reactions. Adverse reactions for sarilumab are
similar.

--- PAGE 1483 ---

VII.  Other Drugs for Rheumatoid Arthritis
Janus kinases are intracellular enzymes that modulate immune cell activity in response to the binding of
inflammatory mediators to the cellular membrane. Tofacitinib [toe-fa-SYE-ti-nib] is a synthetic small molecule that
is an oral inhibitor of Janus kinases. It is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe established RA in patients
who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate. Metabolism of tofacitinib is mediated
primarily by CYP3A4, and dosage adjustments may be required if the drug is taken with potent inhibitors or
inducers of this isoenzyme. Hemoglobin concentrations must be greater than 9 g/dL to start tofacitinib and must be
monitored during therapy due to the risk for anemia. Likewise, lymphocyte and neutrophil counts should be checked
prior to initiation of therapy and monitored during treatment. Tofacitinib treatment may also increase the risk for
new primary malignancy and opportunistic infections. Due to long-term safety concerns, tofacitinib is usually
reserved for patients who have inadequate response or intolerance to other agents. [Note: Anakinra, azathioprine,
cyclosporine, gold, and minocycline are other agents used infrequently in the treatment of RA due to their adverse
effect profile or the availability of other agents with more proven efficacy.]

VIII.  Drugs Used for the Treatment of Gout
Gout is a metabolic disorder characterized by high levels of uric acid in the blood (hyperuricemia). Hyperuricemia
can lead to deposition of sodium urate crystals in tissues, especially the joints and kidney. The deposition of urate
crystals initiates an inflammatory process involving the infiltration of granulocytes that phagocytize the urate
crystals (Figure 38.20). Acute flares of gout usually present as pain, swelling, tenderness, and redness in the affected
joints (for example, big toe, knees, ankles, wrists, or elbows). The cause of hyperuricemia in gout is an imbalance
between overproduction of uric acid and/or the inability to excrete uric acid renally. Most therapeutic strategies for
gout involve lowering the uric acid level below the saturation point (6 mg/dL), thus preventing the deposition of
urate crystals. This can be accomplished by interfering with uric acid synthesis or increasing uric acid excretion.

--- PAGE 1487 ---

A.  Treatment of acute gout
Acute gout attacks can result from a number of conditions, including excessive alcohol consumption, a diet rich in
purines, and kidney disease. NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and colchicine are effective agents for the management of
acute gouty arthritis. Indomethacin is considered the classic NSAID of choice, although all NSAIDs are likely to be
effective in decreasing pain and inflammation. Intra-articular administration of corticosteroids (when only one or
two joints are affected) is also appropriate in the acute setting, or systemic corticosteroids for more widespread joint
involvement. Patients are candidates for prophylactic urate-lowering therapy if they have more than two attacks per
year or they have chronic kidney disease, kidney stones, or tophi (deposit of urate crystals in the joints, bones,
cartilage, or other body structures).
1487
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1488 ---

B.  Treatment of chronic gout
Urate-lowering therapy for chronic gout aims to reduce the frequency of attacks and complications of gout.
Treatment strategies include the use of xanthine oxidase inhibitors to reduce the synthesis of uric acid or use of
uricosuric drugs to increase its excretion. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (allopurinol , febuxostat ) are first-line urate-
lowering agents. Uricosuric agents (probenecid) may be used in patients who are intolerant to xanthine oxidase
inhibitors or fail to achieve adequate response with those agents. [Note: Initiation of urate-lowering therapy can
precipitate an acute gout attack due to rapid changes in serum urate concentrations. Medications for the prevention
of an acute gout attack (low-dose colchicine, NSAIDs, or corticosteroids) should be initiated with urate-lowering
therapy and continued for at least 6 months.]
1488
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1489 ---

C.  Colchicine
Colchicine [KOL-chi-seen], a plant alkaloid, is used for the treatment of acute gouty attacks. It is neither a uricosuric
nor an analgesic agent, although it relieves pain in acute attacks of gout.
1.  Mechanism of action
Colchicine binds to tubulin, a microtubular protein, causing its depolymerization. This disrupts cellular functions,
such as the mobility of neutrophils, thus decreasing their migration into the inflamed joint. Furthermore, colchicine
blocks cell division by binding to mitotic spindles.
2.  Therapeutic uses
The anti-inflammatory activity of colchicine is specific for gout, usually alleviating the pain of acute gout within 12
hours. [Note: Colchicine must be administered within 36 hours of onset of attack to be effective.] NSAIDs have
largely replaced colchicine in the treatment of acute gouty attacks for safety reasons. Colchicine is also used as a
prophylactic agent to prevent acute attacks of gout in patients initiating urate-lowering therapy.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
Colchicine is administered orally and is rapidly absorbed from the GI tract. Colchicine is metabolized by hepatic
CYP450 3A4 and other tissues. It undergoes enterohepatic recirculation and exhibits high interpatient variability in
the elimination half-life. A portion of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine.
4.  Adverse effects
Colchicine may cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea ( Figure 38.21). Chronic administration may
lead to myopathy, neutropenia, aplastic anemia, and alopecia. The drug should not be used in pregnancy and should
be used with caution in patients with hepatic, renal, or cardiovascular disease. Dosage adjustments are required in
patients taking CYP3A4 inhibitors (for example, clarithromycin and itraconazole) or P-gp inhibitors (for example,
amiodarone and verapamil ) and those with severe renal impairment.

D.  Allopurinol
Allopurinol  [al-oh-PURE-i-nole], a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is a purine analog. It reduces the production of uric
acid by competitively inhibiting the last two steps in uric acid biosynthesis that are catalyzed by xanthine oxidase
(see Figure 38.20).
1.  Therapeutic uses
Allopurinol  is an effective urate-lowering therapy in the treatment of gout and hyperuricemia secondary to other
conditions, such as that associated with certain malignancies (those in which large amounts of purines are produced,
particularly after chemotherapy) or in renal disease.
2.  Pharmacokinetics
Allopurinol  is completely absorbed after oral administration. The primary metabolite alloxanthine (oxypurinol) is
also a xanthine oxidase inhibitor with a half-life of 15 to 18 hours. Thus, effective inhibition of xanthine oxidase can
be maintained with once-daily dosing. The drug and its active metabolite are excreted in the urine. Dose adjustment
is needed if estimated glomerular filtration rate is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2.
3.  Adverse effects
Allopurinol  is well tolerated by most patients. Hypersensitivity reactions, especially skin rashes, are the most
common adverse reactions. The risk is increased in those with reduced renal function. Because acute attacks of gout
may occur more frequently during the first several months of therapy, colchicine, NSAIDs, or corticosteroids can be
administered concurrently.
1492
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1493 ---

E.  Febuxostat
Febuxostat  [feb-UX-oh-stat] is an oral xanthine oxidase inhibitor structurally unrelated to allopurinol . Its adverse
effect profile is similar to that of allopurinol , although the risk for rash and hypersensitivity reactions may be
reduced. Febuxostat  does not have the same degree of renal elimination as allopurinol  and thus requires less
adjustment in those with reduced renal function. Febuxostat  should be used with caution in patients with a history of
heart disease or stroke, as this agent may be associated with a greater risk of these events as compared to
allopurinol .

F.  Probenecid
Probenecid [proe-BEN-a-sid] is an oral uricosuric drug. It is a weak organic acid that promotes renal clearance of
uric acid by inhibiting the urate-anion exchanger in the proximal tubule. At therapeutic doses, it blocks proximal
tubular reabsorption of uric acid. Probenecid should be avoided if the creatinine clearance is less than 50 mL/min.
Adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, and dermatologic reactions, and, rarely, anemia or anaphylactic reactions.

G.  Pegloticase
Pegloticase [peg-LOE-ti-kase] is a recombinant form of the enzyme urate oxidase or uricase. It acts by converting
uric acid to allantoin, a water-soluble nontoxic metabolite that is excreted primarily by the kidneys. Pegloticase is
indicated for patients with gout who fail treatment with standard therapies such as xanthine oxidase inhibitors. It is
administered as an IV infusion every 2 weeks. Infusion-related reactions and anaphylaxis may occur with
pegloticase, and patients should be premedicated with antihistamines and corticosteroids.

38.5Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
A 64-year-old man presents with mild to moderate musculoskeletal back pain. He states that he has tried
acetaminophen without relief. His medical history includes diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gastric
ulcer (resolved), and coronary artery disease. Which is the most appropriate NSAID regimen to treat this
patient’s pain?
A.  Celecoxib
B.  Indomethacin and omeprazole
C.  Naproxen and omeprazole
D.  Naproxen
Correct answer = C. This patient is at high risk of future ulcers, due to the history of gastric ulcer. Therefore,
using a regimen that includes an agent that is more COX-2 selective or a proton pump inhibitor is warranted.
Therefore, D is incorrect. Choices A and B are incorrect because this patient has significant cardiovascular risk
and a history of coronary artery disease. Naproxen is thought of as the safest NSAID regarding cardiovascular
disease, though it still can present risks. Therefore, C is correct as it uses the first-choice NSAID with the GI
protection of a proton pump inhibitor.
Which statement is correct regarding the difference between acetaminophen and naproxen?
A.  Acetaminophen has more anti-inflammatory effects compared with naproxen.
B.  Acetaminophen has more GI side effects but less effects on bleeding compared with naproxen.
C.  Acetaminophen has less risk for CV events compared with naproxen.
D.  Acetaminophen has fewer antipyretic effects than naproxen.
Correct answer = C. While acetaminophen inhibits prostaglandin synthesis via COX inhibition, it is inactivated
peripherally so it is devoid of systemic GI, CV, and bleeding adverse effects which are hallmarks of NSAIDs like
naproxen. However, as acetaminophen is active centrally, it is still able to maintain antipyretic effects similar to
other NSAIDs.
Which statement correctly describes the proposed mechanism of cardioprotection from low-dose aspirin?
A.  Aspirin preferentially inhibits COX-2 to lead to a relative reduction in thromboxane A2 levels.
B.  Aspirin preferentially inhibits COX-1 to lead to a relative reduction in thromboxane A2 levels.
C.  Aspirin preferentially inhibits COX-2 to lead to a relative reduction in prostacyclin levels.
D.  Aspirin preferentially inhibits COX-1 to lead a relative reduction in prostacyclin levels.
Correct answer = B. At low doses aspirin selectively inhibits COX-1, which reduces the production of
thromboxane A2, a substance that promotes vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation. COX-2 activity is thought
to lead to relatively higher levels of prostacyclin which causes vasodilation and inhibits platelet aggregation.
Selective COX-2 inhibitors, as well as all NSAIDs, may increase the risk for CV events by inhibiting the
beneficial production of prostacyclin by COX-2, thereby leading to a relative imbalance of thromboxane A2, and
promoting platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction.
Which statement correctly describes the pathophysiologic actions of prostaglandins at a target tissue?
A.  Promote vasoconstriction in the kidneys.
B.  Promote sodium and water retention in the kidneys.
C.  Decrease secretion of mucus at the lining of the stomach.
D.  Decrease secretion of gastric acid in the stomach.
Correct answer = D. Prostaglandins, specifically PGE2 and PGI2, cause vasodilation in the renal arteries; a
decrease in prostaglandins from NSAIDs can lead to vasoconstriction of renal arteries as well as sodium and
water retention. In the stomach, PGI2 inhibits gastric acid secretion, while PGE2 and PGF2α promote secretion of
protective mucus at the stomach lining.
Which prostaglandin agent can be used to maintain the patency of the ductus arteriosus in neonates with
congenital heart problems while awaiting surgery?
A.  Misoprostol
B.  Epoprostenol
C.  Bimatoprost
D.  Alprostadil
Correct answer = D. Misoprostol, a PGE1 analog, is used for GI protection or labor induction. Epoprostenol, a
PGI2 analog, is used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Bimatoprost, a PGF2α analog, is used
topically in the eye for the treatment of open angle glaucoma or on the lashes for hypotrichosis. Alprostadil, a
PGE1 analog, is used to maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus in neonates with congenital heart problems. The
drug can also be used for erectile dysfunction.1496

38.10A 34-year-old woman with RA is planning for pregnancy. Which RA agents are absolutely contraindicated
in pregnancy?
A.  Abatacept and rituximab
B.  Adalimumab and certolizumab
C.  Infliximab and etanercept
D.  Methotrexate and leflunomide
Correct answer = D. Both methotrexate and leflunomide are contraindicated in pregnancy. Data are limited in
other RA agents to confirm or rule out teratogenicity in pregnancy. The risk of RA treatment on the developing
fetus should be weighed against the benefits of improved RA symptoms with these therapies. Any adverse
outcomes should be reported to the pregnancy registry.
Which agent for RA competes with CD28 to prevent full T-cell activation?
A.  Sarilumab
B.  Abatacept
C.  Golimumab
D.  Adalimumab
Correct answer = B. Abatacept is a costimulation modulator that competes with CD28 to prevent its binding on
CD80/CD86 protein, resulting in reduced T-cell activation. Golimumab and adalimumab are both TNF-α
inhibitors, and sarilumab is an IL-6 inhibitor.
Which statement correctly represents the mechanism of action of tofacitinib in the treatment of RA?
A.  TNF-α inhibitor
B.  Janus kinase inhibitor
C.  IL-6 receptor blocker
D.  Dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor
Correct answer = B. Tofacitinib is an inhibitor of Janus kinases 1, 3, and, to a lesser extent, 2. Methotrexate
inhibits dihydrofolate reductase. Etanercept is an example of TNF-α inhibitor, and tocilizumab is an example of
an IL-6 inhibitor.
A 54-year-old man with gout is found to have an issue with renal excretion of uric acid. Which drug is an
oral agent that would target the cause of his acute gout attacks?
A.  Allopurinol
B.  Febuxostat
C.  Probenecid
D.  Pegloticase
Correct answer = C. Probenecid is a uricosuric agent that increases renal excretion by inhibiting the urate–anion
exchanger in the proximal tubule, thereby blocking reabsorption of uric acid and facilitating its excretion.
Allopurinol and febuxostat are xanthine oxidase inhibitors, which primarily act by decreasing uric acid
production. Pegloticase works by increasing renal excretion of uric acid; however, it is an IV infusion.
A 64-year-old man presents with signs and symptoms of an acute gouty flare. Which strategy is the least
likely to acutely improve his gout symptoms and pain?
A.  Naproxen
B.  Colchicine
C.  Probenecid
D.  Prednisone
Correct answer = C. Probenecid is a uricosuric agent indicated to lower serum urate levels to prevent gout attacks.
It is not indicated during acute gout flares and should not be started until after the resolution of an acute attack.
Naproxen, colchicine, and prednisone all represent viable treatment options that acutely reduce pain and
inflammation associated with acute gout attacks.1497

Drugs for Disorders of the Respiratory System

--- PAGE 1499 ---

I.  Overview
Asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and allergic rhinitis are commonly encountered respiratory
disorders. Each of these conditions may be associated with a troublesome cough, which may be the only presenting
complaint. Asthma is a chronic disease characterized by hyperresponsive airways that affects over 235 million
patients worldwide. This disorder is underdiagnosed and undertreated, creating a substantial burden to individuals
and families, and resulting in millions of emergency room visits. COPD is currently the fourth leading cause of
death in the world, and is predicted to become the third leading cause of death by 2030. Allergic rhinitis is a
common chronic disease and is characterized by itchy, watery eyes, runny nose, and a nonproductive cough that can
significantly decrease quality of life. Each of these respiratory conditions may be managed with a combination of
lifestyle changes and medications. Drugs used to treat respiratory conditions can be delivered topically to the nasal
mucosa, inhaled into the lungs, or given orally or parenterally for systemic absorption. Local delivery methods, such
as nasal sprays or inhalers, are preferred to target affected tissues while minimizing systemic adverse effects.
Medications used to treat common respiratory disorders are summarized in Figure 39.1.
Figure 39.1 Summary of drugs affecting the respiratory system. *Indicates intranasal
formulation. SABA = short-acting β2 agonist; LABA = long-acting β2 agonist; LAMA =
long-acting muscarinic antagonist.

II.  Preferred Drugs Used to Treat Asthma
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by episodes of acute bronchoconstriction that
cause shortness of breath, cough, chest tightness, wheezing, and rapid respiration.
1501
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1502 ---

A.  Pathophysiology of asthma
Airflow obstruction in asthma is due to bronchoconstriction that results from contraction of bronchial smooth
muscle, inflammation of the bronchial wall, and increased secretion of mucus ( Figure 39.2). The underlying
inflammation of the airways contributes to airway hyperresponsiveness, airflow limitation, respiratory symptoms,
and disease chronicity. Asthma attacks may be triggered by exposure to allergens, exercise, stress, and respiratory
infections. Unlike COPD, cystic fibrosis, and bronchiectasis, asthma is usually not a progressive disease. However,
if untreated, asthma may cause airway remodeling, resulting in increased severity and incidence of asthma
exacerbations and/or death.

--- PAGE 1505 ---

B.  Goals of therapy
Drug therapy for long-term control of asthma is designed to reverse and prevent airway inflammation. The goals of
asthma therapy are to decrease the intensity and frequency of asthma symptoms, prevent future exacerbations, and
minimize limitations in activity related to asthma symptoms. First-line drug therapy based on classification of
asthma is presented in Figure 39.3.
Figure 39.3 Guidelines for the treatment of asthma. In all asthmatic patients, quick relief
is provided by a SABA as needed for symptoms. *Eighty percent or more of predicted
function. ICS = inhaled corticosteroid; LABA = long-acting b2 agonist.
1505
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1506 ---

C.  β 2-Adrenergic agonists
Inhaled β2-adrenergic agonists directly relax airway smooth muscle. They are used for the quick relief of asthma
symptoms, as well as adjunctive therapy for long-term control of the disease.
1.  Quick relief
Short-acting β2 agonists (SABAs) have a rapid onset of action (5 to 30 minutes) and provide relief for 4 to 6 hours.
They are used for symptomatic treatment of bronchospasm, providing quick relief of acute bronchoconstriction. All
patients with asthma should receive a SABA inhaler for use as needed. β2 agonists have no anti-inflammatory
effects, and they should not be used as monotherapy for patients with persistent asthma. However, monotherapy
with SABAs may be appropriate for patients with mild, intermittent asthma or exercise-induced bronchospasm.
Direct-acting β2-selective agonists include albuterol  [al-BYOO-ter-all] and levalbuterol  [leh-val-BYOO-ter-all].
These agents provide significant bronchodilation with little of the undesired effect of α or β1 stimulation (see
Chapter 6). Adverse effects, such as tachycardia, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and β2-mediated
skeletal muscle tremors are minimized with inhaled delivery versus systemic administration.
2.  Long-term control
Salmeterol  [sal-MEE-ter-all] and formoterol  [for-MOE-ter-all] are long-acting β2 agonists (LABAs) and chemical
analogs of albuterol . Salmeterol  and formoterol  have a long duration of action, providing bronchodilation for at least
12 hours. Use of LABA monotherapy is contraindicated, and LABAs should be used only in combination with an
asthma controller medication, such as an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). ICS remain the long-term controllers of
choice in asthma, and LABAs are considered to be useful adjunctive therapy for attaining control in moderate to
severe asthma. Some LABAs are available as a combination product with an ICS (see Figure 39.1). Although both
LABAs are usually used on a scheduled basis to control asthma, adults and adolescents with moderate persistent
asthma can use the ICS/ formoterol  combination for relief of acute symptoms. Adverse effects of LABAs are similar
to quick-acting β2 agonists.
1506
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1507 ---

D.  Corticosteroids
ICS are the drugs of choice for long-term control in patients with persistent asthma ( Figure 39.3). Corticosteroids
(see Chapter 26) inhibit the release of arachidonic acid through inhibition of phospholipase A2, thereby producing
direct anti-inflammatory properties in the airways (Figure 39.4). To be effective in controlling inflammation, these
agents must be used regularly. Treatment of exacerbations or severe persistent asthma may require the addition of a
short course of oral or intravenous corticosteroids.

Figure 39.4 Sites of action for various respiratory medications. CysLT1 = cysteinyl
leukotriene-1.
1.  Actions on lung
ICS therapy directly targets underlying airway inflammation by decreasing the inflammatory cascade (eosinophils,
macrophages, and T lymphocytes), reversing mucosal edema, decreasing the permeability of capillaries, and
inhibiting the release of leukotrienes. After several months of regular use, ICS reduce the hyperresponsiveness of the
airway smooth muscle to a variety of bronchoconstrictor stimuli, such as allergens, irritants, cold air, and exercise.
2.  Routes of administration
a.  Inhalation
The development of ICS has markedly reduced the need for systemic corticosteroid treatment to achieve control of
asthma symptoms. However, as with all inhaled medications, appropriate inhalation technique is critical to the
success of therapy (see section on Inhaler Technique).
b.  Oral/systemic
Patients with a severe exacerbation of asthma (status asthmaticus) may require intravenous methylprednisolone or
oral prednisone to reduce airway inflammation. In most cases, suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal
cortex axis does not occur during the oral prednisone “burst” (short course) typically prescribed for an asthma
exacerbation. Thus, a dose taper is unnecessary prior to discontinuation.
3.  Adverse effects
Oral or parenteral corticosteroids have a variety of potentially serious adverse effects (see Chapter 26), whereas ICS,
particularly if used with a spacer, have few systemic effects. ICS deposition on the oral and laryngeal mucosa can
cause oropharyngeal candidiasis (due to local immune suppression) and hoarseness. Patients should be instructed to
rinse the mouth in a “swish-and-spit” method with water following use of the inhaler to decrease the chance of these
adverse events. Due to the potential for serious adverse effects, chronic maintenance with oral corticosteroids should
be reserved for patients who are not controlled on an ICS.
1509

--- PAGE 1510 ---

III.  Alternative Drugs Used to Treat Asthma
These drugs are useful for treatment of asthma in patients who are poorly controlled by conventional therapy or
experience adverse effects secondary to corticosteroid treatment. These drugs should be used in conjunction with
ICS therapy for most patients.
1510
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1511 ---

A.  Leukotriene modifiers
Leukotrienes (LT) B4 and the cysteinyl leukotrienes, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, are products of the 5-lipoxygenase
pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism and part of the inflammatory cascade. 5-Lipoxygenase is found in cells of
myeloid origin, such as mast cells, basophils, eosinophils, and neutrophils. LTB4 is a potent chemoattractant for
neutrophils and eosinophils, whereas the cysteinyl leukotrienes constrict bronchiolar smooth muscle, increase
endothelial permeability, and promote mucus secretion. Zileuton [zye-LOO-ton] is a selective and specific inhibitor
of 5-lipoxygenase, preventing the formation of both LTB4 and the cysteinyl leukotrienes. Zafirlukast  [za-FIR-loo-
kast] and montelukast  [mon-te-LOO-kast] are selective antagonists of the cysteinyl leukotriene-1 receptor, and they
block the effects of cysteinyl leukotrienes ( Figure 39.4). These agents are approved for the prevention of asthma
symptoms. They should not be used in situations where immediate bronchodilation is required. Leukotriene receptor
antagonists have also shown efficacy for the prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm.
1.  Pharmacokinetics
These agents are orally active and highly protein bound. Food impairs the absorption of zafirlukast . The drugs
undergo extensive hepatic metabolism. Zileuton and its metabolites are excreted in urine, whereas zafirlukast ,
montelukast , and their metabolites undergo biliary excretion.
2.  Adverse effects
Elevations in serum hepatic enzymes may occur with these drugs, requiring periodic monitoring and discontinuation
when enzymes exceed three to five times the upper limit of normal. Other effects include headache and dyspepsia.
Zafirlukast  is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes 2C8, 2C9, and 3A4, and zileuton inhibits
CYP1A2. Coadministration with drugs that are substrates of these isoenzymes may result in increased effects and/or
toxicity.
1511
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1512 ---

B.  Cromolyn
Cromolyn [KRO-moe-lin] is a prophylactic anti-inflammatory agent that inhibits mast cell degranulation and release
of histamine. It is an alternative therapy for mild persistent asthma and is available as a nebulized solution. Because
cromolyn is not a bronchodilator, it is not useful in managing an acute asthma attack. Due to its short duration of
action, this agent requires dosing three or four times daily, which affects adherence and limits its use. Adverse
effects are minor and include cough, irritation, and unpleasant taste.
1512
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1513 ---

C.  Cholinergic antagonists
The anticholinergic agents block vagally mediated contraction of airway smooth muscle and mucus secretion (see
Chapter 5). Inhaled ipratropium [IP-ra-TROE-pee-um], a short-acting quaternary derivative of atropine, is not
recommended for the routine treatment of acute bronchospasm in asthma, as its onset is much slower than that of
inhaled SABAs. However, it may be useful in patients who are unable to tolerate a SABA or patients with asthma–
COPD overlap syndrome. Ipratropium also offers additional benefit when used with a SABA for the treatment of
acute asthma exacerbations in the emergency department. Tiotropium [tye-oh-TROE-pee-um], a long-acting
anticholinergic agent, can be used as an add-on treatment in adult patients with severe asthma and a history of
exacerbations. Adverse effects such as xerostomia and bitter taste are related to local anticholinergic effects.
1513
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1514 ---

D.  Theophylline
Theophylline [thee-OFF-i-lin] is a bronchodilator that relieves airflow obstruction in chronic asthma and decreases
asthma symptoms. It may also possess anti-inflammatory activity, although the mechanism of action is unclear.
Previously, the mainstay of asthma therapy, theophylline has been largely replaced with β2 agonists and
corticosteroids due to its narrow therapeutic window, adverse effect profile, and potential for drug interactions.
Overdose may cause seizures or potentially fatal arrhythmias. Theophylline is metabolized in the liver and is a
CYP1A2 and 3A4 substrate. It is subject to numerous drug interactions. Serum concentration monitoring should be
performed when theophylline is used chronically.
1514
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1515 ---

E.  Monoclonal antibodies
Omalizumab [OH-ma-LIZ-oo-mab] is a monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to human immunoglobulin E
(IgE). This leads to decreased binding of IgE to its receptor on the surface of mast cells and basophils. Reduction in
surface-bound IgE limits the release of mediators of the allergic response. The monoclonal antibodies mepolizumab
[MEP-oh-LIZ-ue-mab], benralizumab [ben-ra-LIZ-ue-mab], and reslizumab [res-LIZ-ue-mab] are interleukin-5 (IL-
5) antagonists. IL-5 is the major cytokine involved in recruitment, activation, and survival of eosinophils in
eosinophilic asthma. These agents are indicated for the treatment of severe persistent asthma in patients who are
poorly controlled with conventional therapy. Their use is limited by the high cost, route of administration (IV for
reslizumab and subcutaneous for others), and adverse effect profile. Adverse effects include serious anaphylactic
reactions (rare), arthralgias, fever, rash, and increased risk of infections. New malignancies have been reported.
1515

--- PAGE 1516 ---

IV.  Drugs Used to Treat Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
COPD is a chronic, irreversible obstruction of airflow that is usually progressive and characterized by persistent
symptoms. These may include cough, excess mucus production, chest tightness, breathlessness, difficulty sleeping,
and fatigue. Although symptoms are similar to asthma, the characteristic irreversible airflow obstruction of COPD is
one of the most significant differences between the diseases. Smoking is the greatest risk factor for COPD and is
directly linked to the progressive decline of lung function, as demonstrated by forced expiratory volume in one
second (FEV1). Smoking cessation should be recommended regardless of stage and severity of COPD, or the age of
patient. Drug therapy for COPD is aimed at relief of symptoms and prevention of disease progression.
Unfortunately, with currently available care, many patients still experience a decline in lung function over time.
1516
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1517 ---

A.  Bronchodilators
Inhaled bronchodilators, including the β2-adrenergic agonists and anticholinergic agents (muscarinic antagonists),
are the foundation of therapy for COPD ( Figure 39.5). These drugs increase airflow, alleviate symptoms, and
decrease exacerbations. The long-acting bronchodilators, LABAs and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs),
are preferred as first-line treatment of COPD for all patients except those who are at low risk with less symptoms.
LABAs include once-daily indacaterol  [in-da-KA-ter-ol], olodaterol  [OH-loe-DAT-er-ol], and vilanterol  [vye-
LAN-ter-ol], as well as the twice-daily inhaled formulations of arformoterol , formoterol , and salmeterol . Aclidinium
[A-kli-DIN-ee-um], tiotropium, glycopyrrolate [GLYE-koe-PIR-oh-late], and umeclidinium [ue-ME-kli-DIN-ee-
um]) are LAMAs. The combination of an anticholinergic and a β2 agonist may be helpful in patients who have
inadequate response to a single inhaled bronchodilator and are at risk of exacerbations.
Figure 39.5 Guidelines for the pharmacologic therapy of stable chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease. FEV1 = forced expiratory volume in 1 second; ICS = inhaled
corticosteroid; LABA = long-acting β2 agonist; LAMA = long-acting muscarinic
antagonist; SABA = short-acting β2 agonist.
1517
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1518 ---

B.  Corticosteroids
The addition of an ICS to a long-acting bronchodilator may improve symptoms, lung function, and quality of life in
COPD patients with FEV1 of less than 60% predicted or patients with symptoms of both asthma and COPD.
However, ICS treatment in COPD should be restricted to these patients, since use is associated with an increased
risk of pneumonia. Although often used for acute exacerbations, oral corticosteroids are not recommended for long-
term treatment of COPD.
1518
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1519 ---

C.  Other agents
Roflumilast  [roe-FLUE-mi-last] is an oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor used to reduce exacerbations in patients
with severe chronic bronchitis. Although its activity is not well defined in COPD, it is theorized to reduce
inflammation by increasing levels of intracellular cAMP in lung cells. Roflumilast  is not a bronchodilator and is not
indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm. Its use is limited by common adverse effects including weight loss,
nausea, diarrhea, and headache. In COPD, the use of theophylline has largely been replaced by the more effective
and tolerable long-acting bronchodilators.

--- PAGE 1520 ---

V.  Inhaler Technique
Appropriate inhaler technique differs between metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) and dry powder inhalers (DPIs). Proper
technique is critical to the success of therapy, and inhaler technique should be assessed regularly.
1520
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1521 ---

A.  Metered-dose inhalers and dry powder inhalers
MDIs have propellants that eject the active medication from the canister. Patients should be instructed to exhale
before they actuate the inhaler, and then begin to inhale slowly as they press the canister and continue inhaling
slowly and deeply throughout actuation. This technique avoids impaction of the medication onto the laryngeal
mucosa and facilitates the drug reaching the site of action in the bronchial smooth muscle. A large fraction (typically
80% to 90%) of inhaled medication (for example, corticosteroids) is either deposited in the mouth and pharynx or
swallowed (Figure 39.6). The remaining 10% to 20% of a dose of inhaled glucocorticoids that is not swallowed
reaches the site of action in the airway. Use of appropriate technique with ICS reduces the risk of systemic
absorption and adverse effects. DPIs require a different inhaler technique. Patients should be instructed to inhale
quickly and deeply to optimize drug delivery to the lungs. Patients using any type of inhaled corticosteroid device
should be instructed to rinse the mouth after use to prevent the development of oral candidiasis.

B.  Spacers
A spacer is a large-volume chamber attached to an MDI. The chamber reduces the velocity of the aerosol before
entering the mouth, allowing large drug particles to be deposited in the device. The smaller, higher-velocity drug
particles are less likely to be deposited in the mouth and more likely to reach the target airway tissue (Figure 39.7).
Patients should be advised to wash and/or rinse spacers to reduce the risk of bacterial or fungal growth that may
induce an asthma attack.

VI.  Drugs Used to Treat Allergic Rhinitis
Rhinitis is an inflammation of the mucous membranes of the nose and is characterized by sneezing, itchy nose/eyes,
watery rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and sometimes a nonproductive cough. An attack may be precipitated by
inhalation of an allergen (such as dust, pollen, or animal dander). The foreign material interacts with mast cells
coated with IgE generated in response to a previous allergen exposure. The mast cells release mediators, such as
histamine, leukotrienes, and chemotactic factors that promote bronchiolar spasm and mucosal thickening from
edema and cellular infiltration. Antihistamines and/or intranasal corticosteroids are preferred therapies for allergic
rhinitis.
1525
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1526 ---

A.  Antihistamines
Oral antihistamines (H1 receptor antagonists; see Chapter 37) have a fast onset of action and are useful for the
management of symptoms of allergic rhinitis caused by histamine release, such as sneezing, watery rhinorrhea, and
itchy eyes/nose. However, they are more effective for prevention of symptoms in mild or intermittent disease, rather
than treatment once symptoms have begun. First-generation antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine and
chlorpheniramine, are usually not preferred due to adverse effects, such as sedation, performance impairment, and
other anticholinergic effects. The second-generation antihistamines (for example, fexofenadine, loratadine,
desloratadine, cetirizine) are generally better tolerated. Ophthalmic and nasal antihistamine delivery devices are
available for targeted, topical tissue delivery. Examples of topical intranasal antihistamines include olopatadine
[OH-loe-PA-ta-deen] and azelastine [a-ZEL-uh-steen]. Intranasal antihistamines provide increased delivery of the
drug with fewer adverse effects. Combinations of antihistamines with decongestants (see below) are effective when
congestion is a feature of rhinitis, or when patients have no response or incomplete control of symptoms with
intranasal corticosteroids.

B.  Corticosteroids
Intranasal corticosteroids, such as beclomethasone, budesonide, fluticasone, ciclesonide, mometasone, and
triamcinolone, are the most effective medications for treatment of allergic rhinitis. With an onset of action that
ranges from 3 to 36 hours after first dose, intranasal corticosteroids improve sneezing, itching, rhinorrhea, and nasal
congestion. Systemic absorption is minimal, and adverse effects of treatment are localized. These include nasal
irritation, nosebleed, sore throat, and, rarely, candidiasis. To minimize systemic absorption, patients should be
instructed to avoid deep inhalation during administration into the nose, because the target tissue is the nose, not the
lungs or the throat. For patients with chronic rhinitis, improvement may not be seen until 1 to 2 weeks after starting
therapy.

C.  α-Adrenergic agonists
Short-acting α-adrenergic agonists (“nasal decongestants”), such as phenylephrine, constrict dilated arterioles in the
nasal mucosa and reduce airway resistance. Longer-acting oxymetazoline [OX-i-me-TAZ-oh-leen] is also available.
When administered intranasally, these drugs have a rapid onset of action and show few systemic effects. However,
intranasal formulations of α-adrenergic agonists should be used for no longer than 3 days due to the risk of rebound
nasal congestion (rhinitis medicamentosa). For this reason, the α-adrenergic agents are not used in the long-term
treatment of allergic rhinitis. Administration of oral α-adrenergic agonists results in a longer duration of action but
also increased systemic effects, such as increased blood pressure and heart rate (see Chapter 6). As with intranasal
formulations, regular use of oral α-adrenergic agonists ( phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine) alone or in
combination with antihistamines is not recommended.

D.  Other agents
Intranasal cromolyn may be useful in allergic rhinitis, particularly when administered before contact with an
allergen. To optimize the therapeutic effect, dosing should begin at least 1 to 2 weeks prior to allergen exposure.
Although potentially inferior to other treatments, some leukotriene receptor antagonists are effective for allergic
rhinitis as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. They may be a reasonable option in patients who also
have asthma. An intranasal formulation of ipratropium is available to treat rhinorrhea associated with allergic
rhinitis or the common cold. It does not relieve sneezing or nasal congestion.

VII.  Drugs Used to Treat Cough
Coughing is an important defense mechanism of the respiratory system in response to irritants and is a common
reason for patients to seek medical care. A troublesome cough may represent several etiologies, such as the common
cold, sinusitis, or an underlying chronic respiratory disease. In some cases, cough may be an effective defense reflex
against an underlying bacterial infection and should not be suppressed. Before treating cough, identification of its
cause is important to ensure that antitussive treatment is appropriate. The priority should always be to treat the
underlying cause of cough when possible.
1530
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1531 ---

A.  Opioids
Codeine [KOE-deen], an opioid, decreases the sensitivity of cough centers in the central nervous system to
peripheral stimuli and decreases mucosal secretion. These therapeutic effects occur at doses lower than those
required for analgesia. However, common adverse effects, such as constipation, dysphoria, and fatigue, still occur.
In addition, codeine has addictive potential, which limits its use, given increasing concerns with opioid addiction in
the United States (see Chapter 14). Dextromethorphan [dex-troe-meth-OR-fan] is a synthetic derivative of morphine
that has no analgesic effects in antitussive doses. It has a better adverse effect profile than does codeine and is
equally effective for cough suppression. In low doses, dextromethorphan has a low addictive profile. However, it is
also a potential drug of abuse, since it may cause dysphoria at high doses. Guaifenesin [gwye-FEN-e-sin], an
expectorant, is available as a single-ingredient formulation and is commonly found in combination cough products
with codeine or dextromethorphan.
1531

--- PAGE 1532 ---

B.  Benzonatate
Unlike the opioids, benzonatate [ben-ZOE-na-tate] suppresses the cough reflex through peripheral action. It
anesthetizes the stretch receptors located in the respiratory passages, lungs, and pleura. Adverse effects include
dizziness, numbness of the tongue, mouth, and throat. These localized effects may be particularly problematic if the
capsules are broken or chewed and the drug comes in direct contact with the oral mucosa.

39.5Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
A 12-year-old girl with asthma presents to the emergency room with complaints of cough, dyspnea, and
wheezing after visiting a riding stable. Which is the most appropriate drug to rapidly reverse her
bronchoconstriction?
A.  Inhaled fluticasone
B.  Inhaled beclomethasone
C.  Inhaled albuterol
D.  Intravenous propranolol
Correct answer = C. Inhalation of a rapid-acting β2 agonist, such as albuterol, usually provides immediate
bronchodilation. An acute asthmatic crisis often requires intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone.
Inhaled corticosteroids such as beclomethasone and fluticasone treat chronic airway inflammation but do not
provide any immediate effect. Propranolol is a nonselective β-blocker and would aggravate the
bronchoconstriction.
A 9-year-old girl has severe asthma that required three hospitalizations in the past year. She is now receiving
therapy that has greatly reduced the frequency of severe attacks. Which drug is most likely responsible for
this benefit?
A.  Inhaled albuterol
B.  Inhaled ipratropium
C.  Inhaled fluticasone
D.  Oral zafirlukast
Correct answer = C. Administration of an inhaled corticosteroid such as fluticasone significantly reduces the
frequency of severe asthma attacks. This benefit is accomplished with minimal risk of the severe systemic
adverse effects of oral corticosteroid therapy. The β2 agonist albuterol is used to treat acute asthma symptoms.
Ipratropium has more common use in COPD and sometimes in the acute management of acute asthma
exacerbations. Zafirlukast may reduce the severity of attacks, but not to the same degree or consistency as
fluticasone (or other corticosteroids).
A 68-year-old man has COPD with moderate airway obstruction. Despite using salmeterol twice daily, he
reports continued symptoms of shortness of breath with mild exertion. Which agent is an appropriate
addition to his current therapy?
A.  Systemic corticosteroids
B.  Albuterol
C.  Tiotropium
D.  Roflumilast
Correct answer = C. The addition of an anticholinergic bronchodilator to the LABA salmeterol would be
appropriate and provide additional therapeutic benefit. Systemic corticosteroids are used to treat exacerbations in
patients with COPD, but not recommended for chronic use. The addition of a SABA (albuterol) is less likely to
provide additional benefit since the patient is already using medication with the same mechanism of action.
Roflumilast is not indicated, since the patient only has moderate airway obstruction.
A 58-year-old woman with COPD has been hospitalized three times in the past year for COPD
exacerbations. She reports only mild symptoms between exacerbations. Her regimen for the past year has
included inhaled salmeterol twice daily and inhaled tiotropium once daily. Her current FEV1 is below 60%.
Which is an appropriate change in her drug therapy?
A.  Discontinue the tiotropium.
B.  Discontinue the salmeterol.
C.  Change the salmeterol to a combination product that includes both a LABA and an inhaled corticosteroid (for
example, salmeterol/fluticasone DPI).
D.  Add theophylline.
Correct answer = C. The addition of an inhaled corticosteroid may provide additional benefit since the patient has
significant airway obstruction and frequent exacerbations requiring hospitalization. It is not routinely
recommended to discontinue a long-acting bronchodilator unless the patient experiences an adverse effect or
experiences no therapeutic benefit. In this case, the patient reports mild symptoms in between exacerbations,
suggesting she may benefit from both bronchodilators. Theophylline is an oral bronchodilator that is beneficial to
some patients with stable COPD. However, because of its toxic potential, its use is not routinely recommended.
A 32-year-old man with a history of opioid addiction presents with cough due to a viral upper respiratory
system infection. Which is appropriate symptomatic treatment for cough in this patient?
A.  Guaifenesin/dextromethorphan
B.  Guaifenesin/codeine1533

39.6
39.7
39.8
39.9
39.10C.  Benzonatate
D.  Montelukast
Correct answer = C. Benzonatate suppresses the cough reflex through peripheral action and has no abuse
potential. Dextromethorphan, an opioid derivative, and codeine, an opioid, both have abuse potential.
Montelukast is not indicated for cough suppression.
Because of its anti-inflammatory mechanism of action, which drug requires regular administration for the
treatment of asthma?
A.  Tiotropium
B.  Salmeterol
C.  Mometasone
D.  Albuterol
Correct answer = C. Inhaled corticosteroids have direct anti-inflammatory properties on the airways and require
regular dosing to be effective. Tiotropium is used more frequently for the treatment of COPD. It does not have
anti-inflammatory effects like the corticosteroids. Salmeterol and albuterol are both bronchodilators, but do not
have anti-inflammatory properties.
Which agent is a preferred antihistamine for the management of allergic rhinitis?
A.  Chlorpheniramine
B.  Diphenhydramine
C.  Phenylephrine
D.  Cetirizine
Correct answer = D. Chlorpheniramine and diphenhydramine are first-generation antihistamines and are usually
not a preferred treatment due to their increased risk of adverse effects, such as sedation, performance impairment,
and other anticholinergic effects. Phenylephrine is short-acting α-adrenergic agonist (“nasal decongestant”).
Cetirizine is a second-generation antihistamine and is generally better tolerated, making it a preferred agent for
allergic rhinitis.
Which medication inhibits the action of 5-lipoxygenase and consequently the action of leukotriene B4 and
the cysteinyl leukotrienes?
A.  Cromolyn
B.  Zafirlukast
C.  Zileuton
D.  Montelukast
Correct answer = C. Zileuton is the only 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor available. While zafirlukast and montelukast
both inhibit the effects of leukotrienes, they do so by blocking the receptor. Cromolyn inhibits mast cell
degranulation and the release of histamine.
Which statement describes appropriate inhaler technique for a dry powder inhaler?
A.  Inhale slowly and deeply just before and throughout actuation of the inhaler.
B.  Use a large-volume chamber (spacer) to decrease deposition of drug in the mouth caused by improper inhaler
technique.
C.  Inhale quickly and deeply to optimize drug delivery to the lungs.
D.  Rinse mouth in a “swish-and-spit” method with water prior to inhaler use to decrease the chance of adverse
events.
Correct answer = C. “Quick and deep” inhalation is required for effective use of a DPI. Inhaling “slowly and
deeply” and the use of a spacer describe techniques associated with an MDI, not DPI. Rinsing the mouth may be
appropriate for either type of inhaler if the medication being administered is an inhaled corticosteroid; however,
this should always be done following inhaler use, not prior to use.
Which category of allergic rhinitis medications is most likely to be associated with rhinitis medicamentosa
(rebound nasal congestion) with prolonged use?
A.  Intranasal corticosteroid
B.  Intranasal decongestant
C.  Leukotriene antagonist
D.  Oral antihistamine
Correct answer = B. Intranasal decongestants should be used no longer than 3 days due to the risk of rebound
nasal congestion (rhinitis medicamentosa). For this reason, the α-adrenergic agents should not be used in the
long-term treatment of allergic rhinitis. The other agents may be used as chronic therapies.1534

--- PAGE 1537 ---

I.  Overview
This chapter describes drugs used to treat six common medical conditions involving the gastrointestinal (GI) tract:
1) peptic ulcers and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), 2) chemotherapy-induced emesis, 3) diarrhea, 4)
constipation, 5) irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and 6) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Many drugs
described in other chapters also find application in the treatment of GI disorders. For example, the meperidine
derivative diphenoxylate, which decreases peristaltic activity of the gut, is useful in the treatment of severe diarrhea.
Other drugs are used almost exclusively to treat GI tract disorders. For example, H2 receptor antagonists and proton
pump inhibitors (PPIs) are used to heal peptic ulcers.
1537

--- PAGE 1538 ---

II.  Drugs Used to Treat Peptic Ulcer Disease and
Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease
The two main causes of peptic ulcer disease are infection with gram-negative Helicobacter pylori  and the use of
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Increased hydrochloric acid (HCl) secretion and inadequate
mucosal defense against gastric acid also play a role. Treatment approaches include 1) eradicating the H. pylori
infection, 2) reducing secretion of gastric acid with the use of PPIs or H2 receptor antagonists, and/or 3) providing
agents that protect the gastric mucosa from damage, such as misoprostol  and sucralfate. Figure 40.1 summarizes
agents that are effective in treating peptic ulcer disease.

A.  Antimicrobial agents
Patients with peptic ulcer disease (duodenal or gastric ulcers) who are infected with H. pylori  require antimicrobial
treatment. Infection with H. pylori  is diagnosed via endoscopic biopsy of the gastric mucosa or various noninvasive
methods, including serology, fecal antigen tests, and urea breath tests (Figure 40.2). Figure 40.3 shows a biopsy
sample in which H. pylori  is discovered on the gastric mucosa. Eradication of H. pylori  with various combinations
of antimicrobial drugs results in rapid healing of active ulcers and low recurrence rates (less than 15%, compared
with 60% to 100% per year for ulcers healed with acid-reducing therapy alone). Currently, quadruple therapy of
bismuth subsalicylate, metronidazole, and tetracycline plus a PPI is a recommended first-line option. This usually
results in a 90% or greater eradication rate. Triple therapy consisting of a PPI combined with amoxicillin
(metronidazole may be used in penicillin-allergic patients) plus clarithromycin is a preferred treatment when rates of
clarithromycin resistance are low and the patient has no prior exposure to macrolide antibiotics.

B.  H 2 receptor antagonists
Gastric acid secretion is stimulated by acetylcholine, histamine, and gastrin (Figure 40.4). The receptor-mediated
binding of acetylcholine, histamine, or gastrin results in the activation of protein kinases, which in turn stimulates
the H+/K+-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) proton pump to secrete hydrogen ions in exchange for K+ into the
lumen of the stomach. By competitively blocking the binding of histamine to H2 receptors, these agents reduce the
secretion of gastric acid. The four drugs used in the United States—cimetidine [si-MET-ih-deen], famotidine [fa-
MOE-ti-deen], nizatidine [nye-ZA-ti-deen], and ranitidine [ra-NI-ti-deen]—inhibit basal, food-stimulated, and
nocturnal secretion of gastric acid, reducing acid secretion by approximately 70%. Cimetidine was the first H2
receptor antagonist. However, its utility is limited by its adverse effect profile and drug–drug interactions.
Figure 40.4 Effects of acetylcholine, histamine, prostaglandin E2, and gastrin on gastric
acid secretion by the parietal cells of stomach. Gs and Gi are membrane proteins that
mediate the stimulatory or inhibitory effect of receptor coupling to adenylyl cyclase.
1.  Actions
The histamine H2 receptor antagonists act selectively on H2 receptors in the stomach, without effects on H1
receptors. They are competitive antagonists of histamine and are fully reversible.
2.  Therapeutic uses
The use of these agents has decreased with the advent of PPIs.
a.  Peptic ulcers
All four agents are equally effective in promoting the healing of duodenal and gastric ulcers. However, recurrence is
common if H. pylori  is present and the patient is treated with these agents alone. Patients with NSAID-induced
ulcers should be treated with PPIs, because these agents heal and prevent future ulcers more effectively than do H2
receptor antagonists.
b.  Acute stress ulcers
These drugs are given as an intravenous infusion to prevent and manage acute stress ulcers associated with high-risk
patients in the intensive care setting. However, because tolerance may occur with these agents, PPIs are also used for
this indication.
c.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease
H2 receptor antagonists are effective for the treatment of heartburn or GERD. H2 receptor antagonists act by
decreasing acid secretion; therefore, they may not relieve symptoms of heartburn for up to 45 minutes. Antacids
more quickly and efficiently neutralize stomach acid, but their action is short lived. For these reasons, PPIs are now
used preferentially in the treatment of GERD, especially for patients with severe and frequent heartburn.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
After oral administration, the H2 receptor antagonists distribute widely throughout the body (including into breast
milk and across the placenta) and are excreted mainly in the urine. Cimetidine, ranitidine, and famotidine are also1544
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1545 ---

available in intravenous formulations. The half-life of these agents may be increased in patients with renal
dysfunction, and dosage adjustments are needed.
4.  Adverse effects
In general, the H2 receptor antagonists are well tolerated. However, cimetidine can have endocrine effects, such as
gynecomastia and galactorrhea (continuous release/discharge of milk), because it acts as a nonsteroidal
antiandrogen. Other central nervous system effects such as confusion and altered mentation occur primarily in
elderly patients and after intravenous administration. H2 receptor antagonists may reduce the efficacy of drugs that
require an acidic environment for absorption, such as ketoconazole. Cimetidine inhibits several cytochrome P450
isoenzymes and can interfere with the metabolism of many drugs, such as warfarin, phenytoin, and clopidogrel
(Figure 40.5).
Figure 40.5 Drug interactions with cimetidine .
1545
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1546 ---

C.  Inhibitors of the H+/K+-ATPase proton pump
The PPIs bind to the H+/K+-ATPase enzyme system (proton pump) and suppress the secretion of hydrogen ions into
the gastric lumen. The membrane-bound proton pump is the final step in the secretion of gastric acid ( Figure 40.4).
The available PPIs include dexlansoprazole [DEX-lan-SO-pra-zole], esomeprazole [es-oh-MEH-pra-zole],
lansoprazole [lan-SO-pra-zole], omeprazole [oh-MEH-pra-zole], pantoprazole [pan-TOE-pra-zole], and
rabeprazole [rah-BEH-pra-zole].
1.  Actions
These agents are prodrugs with an acid-resistant enteric coating to protect them from premature degradation by
gastric acid. The coating is removed in the alkaline duodenum, and the prodrug, a weak base, is absorbed and
transported to the parietal cell. There, it is converted to the active drug and forms a stable covalent bond with the
H+/K+-ATPase enzyme. It takes about 18 hours for the enzyme to be resynthesized, and acid secretion is inhibited
during this time. At standard doses, PPIs inhibit both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion by more than 90%.
An oral product containing omeprazole combined with sodium bicarbonate for faster absorption is also available.
2.  Therapeutic uses
The PPIs are superior to the H2 antagonists in suppressing acid production and healing ulcers. Thus, they are the
preferred drugs for the treatment of GERD, erosive esophagitis, active duodenal ulcer, and pathologic
hypersecretory conditions such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. PPIs reduce the risk of bleeding from ulcers caused
by aspirin and other NSAIDs and may be used for prevention or treatment of NSAID-induced ulcers. PPIs are also
used for stress ulcer prophylaxis and management. Finally, PPIs are combined with antimicrobial regimens used to
eradicate H. pylori.
3.  Pharmacokinetics
These agents are effective orally. For maximum effect, PPIs should be taken 30 to 60 minutes before breakfast or the
largest meal of the day. [Note: Dexlansoprazole has a dual delayed-release formulation and can be taken without
regard to food.] Esomeprazole, lansoprazole, and pantoprazole are available in intravenous formulations. Although
the plasma half-life of these agents is only a few hours, they have a long duration of action due to covalent bonding
with the H+/K+-ATPase enzyme. Metabolites of these agents are excreted in urine and feces.
4.  Adverse effects
The PPIs are generally well tolerated. Omeprazole and esomeprazole may decrease the effectiveness of clopidogrel
because they inhibit CYP2C19 and prevent the conversion of clopidogrel  to its active metabolite. Concomitant use
of these PPIs with clopidogrel  is not recommended. PPIs may increase the risk of fractures, particularly if the
duration of use is 1 year or greater (Figure 40.6). Prolonged acid suppression with PPIs (and H2 receptor
antagonists) may result in low vitamin B12 because acid is required for its absorption in a complex with intrinsic
factor. Elevated gastric pH may also impair the absorption of calcium carbonate. Calcium citrate is an effective
option for calcium supplementation in patients on acid suppressive therapy, since absorption of the citrate salt is not
affected by gastric pH. Diarrhea and Clostridium difficile  colitis may occur in patients receiving PPIs. Patients must
be counseled to discontinue PPI therapy and contact their physician if they have diarrhea for several days.
Additional adverse effects may include hypomagnesemia and an increased incidence of pneumonia.

D.  Prostaglandins
Prostaglandin E, produced by the gastric mucosa, inhibits secretion of acid and stimulates secretion of mucus and
bicarbonate (cytoprotective effect). A deficiency of prostaglandins is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of
peptic ulcers. Misoprostol  [mye-soe-PROST-ole], an analog of prostaglandin E1, is approved for the prevention of
NSAID-induced gastric ulcers ( Figure 40.7). Prophylactic use of misoprostol  should be considered in patients who
take NSAIDs and are at moderate to high risk of NSAID-induced ulcers, such as elderly patients and those with
previous ulcers. Misoprostol  is contraindicated in pregnancy, since it can stimulate uterine contractions and cause
miscarriage. Dose-related diarrhea is the most common adverse effect and limits the use of this agent. Thus, PPIs are
preferred agents for the prevention of NSAID-induced ulcers.
Figure 40.7 Misoprostol reduces serious gastrointestinal (GI) complications in patients
with rheumatoid arthritis receiving NSAIDs.
1549
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1550 ---

E.  Antacids
Antacids are weak bases that react with gastric acid to form water and a salt to diminish gastric acidity. Because
pepsin (a proteolytic enzyme) is inactive at a pH greater than 4, antacids also reduce pepsin activity.
1.  Chemistry
Antacid products vary widely in their chemical composition, acid-neutralizing capacity, sodium content, and
palatability. The efficacy of an antacid depends on its capacity to neutralize gastric HCl and on whether the stomach
is full or empty. Food delays stomach emptying, allowing more time for the antacid to react and prolonging the
duration of action. Commonly used antacids are combinations of salts of aluminum and magnesium, such as
aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide [Mg(OH)2]. Calcium carbonate [CaCO3] reacts with HCl to form
CO2 and CaCl2 and is also a commonly used preparation. Systemic absorption of sodium bicarbonate [NaHCO3]
can produce transient metabolic alkalosis and produce a significant sodium load. Therefore, this antacid is not
recommended.
2.  Therapeutic uses
Antacids are used for symptomatic relief of peptic ulcer disease, heartburn, and GERD. They should be administered
after meals for maximum effectiveness. [Note: Calcium carbonate preparations are also used as calcium
supplements for the prevention of osteoporosis.]
3.  Adverse effects
Aluminum hydroxide tends to cause constipation, whereas magnesium hydroxide tends to produce diarrhea.
Preparations that combine these agents aid in normalizing bowel function. Absorption of the cations from antacids
(Mg2+, Al3+, Ca2+) is usually not a problem in patients with normal renal function; however, accumulation and
adverse effects may occur in patients with renal impairment.
1550
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1551 ---

F.  Mucosal protective agents
Also known as cytoprotective compounds, these agents have several actions that enhance mucosal protection
mechanisms, thereby preventing mucosal injury, reducing inflammation, and healing existing ulcers.
1.  Sucralfate
This complex of aluminum hydroxide and sulfated sucrose binds to positively charged groups in proteins of both
normal and necrotic mucosa. By forming complex gels with epithelial cells, sucralfate [soo-KRAL-fate] creates a
physical barrier that protects the ulcer from pepsin and acid, allowing the ulcer to heal. Although sucralfate is
effective for the treatment of duodenal ulcers and prevention of stress ulcers, its use is limited due to the need for
multiple daily dosing, drug–drug interactions, and availability of more effective agents. Because it requires an acidic
pH for activation, sucralfate should not be administered with PPIs, H2 antagonists, or antacids. Sucralfate is well
tolerated, but it can bind to other drugs and interfere with their absorption.
2.  Bismuth subsalicylate
This agent is used as a component of quadruple therapy to heal H. pylori-related peptic ulcers. In addition to its
antimicrobial actions, it inhibits the activity of pepsin, increases secretion of mucus, and interacts with glycoproteins
in necrotic mucosal tissue to coat and protect the ulcer.

III.  Drugs Used to Control Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and
Vomiting
Although nausea and vomiting occur in a variety of conditions (for example, motion sickness, pregnancy, and GI
illnesses) and are always unpleasant for the patient, the nausea and vomiting produced by chemotherapeutic agents
demands especially effective management. Nearly 70% to 80% of patients who undergo chemotherapy experience
nausea and/or vomiting. Several factors influence the incidence and severity of chemotherapy-induced nausea and
vomiting (CINV), including the specific chemotherapeutic drug (Figure 40.8); the dose, route, and schedule of
administration; and patient variables. For example, young patients and women are more susceptible than older
patients and men, and 10% to 40% of patients experience nausea and/or vomiting in anticipation of chemotherapy
(anticipatory vomiting). CINV not only affects quality of life but can also lead to rejection of potentially curative
chemotherapy. In addition, uncontrolled vomiting can produce dehydration, profound metabolic imbalances, and
nutrient depletion.

A.  Mechanisms that trigger vomiting
Two brainstem sites have key roles in the vomiting reflex pathway. The chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) is located
in the area postrema (a circumventricular structure at the caudal end of the fourth ventricle). It is outside the blood–
brain barrier. Thus, it can respond directly to chemical stimuli in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid. The second
important site, the vomiting center, which is located in the lateral reticular formation of the medulla, coordinates the
motor mechanisms of vomiting. The vomiting center also responds to afferent input from the vestibular system, the
periphery (pharynx and GI tract), and higher brainstem and cortical structures. The vestibular system functions
mainly in motion sickness.

Chemotherapeutic agents can directly activate the medullary CTZ or vomiting center. Several neuroreceptors,
including dopamine receptor type 2 and serotonin type 3 (5-HT3), play critical roles. Often, the color or smell of
chemotherapeutic drugs (and even stimuli associated with chemotherapy) can activate higher brain centers and
trigger emesis. Chemotherapeutic drugs can also act peripherally by causing cell damage in the GI tract and by
releasing serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine. Serotonin activates 5-HT3 receptors on
vagal and splanchnic afferent fibers, which then carry sensory signals to the medulla, leading to the emetic response.

C.  Antiemetic drugs
Considering the complexity of the mechanisms involved in emesis, it is not surprising that antiemetics represent a
variety of classes (Figure 40.9) and offer a range of efficacies (Figure 40.10). Anticholinergic drugs, especially the
muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine and H1-receptor antagonists, such as dimenhydrinate, meclizine, and
cyclizine, are very useful in motion sickness but are ineffective against substances that act directly on the CTZ. The
major categories of drugs used to control CINV include the following:

--- PAGE 1557 ---

Figure 40.10 Efficacy of antiemetic drugs.
1.  Phenothiazines
Phenothiazines, such as prochlorperazine [proe-klor-PER-ah-zeen], act by blocking dopamine receptors in the CTZ.
Prochlorperazine is effective against low or moderately emetogenic chemotherapeutic agents (for example,
fluorouracil  and doxorubicin). Although increasing the dose improves antiemetic activity, adverse effects are dose
limiting.
2.  5-HT 3 receptor blockers
The 5-HT3 receptor antagonists include dolasetron [dol-A-seh-tron], granisetron [gra-NI-seh-tron], ondansetron
[on-DAN-seh-tron], and palonosetron [pa-low-NO-seh-tron]. These agents selectively block 5-HT3 receptors in the
periphery (visceral vagal afferent fibers) and in the CTZ. This class of agents is important in treating CINV, because
of their superior efficacy and longer duration of action. These drugs can be administered as a single dose prior to
chemotherapy (intravenously or orally) and are efficacious against all grades of emetogenic therapy. Ondansetron
and granisetron prevent emesis in 50% to 60% of cisplatin-treated patients. These agents are also useful in the
management of postoperative nausea and vomiting. 5-HT3 antagonists are extensively metabolized by the liver;
however, only ondansetron requires dosage adjustments in hepatic insufficiency. Excretion is via the urine. QT
prolongation can occur with high doses of ondansetron and dolasetron. For this reason, the indication for CINV
prophylaxis was withdrawn for intravenous dolasetron.
3.  Substituted benzamides
One of several substituted benzamides with antiemetic activity, metoclopramide [met-oh-kloe-PRAH-mide], is
effective at high doses against the emetogenic cisplatin, preventing emesis in 30% to 40% of patients and reducing
emesis in the majority of patients. Metoclopramide accomplishes this through inhibition of dopamine in the CTZ.
Antidopaminergic adverse effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms, limit long-term high-dose use.
Metoclopramide enhances gastric motility and is useful for patients with gastroparesis.
4.  Butyrophenones
Droperidol  [droe-PER-i-doll] and haloperidol  [hal-oh-PER-i-doll] act by blocking dopamine receptors. The
butyrophenones are moderately effective antiemetics. Droperidol  had been used most often for sedation in
endoscopy and surgery, usually in combination with opioids or benzodiazepines. However, it may prolong the QTc
interval and should be reserved for patients with inadequate response to other agents.
1557
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1558 ---

5.  Benzodiazepines
The antiemetic potency of lorazepam [lor-A-ze-pam] and alprazolam [al-PRAH-zoe-lam] is low. Their beneficial
effects may be due to their sedative, anxiolytic, and amnestic properties (see Chapter 9). These properties make
benzodiazepines useful in treating anticipatory vomiting. Concomitant use of alcohol should be avoided due to
additive CNS depressant effects.
6.  Corticosteroids
Dexamethasone [dex-a-MEH-tha-sone] and methylprednisolone [meth-ill-pred-NIH-so-lone], used alone, are
effective against mildly to moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. Most frequently, they are used in combination
with other agents. Their antiemetic mechanism is not known, but it may involve blockade of prostaglandins.
7.  Substance P/neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists
Aprepitant  [ah-PRE-pih-tant], netupitant  [net-UE-pi-tant], and rolapitant  [roe-LA-pi-tant] target the neurokinin
receptor in the vomiting center and block the actions of substance P. [Note: Fosaprepitant  is a prodrug of aprepitant
that is administered intravenously.] These oral agents are indicated for highly or moderately emetogenic
chemotherapy regimens, and they are usually administered with dexamethasone and a 5-HT3 antagonist. Unlike
most 5-HT3 antagonists, these agents are effective for the delayed phase of CINV, which occurs 24 hours or more
after chemotherapy. Aprepitant  and rolapitant  undergo hepatic metabolism, primarily by CYP3A4.
Coadministration with strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 (for example, clarithromycin or St. John’s wort ,
respectively) should be avoided. Aprepitant  is an inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, and it also exhibits dose-
dependent inhibition of CYP3A4. Therefore, it may affect the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of these
isoenzymes and is subject to numerous drug interactions. Rolapitant  is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6. Fatigue,
diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hiccups are adverse effects of this class.
8.  Combination regimens
Antiemetic drugs are often combined to increase efficacy or decrease toxicity (Figure 40.11). Corticosteroids, most
commonly dexamethasone, increase antiemetic activity when given with high-dose metoclopramide, a 5-HT3
antagonist, phenothiazine, butyrophenone, or a benzodiazepine. Antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine, are often
administered in combination with high-dose metoclopramide to reduce extrapyramidal reactions or with
corticosteroids to counter metoclopramide-induced diarrhea. Addition of a substance P/neurokinin-1 receptor
antagonist to a 5-HT3 antagonist and dexamethasone is beneficial in highly emetogenic regimens, especially those
with delayed CINV.

IV.  Antidiarrheals
Increased motility of the GI tract and decreased absorption of fluid are major factors in diarrhea. Antidiarrheal drugs
include antimotility agents, adsorbents, and drugs that modify fluid and electrolyte transport (Figure 40.12).
Figure 40.12 Summary of drugs used to treat diarrhea.
1560
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1561 ---

A.  Antimotility agents
Two drugs that are widely used to control diarrhea are diphenoxylate [dye-fen-OKS-i-late] and loperamide [loe-
PER-ah-mide]. Both are analogs of meperidine and have opioid-like actions on the gut. They activate presynaptic
opioid receptors in the enteric nervous system to inhibit acetylcholine release and decrease peristalsis. At the usual
doses, they lack analgesic effects. Loperamide is used for the general treatment of acute diarrhea, including
traveler’s diarrhea. Because these drugs can contribute to toxic megacolon, they should not be used in young
children or in patients with severe colitis.
1561
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1562 ---

B.  Adsorbents
Adsorbent agents, such as aluminum hydroxide and methylcellulose [METH-il-SEL-yoo-los], are used to control
diarrhea. Presumably, these agents act by adsorbing intestinal toxins or microorganisms and/or by coating or
protecting the intestinal mucosa. They are much less effective than antimotility agents, and they can interfere with
the absorption of other drugs.
1562
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1563 ---

C.  Agents that modify fluid and electrolyte transport
Bismuth subsalicylate, used for prevention and treatment of traveler’s diarrhea, decreases fluid secretion in the
bowel. Its action may be due to its salicylate component as well as its coating action. Adverse effects may include
black tongue and black stools.
1563
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1564 ---

V.  Laxatives
Laxatives are commonly used in the treatment of constipation to accelerate the motility of the bowel, soften the
stool, and increase the frequency of bowel movements. These drugs are classified on the basis of their mechanism of
action (Figure 40.13). Laxatives increase the potential for loss of pharmacologic effect of poorly absorbed, delayed-
acting, and extended-release oral preparations by accelerating their transit through the intestines. They may also
cause electrolyte imbalances when used chronically. Many of these drugs have a risk of dependency for the user.
Figure 40.13 Summary of drugs used to treat constipation.
1564
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1565 ---

A.  Irritants and stimulants
1.  Senna
This agent is a widely used stimulant laxative. Its active ingredient is a group of sennosides, a natural complex of
anthraquinone glycosides. Taken orally, senna causes evacuation of the bowels within 6 to 12 hours. It also causes
water and electrolyte secretion into the bowel. In combination products with a docusate-containing stool softener, it
is useful in treating opioid-induced constipation.
2.  Bisacodyl
Available as suppositories and enteric-coated tablets, bisacodyl  [bis-ak-oh-dil] is a potent stimulant of the colon. It
acts directly on nerve fibers in the mucosa of the colon.
3.  Castor oil
This agent is broken down in the small intestine to ricinoleic acid, which is very irritating to the stomach and
promptly increases peristalsis. Pregnant patients should avoid castor oil  because it may stimulate uterine
contractions. Use of castor oil  is generally not recommended due to poor palatability and potential for GI adverse
effects.
1565
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1566 ---

B.  Bulk laxatives
The bulk laxatives include hydrophilic colloids (from indigestible parts of fruits and vegetables). They form gels in
the large intestine, causing water retention and intestinal distension, thereby increasing peristaltic activity. Similar
actions are produced by methylcellulose, psyllium seeds, and bran. They should be used cautiously in patients who
are immobile because of their potential for causing intestinal obstruction. Psyllium can reduce the absorption of
other oral drugs, and administration of other agents should be separated from psyllium by at least two hours.
1566
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1567 ---

C.  Saline and osmotic laxatives
Saline cathartics, such as magnesium citrate and magnesium hydroxide, are nonabsorbable salts (anions and cations)
that hold water in the intestine by osmosis. This distends the bowel, increasing intestinal activity and producing
defecation in a few hours. Electrolyte solutions containing polyethylene glycol  (PEG) are used as colonic lavage
solutions to prepare the gut for radiologic or endoscopic procedures. PEG powder for solution without electrolytes is
also used as a laxative and has been shown to cause less cramping and gas than other laxatives. Lactulose is a
semisynthetic disaccharide sugar that acts as an osmotic laxative. It cannot be hydrolyzed by GI enzymes. Oral
doses reach the colon and are degraded by colonic bacteria into lactic, formic, and acetic acids. This increases
osmotic pressure, causing fluid accumulation, colon distension, soft stools, and defecation. Lactulose is also used for
the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy, due to its ability to reduce ammonia levels.
1567

--- PAGE 1568 ---

D.  Stool softeners (emollient laxatives or surfactants)
Surface active agents that become emulsified with the stool produce softer feces and ease passage of stool. These
include docusate sodium and docusate calcium. They may take days to become effective and are often used for
prophylaxis rather than acute treatment. Stool softeners should not be taken concomitantly with mineral oil  because
of the potential for absorption of the mineral oil .
1568
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1569 ---

E.  Lubricant laxatives
Mineral oil  and glycerin suppositories are lubricants and act by facilitating the passage of hard stools. Mineral oil
should be taken orally in an upright position to avoid its aspiration and potential for lipid or lipoid pneumonia.
1569
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1570 ---

F.  Chloride channel activators
Lubiprostone [loo-bee-PROS-tone] works by activating chloride channels to increase fluid secretion in the intestinal
lumen. This eases the passage of stools and causes little change in electrolyte balance. Lubiprostone is used in the
treatment of chronic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C), particularly because
tolerance or dependency has not been associated with this drug. Also, drug–drug interactions are minimal because
metabolism occurs quickly in the stomach and jejunum.

--- PAGE 1571 ---

VI.  Irritable Bowel Syndrome
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits in the absence
of an organic cause. IBS may be classified as constipation predominant (IBS-C), diarrhea predominant (IBS-D), or a
combination of both. Diet and psychosocial modifications play an important role in management of the disease, as
well as drug therapy (Figure 40.14). Key characteristics of medications used for the treatment of IBS-C and IBS-D
are provided in Figure 40.15.

bowel syndrome with constipation; IBS-D = irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea.

VII.  Drugs Used to Treat Inflammatory Bowel Disease
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of idiopathic chronic intestinal conditions characterized by immune-
mediated GI tract inflammation in response to bacterial antigens in the intestinal lumen. The most common subtypes
of IBD are Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). CD can affect any portion of the GI tract from the
mouth to the anus in a noncontinuous fashion and is characterized by transmural inflammation. UC usually affects
the rectum. It may extend continuously to affect other parts of the colon, and is characterized by inflammation
limited to the mucosal layer (Figure 40.16). Severity, extent of disease, and risk of complications guide treatment of
IBD. Remission of IBD can be induced with the use of rectal and oral 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASAs), corticosteroids
(rectal, oral locally delivered and systemic), and biologic agents (TNF-α inhibitors, α-4 integrin inhibitors, and the
IL-12/23 inhibitor ustekinumab). Drugs used to maintain remission are the same as those used for induction. The
immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and methotrexate) are additional agents used in the
maintenance of remission in IBD. Figure 40.17 summarizes agents used in the treatment of IBD.
Figure 40.16 Distribution patterns of disease with (A) skip lesions in Crohn’s disease and
(B) continuous involvement of the colon, beginning with the rectum, in ulcerative colitis.

--- PAGE 1575 ---

A.  5-Aminosalicylates
Two types of 5-ASA compounds exist, the azo compounds and the mesalamine compounds. The azo compounds are
prodrugs that consist of a 5-ASA molecule bound via an azo (N=N) bond to another molecule. These include
balsalazide [bal-SAL-a-zide], olsalazine [ole-SAL-a-zeen], and sulfasalazine [SUL-fa-SAL-a-zeen]. The oral
mesalamine [me-SAL-a-meen] compounds consist of single 5-ASA molecules enclosed within an enteric coat or a
semipermeable membrane. The first 5-ASA agent used in the treatment of IBD, sulfasalazine, is a prodrug
consisting of 5-ASA linked to sulfapyridine. Colonic bacteria cleave sulfasalazine to produce 5-ASA (mesalamine)
and sulfapyridine (Figure 40.18). When it became known that 5-ASA was responsible for the efficacy of
sulfasalazine while sulfapyridine was mainly responsible for its adverse effects, unlinked 5-ASA formulations were
produced. However, unlinked 5-ASA is rapidly absorbed, with only 20% reaching the site of action in the terminal
ileum and colon. Therefore, other azo bonded compounds and various formulations of mesalamine were developed
to limit absorption of 5-ASA in the proximal GI tract and allow increased drug delivery to the colon. These
formulations differ in their sites of topical delivery within the intestinal tract and dosing frequency (Figure 40.19).
Compared to sulfasalazine, the mesalamine formulations and the other azo compounds have improved tolerability
with similar efficacy, making them the mainstay of therapy in UC.
Figure 40.18 Sulfasalazine metabolism.
Figure 40.19 5-Aminosalicylate formulations.
1.  Actions
The 5-ASAs exhibit anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties that are the main determinants of their
efficacy in IBD. The exact mechanism of action of 5-ASA is unknown but is thought to be due in part to 1)
inhibition of cytokine synthesis, 2) inhibition of leukotriene and prostaglandin synthesis, 3) scavenging of free
radicals, 4) inhibition of T-cell proliferation, activation, and differentiation, and 5) impairment of leukocyte adhesion
and function. 5-ASA is thought to act via topical interaction with the intestinal mucosa and the mechanisms are the
same with both oral and rectal administration.
2.  Therapeutic uses
The 5-ASA drugs are the mainstay of treatment in UC. All 5-ASA formulations and sulfasalazine are indicated in
UC for induction and maintenance of remission. Current guidelines recommend these agents as first line for mild–
moderate disease. Use of 5-ASA drugs in CD is limited due to a general lack of efficacy.1575
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1576 ---

3.  Pharmacokinetics
5-ASA (mesalamine) pharmacokinetics are variable and dependent on route of administration (for example, rectal
vs. oral), type of oral formulation (see Figure 40.19), and disease activity. Absorption of 5-ASA increases with more
severe disease and decreases with decreasing pH. In UC, 5-ASAs work by local effect. Therefore, the 5-ASA
preparations deliver drug to the colon for maximal intestinal exposure. Absorption of rectally administered
mesalamine and systemic exposure depends on rectal retention time. Due to the topical mechanism of action,
differences in systemic exposure are not related to efficacy but may be important for adverse effects. Sulfasalazine is
administered orally, with the sulfapyridine component having significant absorption (60% to 80%).
3.  Adverse effects
Adverse effects of sulfasalazine occur in up to 45% of patients, with the majority due to the sulfapyridine
component. Headache, nausea, and fatigue are most common and are dose related. Serious reactions include
hemolytic anemia, myelosuppression, hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephrotoxicity, fever, rash, and Stevens-Johnson
syndrome. Treatment should be discontinued at the first sign of skin rash or hypersensitivity. Sulfasalazine
reversibly impairs male fertility. Sulfasalazine also inhibits intestinal folate absorption, and folate supplementation is
recommended with chronic use. The newer mesalamine formulations are well tolerated; headache and dyspepsia are
the most common adverse effects. Rarely, acute interstitial nephritis may occur and renal function should be
monitored in patients receiving mesalamine. Watery diarrhea occurs in up to 20% of patients treated with olsalazine.
Some formulations of mesalamine depend on pH for their release (see Figure 40.19) and coadministration of drugs
that increase pH (for example, PPIs, H2 receptor antagonists, and antacids) may result in increased systemic
absorption and premature release of 5-ASA before reaching the site of action. Concomitant use should be avoided or
another formulation of 5-ASA that is non-pH dependent should be used (for example, olsalazine, balsalazide).
1576

--- PAGE 1577 ---

B.  Corticosteroids
Corticosteroids are used in IBD for their anti-inflammatory effects as they are in other inflammatory conditions (see
Chapter 26). Although very effective at inducing remission in IBD, long-term maintenance with corticosteroids
should be avoided due to the deleterious effects of chronic use. Rectal formulations (for example, hydrocortisone
enema and budesonide foam) have fewer adverse effects than systemic steroids but use is limited to left-sided
disease in UC. Enteric-release preparations of oral budesonide deliver corticosteroid to a portion of inflamed
intestine. This agent has minimal systemic adverse effects due to low bioavailability resulting from extensive first-
pass hepatic metabolism. Delayed-release budesonide delivers drug to the terminal ileum and proximal large bowel
and is used in ileocecal CD. Extended-release budesonide delivers drug throughout the colon and is used in UC
patients with pancolitis. Although systemic exposure is less than other corticosteroids, the use of budesonide in
extended maintenance of remission is limited due to concerns with long-term use.
1577

--- PAGE 1578 ---

C.  Biologic agents
The TNF-α inhibitors, α-4 integrin inhibitors, and the IL-12/23 inhibitor ustekinumab are biologic agents used in the
management of IBD. Use of these agents is associated with an increased risk for infection. Patients should be
evaluated for tuberculosis and treatment for latent TB should be considered prior to use of these drugs. Many of
these agents have other therapeutic indications such as rheumatoid arthritis (see Chapter 38) or psoriasis (see
Chapter 43). The actions, pharmacokinetics, and adverse effects of these drugs in other conditions are similar in
IBD.
1.  TNF-α inhibitors
TNF-α inhibitors are parenteral agents that are effective for both induction and maintenance of remission in IBD.
Infliximab [in-FLIX-ih-mab] and adalimumab [AY-da-LIM-ue-mab] are indicated in both moderate–severe CD and
UC. Certolizumab [SER-toe-LIZ-oo-mab] is indicated for moderate–severe CD, and golimumab [goe-LIM-ue-mab]
is indicated for moderate–severe UC. The TNF-α inhibitors are generally reserved as second-line agents in patients
with UC who have failed 5-ASAs, are unresponsive to or dependent on corticosteroids, or who present with more
severe disease. In CD, the TNF-α inhibitors have a first-line role in patients with moderate–severe disease and those
at higher risk of progression and worse outcomes. These agents are associated with the development of
immunogenicity and antidrug antibodies that can result in loss of response in a significant proportion of patients.
2.  α-4 integrin inhibitors
α-4 Integrins are adhesion molecules that promote leukocyte migration to sites of inflammation. Use of α-4 integrin
inhibitors reduces lymphocyte migration into the intestinal mucosa and inflammation. The use of α-4 integrin
inhibitors in IBD is reserved for disease refractory to TNF-α inhibitors. Vedolizumab [VE-doe-LIZ-ue-mab] exhibits
specific binding to α-4/β-7 integrin and is indicated for refractory UC and CD. The most common adverse reactions
include headache, arthralgia, nausea, fatigue, and musculoskeletal pain.
3.  IL-12/23 inhibitor
Ustekinumab [YOO-sti-KIN-ue-mab] inhibits the cytokines IL-12 and IL-23 involved in lymphocyte activation. It is
indicated for psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and induction and maintenance of remission in CD in patients refractory to
or intolerant of TNF-α inhibitors, immunomodulators, or corticosteroids. Common adverse effects include headache,
arthralgia, infection, nausea, and nasopharyngitis.
1578

--- PAGE 1579 ---

D.  Immunomodulators
The immunomodulator drugs most often used in IBD are methotrexate and the thiopurines azathioprine and 6-
mercaptopurine (6-MP ). Methotrexate (MTX ) also has therapeutic applications in cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and
psoriasis (see Chapters 35, 38, and 43) and azathioprine is sometimes used in kidney transplant (see Chapter 36).
The actions, pharmacokinetics, and adverse effects of the immunomodulators in other conditions are similar in IBD.
1.  Methotrexate
MTX  is a structural analogue of folic acid that inhibits the production of folinic acid. The exact mechanism of action
in CD is unknown. Only intramuscular or subcutaneous administration of MTX  has efficacy in CD. MTX  is a
recommended monotherapy option for maintenance of remission in CD, but is not recommended in maintenance for
UC. Common adverse effects of MTX  are headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, serum
aminotransferase elevations, and rash. Daily administration of folic acid is effective at reducing the incidence of GI
adverse effects and is recommended in patients receiving MTX .
2.  Thiopurines
The thiopurines azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP ) are oral medications that have corticosteroid-sparing
effects in patients with UC and CD. They are considered first line as monotherapy for maintenance of remission.
Use of thiopurines in IBD is limited by concerns of toxicity, including bone marrow suppression and hepatotoxicity.
Monitoring of complete blood counts and liver function tests is recommended in all patients treated with a
thiopurine.

40.6Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
A 68-year-old patient with cardiac failure is diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She begins using cisplatin but
becomes nauseous and suffers from severe vomiting. Which drug would be most effective to counteract the
emesis in this patient without exacerbating her cardiac problem?
A.  Droperidol
B.  Dolasetron
C.  Prochlorperazine
D.  Palonosetron
Correct answer = D. Palonosetron is a 5-HT3 antagonist that is effective against drugs with high emetogenic
activity, such as cisplatin. Although dolasetron is also in this category, its propensity to affect the heart makes it a
poor choice for this patient. Droperidol is only a moderately effective antiemetic and has the potential to prolong
the QTc interval, so it is not preferred in this patient. The antiemetic effect of prochlorperazine, a phenothiazine,
is most beneficial against anticancer drugs with moderate to low emetogenic properties.
A 45-year-old woman complains of severe persistent heartburn and an unpleasant, acid-like taste in her
mouth. The clinician suspects that she has gastroesophageal reflux disease. Which drug is most appropriate?
A.  An antacid such as aluminum hydroxide
B.  Dicyclomine
C.  Granisetron
D.  Esomeprazole
Correct answer = D. It is appropriate to treat this patient with a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) to reduce acid
production and promote healing. An H2 receptor antagonist might also be effective, but the PPIs are preferred. An
antacid would decrease gastric acid, but its effects are short lived compared to those of the PPIs and H2 receptor
antagonists. Dicyclomine is an antimuscarinic drug that is mainly used as an antispasmodic for IBS. The 5-HT3
receptor antagonist granisetron is an antiemetic, and not appropriate for the treatment of GERD.
A couple celebrating their 30th wedding anniversary are given a trip to Peru to visit Machu Picchu. Because
of past experiences while traveling, they ask their doctor to prescribe an agent in case they experience
diarrhea. Which drug would be effective?
A.  Omeprazole
B.  Loperamide
C.  Famotidine
D.  Lubiprostone
Correct answer = B. Loperamide is the only drug that has antidiarrheal activity. Omeprazole is a proton-pump
inhibitor, famotidine antagonizes the H2 receptor to reduce acid production, and lubiprostone is indicated for
chronic constipation or IBS-C.
A 27-year-old woman who is 34 weeks’ pregnant is on bed rest and is experiencing mild constipation. Which
drug is most appropriate for her?
A.  Castor oil
B.  Docusate
C.  Mineral oil
D.  Loperamide
Correct answer = B. Although its effects are not immediate, docusate may be used for mild constipation and is
generally considered safe in pregnancy. Castor oil should not be used in pregnancy because of its ability to cause
uterine contractions. Mineral oil should not be used in bedridden patients due to the possibility of aspiration.
Loperamide is used for diarrhea, not constipation.
Which drug has been known to cause discoloration of the tongue?
A.  Amoxicillin
B.  Omeprazole
C.  Bismuth subsalicylate
D.  Lubiprostone
Correct answer = C. Bismuth subsalicylate compounds may cause a harmless black discoloration of the tongue.
The other agents have not been associated with this effect.
An elderly woman with a recent history of myocardial infarction is seeking a medication to help treat her
occasional heartburn. She is currently taking several medications, including aspirin, clopidogrel, simvastatin,
metoprolol, and lisinopril. Which drug should be avoided in this patient?1580

40.9
40.10A.  Calcium citrate
B.  Famotidine
C.  Omeprazole
D.  Ranitidine
Correct answer = C. Omeprazole may possibly decrease the efficacy of clopidogrel because it inhibits the
conversion of clopidogrel to its active form.
Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) have been associated with which drug?
A.  Metoclopramide
B.  Sucralfate
C.  Aprepitant
D.  Bisacodyl
Correct answer = A. Only metoclopramide has been associated with EPS. This is due to its ability to inhibit
dopamine activity.
Which agent for gastrointestinal problems is contraindicated in pregnancy?
A.  Calcium carbonate
B.  Famotidine
C.  Lansoprazole
D.  Misoprostol
Correct answer = D. Misoprostol, a synthetic prostaglandin analog, is contraindicated in pregnancy because it
may stimulate uterine contractions. The other medications may be used during pregnancy for the treatment of
heartburn (common in pregnancy) or peptic ulcer disease.
A patient presents with a 2-month history of crampy right lower quadrant abdominal pain. Results of
endoscopy are consistent with moderate Crohn’s disease involving the terminal ileum and proximal large
intestine. Which drug is best to initiate in this patient at this time?
A.  Extended-release budesonide
B.  Delayed-release budesonide
C.  Mesalamine enema
D.  Ustekinumab
Correct answer = B. Delayed-release budesonide is indicated in Crohn’s disease because it releases in the
terminal ileum and proximal large bowel and is effective in inducing remission. Extended-release budesonide,
although effective at inducing remission, is only indicated in ulcerative colitis because it does not release in the
small bowel and would not be expected to be effective in this patient’s ileal disease. Mesalamine enema is only
effective on the distal large intestine. Ustekinumab is only indicated in patients who are refractory or intolerant to
TNF-α inhibitors.
A patient with a history of ulcerative colitis well controlled on mesalamine (Apriso) presents with epigastric
pain and dark tarry stools. He is found to have a duodenal ulcer and is prescribed esomeprazole for 8 weeks.
At follow-up 2 weeks later, his epigastric pain and dark tarry stools are resolved. However, he reports having
increased lower abdominal pain and increased stool frequency. Which change in drug therapy is appropriate
at this time?
A.  Change esomeprazole to omeprazole due to interaction with mesalamine (Apriso).
B.  Discontinue esomeprazole.
C.  Change mesalamine (Apriso) to mesalamine (Asacol).
D.  Change mesalamine (Apriso) to olsalazine (Dipentum).
Correct Answer = D. The patient seems to be having increased symptoms of ulcerative colitis after starting the
PPI, esomeprazole. The pH-dependent release formulations of mesalamine have a significant interaction with the
PPIs, which may lead to early release and loss of efficacy. A is incorrect because omeprazole is expected to have
the same interaction. B is incorrect because this patient still requires therapy with a PPI. C is incorrect because
Asacol is also pH-dependent release and is likely to be affected. D is correct because olsalazine is not pH
dependent and release relies on cleavage by colonic bacteria.1581

Drugs for Urologic Disorders
Katherine Vogel Anderson and Kaylie Smith

--- PAGE 1583 ---

I.  Overview
Erectile dysfunction (ED) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) are common urologic disorders in males. ED is
the inability to maintain penile erection for the successful performance of sexual activity. ED has many physical and
psychological causes, including vascular disease, diabetes, medications, depression, and sequelae to prostatic
surgery. It is estimated to affect more than 30 million men in the United States. BPH is nonmalignant enlargement of
the prostate, which occurs naturally as men age. As the prostate grows in size, lower urinary tract symptoms
develop, which can significantly impact a patient's quality of life. A summary of drugs for ED and BPH is provided
in Figure 41.1.
Figure 41.1 Summary of drugs used for the treatment of urologic disorders.
1583

--- PAGE 1584 ---

II.  Drugs Used to Treat Erectile Dysfunction
Therapy for ED includes penile implants, intrapenile injections of alprostadil , intraurethral suppositories of
alprostadil , and oral phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors. Because of the efficacy, ease of use, and safety of
PDE-5 inhibitors, these drugs are first-line therapy for ED.
1584
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1585 ---

A.  Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors
Four PDE-5 inhibitors sildenafil  [sil-DEN-a-fil], vardenafil  [var-DEN-na-fil], tadalafil  [ta-DAL-a-fil], and avanafil
[a-VAN-a-fil] are approved for the treatment of ED. [Note: Sildenafil  and tadalafil  are also indicated to treat
pulmonary hypertension, although the dosage regimen differs for this indication.] All four PDE-5 inhibitors are
equally effective in treating ED, and the adverse effect profiles of the drugs are similar. However, these agents differ
in the duration of action and the effects of food on drug absorption.
1.  Mechanism of action
Sexual stimulation results in smooth muscle relaxation of the corpus cavernosum, increasing the inflow of blood
(Figure 41.2). The mediator of this response is nitric oxide (NO). NO activates guanylyl cyclase, which forms cyclic
guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) from guanosine triphosphate. cGMP produces smooth muscle relaxation through
a reduction in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. The duration of action of cyclic nucleotides is controlled by the
action of PDE. At least 11 isozymes of PDE have been characterized. Sildenafil , vardenafil , tadalafil , and avanafil
inhibit PDE-5, the isozyme responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. The action of PDE-5
inhibitors is to increase the flow of blood into the corpus cavernosum at any given level of sexual stimulation. At
recommended doses, PDE-5 inhibitors have no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.
Figure 41.2 Mechanism of penile erection. cGMP = cyclic guanosine monophosphate.
2.  Pharmacokinetics
Sildenafil  and vardenafil  have similar pharmacokinetic properties. Both drugs should be taken approximately 1 hour
prior to anticipated sexual activity, with erectile enhancement observed for up to 4 hours after administration. Thus,
administration of sildenafil  and vardenafil  must be timed appropriately with regard to anticipated sexual activity.
The absorption of both drugs is delayed by consumption of a high-fat meal. Vardenafil  is also available in an orally
disintegrating tablet (ODT) formulation, which is not affected by a high-fat meal. However, the bioavailability of the
ODT formulation may be decreased by water, and therefore, the ODT should be placed under the tongue and not
administered with liquids. The vardenafil  ODT provides a higher systemic bioavailability than the vardenafil  film-
coated oral tablet, and these products are not interchangeable. Tadalafil  has a slower onset of action ( Figure 41.3)
than sildenafil  and vardenafil , but a significantly longer half-life of approximately 18 hours. As such, it is approved
for once-daily dosing (in addition to as-needed dosing). This results in enhanced erectile function for up to 36 hours.
Furthermore, the absorption of tadalafil  is not clinically influenced by food. The timing of sexual activity is less
critical for tadalafil  because of its prolonged duration of effect. Of all the PDE-5 inhibitors, avanafil  has the quickest
onset of action. It should be taken 30 minutes prior to sexual activity. All PDE-5 inhibitors are metabolized by the
cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) isoenzyme. Dosage adjustments for sildenafil , tadalafil , and vardenafil  are
recommended in patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction. PDE-5 inhibitors should be avoided in patients
with severe hepatic impairment. For patients with severe renal dysfunction, the dose of sildenafil  and tadalafil
should be reduced, and daily-dose tadalafil  and as needed avanafil  are contraindicated in these patients.

peak drug concentration when taken with high-fat foods.
3.  Adverse effects
The most frequent adverse effects of the PDE-5 inhibitors are headache, flushing, dyspepsia, and nasal congestion.
These effects are generally mild, and men with ED rarely discontinue treatment because of side effects. Disturbances
in color vision (loss of blue/green discrimination) may occur with PDE-5 inhibitors, likely due to inhibition of PDE-
6 (a PDE found in the retina that is important in color vision). Tadalafil , however, does not appear to disrupt PDE-6,
and reports of changes in color vision have been rare with this medication. The incidence of these reactions appears
to be dose dependent. Sudden hearing loss has also been reported with the use of PDE-5 inhibitors, perhaps due to
changes in sinus pressure because of vasodilation. Tadalafil  has been associated with back pain and myalgias, likely
because of inhibition of PDE-11, an enzyme found in skeletal muscle. There is an inherent cardiac risk associated
with sexual activity. Therefore, PDE-5 inhibitors should be used with caution in patients with a history of
cardiovascular disease or those with strong risk factors for cardiovascular disease. PDE-5 inhibitors should not be
used more than once per day for the treatment of ED. All of the PDE-5 inhibitors have the potential to cause
priapism (a painful, prolonged erection). Although this is a rare side effect, it is a medical emergency.1586
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1587 ---

4.  Drug interactions
Because of the ability of PDE-5 inhibitors to potentiate the hypotensive activity of NO, administration of these
medications in combination with organic nitrates (for example, nitroglycerin products, isosorbide dinitrate, or
isosorbide mononitrate) is contraindicated. PDE-5 inhibitors may produce additive blood pressure–lowering effects
when used in patients taking α-adrenergic antagonists for treatment of hypertension and/or alleviation of symptoms
associated with BPH. The combination of PDE-5 inhibitors and α-adrenergic antagonists should be used with
caution. Patients should be on a stable dose of the α-adrenergic antagonist prior to the initiation of the PDE-5
inhibitor, and the PDE-5 inhibitor should be started at a low dose if this combination is used. Doses of PDE-5
inhibitors may need to be reduced in the presence of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as clarithromycin, ritonavir,
and other protease inhibitors. Because of QT prolongation, the combination of vardenafil  and dronedarone should
be avoided.

B.  Alprostadil
Alprostadil  [al-PRAHST-uh-dill] is synthetic prostaglandin E1 (PGE1). In the penile tissue, PGE1 allows for
relaxation of the smooth muscle in the corpus cavernosum. Alprostadil  is available as an intraurethral suppository
and an injectable formulation. Although PDE-5 inhibitors are considered first-line therapy for the treatment of ED,
alprostadil  may be used for patients who are not candidates for oral therapies. In contrast to oral agents, alprostadil
acts locally, which may reduce the occurrence of adverse effects.
1.  Mechanism of action
Alprostadil  causes smooth muscle relaxation by an unknown mechanism. It is believed that alprostadil  increases
concentrations of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) within cavernosal tissue. As a result, protein kinase is
activated, allowing trabecular smooth muscle relaxation and dilation of cavernosal arteries. Increased blood flow to
the erection chamber compresses venous outflow, so that blood is entrapped and erection may occur.
2.  Pharmacokinetics
Systemic absorption of alprostadil  is minimal. If any alprostadil  is systemically absorbed, it is quickly metabolized.
The onset of action of alprostadil  is 5 to 10 minutes when given as a urethral suppository and 2 to 25 minutes when
administered by injection. The resulting erection may last for 30 to 60 minutes, or longer, depending upon the
particular patient.
3.  Adverse effects
Since alprostadil  is not systemically absorbed, adverse systemic effects are rare. However, hypotension or headache
is a possibility due to PGE1-induced vasodilation. Locally, adverse effects of alprostadil  include penile pain,
urethral pain, and testicular pain. Bleeding from the insertion or injection of alprostadil  is rare. Hematoma,
ecchymosis, and rash are possible from alprostadil  injection, although these adverse effects are also rare. Alprostadil
administration may lead to priapism.

III.  Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia
Three classes of medications are used to treat BPH: α1-adrenergic antagonists, 5-α reductase inhibitors, and PDE-5
inhibitors.
1589
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1590 ---

A.  α1-Adrenergic antagonists
Terazosin [ter-AY-zoe-sin], doxazosin [dox-AY-zoe-sin], tamsulosin [tam-SUE-loh-sin], alfuzosin [al-FUE-zoe-
sin], and silodosin [sil-oh-DOE-sin] are selective competitive blockers of the α1 receptor. All five agents are
indicated for the treatment of BPH (Figure 41.1). Prazosin is an α-blocker that is used off-label in the treatment of
BPH. However, current guidelines do not endorse the use of prazosin for BPH. Please refer to Chapter 7 for a
discussion of α-blockers in the setting of hypertension.
1.  Mechanism of action
α1A receptors are found in the prostate, α1B receptors are found in the prostate and vasculature, and α1D receptors are
found in the vasculature. By blocking the α1A and α1B receptors in the prostate, the α-blockers cause prostatic
smooth muscle relaxation, which leads to improved urine flow. Doxazosin, terazosin, and alfuzosin block α1A and
α1B receptors, whereas tamsulosin and silodosin are more selective for the α1A receptor. Because doxazosin,
terazosin, and alfuzosin block α1B receptors, these agents decrease peripheral vascular resistance and lower arterial
blood pressure by causing relaxation of both arterial and venous smooth muscle. In contrast, tamsulosin and
silodosin have less of an effect on blood pressure because they are more selective for the prostate-specific α1A
receptor.
2.  Pharmacokinetics
The α-blockers are well absorbed following oral administration. When taken with food, the absorption of
tamsulosin, alfuzosin, and silodosin is increased. Therefore, for best efficacy, these agents should be taken with food
or after a meal, typically supper. Doxazosin, alfuzosin, tamsulosin, and silodosin are metabolized through the
cytochrome P450 system. Silodosin is also a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Terazosin is metabolized in the
liver, but not through the CYP system. In general, the α-blockers have a half-life of 8 to 22 hours, with peak effects
1 to 4 hours after administration. Silodosin requires dosage adjustment in renal impairment and is contraindicated in
patients with severe renal dysfunction.
3.  Adverse effects
α-Blockers may cause dizziness, a lack of energy, nasal congestion, headache, drowsiness, and orthostatic
hypotension. Because tamsulosin and silodosin are more selective for the α1A receptors found on the smooth muscle
of the prostate, they have relatively minimal effects on blood pressure, although dizziness and orthostasis may occur.
By blocking α receptors in the ejaculatory ducts and impairing smooth muscle contraction, inhibition of ejaculation
and retrograde ejaculation have been reported. Several of these agents have a caution about “floppy iris syndrome,”
a condition in which the iris billows in response to intraoperative eye surgery (Figure 41.4).
1590

--- PAGE 1591 ---

Figure 41.4 Some adverse effects commonly observed with nonselective α-blockers.
4.  Drug interactions
Drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 (for example, verapamil , diltiazem) may increase the plasma
concentrations of doxazosin, alfuzosin, tamsulosin, and silodosin, whereas drugs that induce the CYP450 system (for
1591
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1592 ---

example, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John's wort ) may decrease plasma concentrations. Alfuzosin may
prolong the QT interval, so it should be used with caution with other drugs that cause QT prolongation (for example,
class III antiarrhythmics). Because silodosin is a substrate for P-gp, drugs that inhibit P-gp, such as cyclosporine,
may increase silodosin concentrations.

B.  5-α Reductase inhibitors
Finasteride [fin-AS-ter-ide] and dutasteride [doo-TAS-ter-ride] inhibit 5-α reductase. Compared to the α-blockers,
which provide patients with relief from BPH symptoms within 7 to 10 days, these agents may take up to 12 months
to relieve symptoms.
1.  Mechanism of action
Both finasteride and dutasteride inhibit the enzyme 5-α reductase, which is responsible for converting testosterone
to the more active dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is an androgen that stimulates prostate growth. By reducing
DHT, the prostate shrinks and urine flow improves. Compared with finasteride, dutasteride is more potent and
causes a greater decrease in DHT. In order for the 5-α reductase inhibitors to be effective, the prostate must be
enlarged. Since it takes several months for 5-α reductase inhibitors to reduce the prostate size, it is appropriate to use
these agents in combination with an α-blocker to provide relief of symptoms. Dutasteride and tamsulosin are
available as a combination product for this indication. Figures 41.5 and 41.6 summarize important differences
between these two classes of agents. Finasteride and dutasteride are also used for alopecia, since a reduction in
scalp and serum DHT prevents hair loss.
Figure 41.5 Therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).
Figure 41.6 Comparisons of treatment for BPH. PSA = prostate-specific antigen.
2.  Pharmacokinetics
Food does not affect the absorption of finasteride or dutasteride. Both agents are highly protein bound and
metabolized by the CYP450 system. The mean plasma elimination half-life of finasteride is 6 to 16 hours, while the
terminal elimination half-life of dutasteride is 5 weeks once steady-state concentrations are achieved (which is
typically after 6 months of therapy).
3.  Adverse effects
The 5-α reductase inhibitors cause sexual side effects, such as decreased ejaculate, decreased libido, ED,
gynecomastia, and oligospermia. Finasteride and dutasteride are teratogenic. Women who are pregnant or of
childbearing age should not handle or ingest either agent, as this may lead to serious birth defects involving the
genitalia in a male fetus. Although both agents are metabolized by the CYP450 system, drug interactions are rare. It
is not ideal to use a 5-α reductase inhibitor with testosterone, since both finasteride and dutasteride inhibit the
conversion of testosterone to its active form, DHT.1593

C.  Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor
Tadalafil  is the only PDE-5 inhibitor approved for the treatment of BPH. PDE-5 is present in the prostate and
bladder. As such, inhibition of PDE-5 by tadalafil  allows for vasodilation and relaxation of the smooth muscle of the
prostate and bladder, which thereby improves symptoms of BPH.

41.6Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
Which is CORRECT regarding the mechanism of action of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors?
A.  PDE-5 inhibitors increase prostaglandin production.
B.  PDE-5 inhibitors enhance the effect of nitric oxide.
C.  PDE-5 inhibitors cause vasoconstriction of the erection chamber.
D.  PDE-5 inhibitors antagonize cyclic GMP.
Correct answer = B. PDE-5 inhibitors enhance the effect of nitric oxide by preventing the breakdown of cGMP.
PDE-5 inhibitors do not affect prostaglandin production. Although blood is drawn to the erection chamber, PDE-
5 inhibitors allow for this via vasodilation, not vasoconstriction. PDE-5 inhibitors prevent the breakdown of
cGMP but do not antagonize its action.
When selecting between the available PDE-5 inhibitors for treatment of ED, which is an important
consideration?
A.  Tadalafil has the shortest half-life of the PDE-5 inhibitors.
B.  Sildenafil should be given with food to increase absorption.
C.  Vardenafil ODT doses are not equal to film-coated vardenafil doses.
D.  Avanafil should be taken at least 1 hour before intercourse.
Correct answer = C. The ODT dosage form of vardenafil provides a high systemic concentration of vardenafil,
which is higher than that provided by the film-coated tablets. As such, the doses are not interchangeable. Tadalafil
has the longest half-life of all PDE-5 inhibitors. Food may delay sildenafil absorption. Avanafil has the quickest
onset of action and may be taken 30 minutes before intercourse.
A patient who is taking a PDE-5 inhibitor for ED is diagnosed with angina. Which antianginal medication
would be of particular concern in this patient?
A.  Metoprolol
B.  Diltiazem
C.  Amlodipine
D.  Nitroglycerin
Correct answer = D. Nitrates, such as nitroglycerin, can cause life-threatening hypotension when taken with PDE-
5 inhibitors. While metoprolol, diltiazem, and amlodipine may all lower blood pressure, the interaction with PDE-
5 inhibitors is not relevant.
Which BEST describes the mechanism of action of alprostadil?
A.  Alprostadil blocks cGMP.
B.  Alprostadil blocks nitric oxide.
C.  Alprostadil increases PDE-5.
D.  Alprostadil increases cAMP.
Correct answer = D. Through an unknown mechanism, alprostadil (a synthetic prostaglandin) increases levels of
cAMP, causing smooth muscle relaxation. Alprostadil does not affect cGMP, nitric oxide, or PDE-5.
Which is CORRECT regarding local administration of alprostadil?
A.  Local administration of alprostadil allows for low systemic absorption.
B.  Local administration of alprostadil increases the chance of drug interactions.
C.  Local administration of alprostadil is accomplished by application of a cream.
D.  Local administration of alprostadil causes changes in color vision.
Correct answer = A. Local administration of alprostadil allows for minimal systemic absorption. This makes
alprostadil associated with few drug interactions. Alprostadil is administered by injection or urethral suppository,
not a cream. Because there is little systemic absorption, and alprostadil does not affect PDE-6, changes in color
vision are not likely.
Which is the BEST description of the mechanism of action of dutasteride?
A.  Dutasteride blocks 5-α reductase.
B.  Dutasteride blocks α1A receptors.
C.  Dutasteride blocks PDE-5.
D.  Dutasteride blocks α1A and α1B receptors.
Correct answer = A. Dutasteride blocks 5-α reductase. Dutasteride does not affect α1A receptors, α1B receptors, or
PDE-5.1596

41.10A patient is worried about starting terazosin because he is very sensitive to side effects of medications.
Which adverse effect would be most expected in this patient?
A.  Erectile dysfunction
B.  Gynecomastia
C.  Dizziness
D.  Vomiting
Correct answer = C. Because of the α-blocking properties, terazosin commonly causes dizziness (this may be
related to orthostatic hypotension). ED and gynecomastia would be unexpected with α-blockers. While most any
drug may cause nausea and vomiting, terazosin is much more likely to cause dizziness.
Which describes an important difference between terazosin and tamsulosin?
A.  Terazosin blocks α1A receptors, whereas tamsulosin blocks α1A and α1B receptors.
B.  Terazosin blocks α1A and α1B receptors, whereas tamsulosin blocks α1A receptors.
C.  Terazosin blocks 5-α reductase, whereas tamsulosin blocks PDE-5.
D.  Terazosin must be taken with food, whereas tamsulosin can be taken on an empty stomach.
Correct answer = B. Tamsulosin is more selective for the α1A receptor, found in the prostate. Terazosin blocks
α1A; however, terazosin also blocks α1B. Neither one blocks 5-α reductase nor PDE-5. Tamsulosin should be
taken with food, while terazosin does not need to be taken with food.
Which is CORRECT regarding finasteride?
A.  Finasteride is associated with significant hypotension.
B.  Finasteride is associated with birth defects.
C.  Finasteride is effective within 2 weeks of initiation.
D.  Finasteride is renally eliminated.
Correct answer = B. Because finasteride inhibits the conversion of testosterone to its active form, it may cause
significant developmental defects in the male genitalia of a developing fetus. As such, it is contraindicated in
pregnancy. Unlike the α-blockers, the 5-α reductase inhibitors are not associated with hypotension. Finasteride
may take up to 12 months before it is effective. Finasteride is metabolized via CYP450 and is not renally
eliminated.
A 70-year-old man with BPH and an enlarged prostate continues to have urinary symptoms after an adequate
trial of tamsulosin. Dutasteride is added to his therapy. In addition to tamsulosin, he is also taking
hydrochlorothiazide, testosterone, and vardenafil as needed before intercourse. Which of his medications
could have an interaction with dutasteride?
A.  Hydrochlorothiazide
B.  Tamsulosin
C.  Testosterone
D.  Vardenafil
Correct answer = C. Because dutasteride prevents the conversion of testosterone to the more active form, DHT,
these medications have an interaction. Essentially, dutasteride prevents testosterone from “working.”
Hydrochlorothiazide does not interfere with the metabolism of dutasteride, and dutasteride does not have any
effect on the blood pressure–lowering effects of hydrochlorothiazide. Tamsulosin is appropriate in combination
with a 5-α reductase inhibitor when the prostate is enlarged. Vardenafil is only prescribed as needed, and the two
drugs do not have a pharmacokinetic interaction.1597

Drugs for Anemia
Lori Dupree

--- PAGE 1599 ---

I.  Overview
Anemia is defined as a below-normal plasma hemoglobin concentration resulting from a decreased number of
circulating red blood cells or an abnormally low total hemoglobin content per unit of blood volume. General signs
and symptoms of anemia include fatigue, palpitations, shortness of breath, pallor, dizziness, and insomnia. Anemia
can be caused by chronic blood loss, bone marrow abnormalities, hemolysis, infections, malignancy, endocrine
deficiencies, renal failure, and a number of other disease states. A large number of drugs cause toxic effects on
blood cells, hemoglobin production, or erythropoietic organs, which, in turn, may cause anemia. Nutritional anemias
are caused by dietary deficiencies of substances such as iron, folic acid, and vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) that are
necessary for normal erythropoiesis. Individuals with a genetic predisposition to anemia, such as sickle cell disease,
can benefit from pharmacologic treatment with actions beyond nutritional supplementation, such as hydroxyurea.
Anemia can be temporarily corrected by transfusion of whole blood. A summary of agents used for the treatment of
anemias is provided in Figure 42.1.

--- PAGE 1601 ---

A.  Iron
Iron is stored in the intestinal mucosal cells, liver, spleen, and bone marrow as ferritin (an iron–protein complex) and
delivered to the marrow for hemoglobin production by transferrin, a transport protein. Iron deficiency, the most
common nutritional deficiency, results from a negative iron balance due to depletion of iron stores and/or inadequate
intake, such as acute or chronic blood loss, menstruating or pregnant women, or periods of accelerated growth in
children. In addition to general signs and symptoms of anemia, iron deficiency anemia may cause pica (hunger for
ice, dirt, paper, etc.), koilonychias (upward curvature of the finger and toe nails), and soreness and cracking at the
corners of the mouth.
1.  Mechanism of action
Supplementation with elemental iron corrects the iron deficiency. The CDC recommends 150 to 180 mg/day of oral
elemental iron administered in divided doses two to three times daily for patients with iron deficiency anemia.
2.  Pharmacokinetics
Iron is absorbed after oral administration. Acidic conditions in the stomach keep iron in the reduced ferrous form,
which is the more soluble form. Iron is then absorbed in the duodenum. [Note: The amount absorbed depends on the
current body stores of iron. If iron stores are adequate, less iron is absorbed. If stores are low, more iron is
absorbed.] The relative percentage of iron absorbed decreases with increasing doses. Oral preparations include
ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, ferrous gluconate, polysaccharide–iron complex, and carbonyl iron formulations.
The percentage of elemental iron varies in each oral iron preparation (Figure 42.2). Parenteral formulations of iron,
such as iron dextran, sodium ferric gluconate, ferumoxytol , ferric carboxymaltose, and iron sucrose, are also
available. While parenteral administration treats iron deficiency rapidly, oral administration may take several weeks.
Figure 42.2 Characteristics of various iron formulations.
3.  Adverse effects
Gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances caused by local irritation (abdominal pain, constipation, nausea, diarrhea) and
dark stools are the most common adverse effects of oral iron supplements. Parenteral iron formulations may be used
in those who cannot tolerate or inadequately absorb oral iron, as well as those receiving erythropoietin with
hemodialysis or chemotherapy. Fatal hypersensitivity and anaphylactoid reactions can occur in patients receiving
parenteral iron (mainly iron dextran formulations). A test dose should be administered prior to iron dextran. In
addition, intravenous iron should be used cautiously in the presence of active infections. [Note: Iron is essential for
bacterial growth.]

B.  Folic acid (folate)
The primary use of folic acid is in treating deficiency states that arise from inadequate levels of the vitamin. Folate
deficiency may be caused by 1) increased demand (for example, pregnancy and lactation), 2) poor absorption caused
by pathology of the small intestine, 3) alcoholism, or 4) treatment with drugs that are dihydrofolate reductase
inhibitors (for example, methotrexate and trimethoprim), drugs that directly inhibit DNA synthesis (for example,
azathioprine and zidovudine), or drugs that reduce folate absorption (for example, phenytoin and phenobarbital ). A
primary result of folic acid deficiency is megaloblastic anemia (large-sized red blood cells), which is caused by
diminished synthesis of purines and pyrimidines. This leads to an inability of erythropoietic tissue to make DNA
and, thereby, proliferate ( Figure 42.3). [Note: To avoid neurological complications of vitamin B12 deficiency, it is
important to evaluate the basis of the megaloblastic anemia prior to instituting therapy. Both vitamin B12 and folate
deficiency can cause similar symptoms.]

Figure 42.3 Causes and consequences of folic acid depletion.
Folic acid is rapidly absorbed in the jejunum unless abnormal pathology is present. Oral folic acid administration is
nontoxic and at high doses, excess vitamin is excreted in the urine. Rare hypersensitivity reactions to parenteral
injections have been reported.

--- PAGE 1605 ---

C.  Cyanocobalamin and hydroxocobalamin (vitamin B 12)
Deficiencies of vitamin B12 can result from either low dietary levels or, more commonly, poor absorption of the
vitamin due to the failure of gastric parietal cells to produce intrinsic factor (as in pernicious anemia), or a loss of
activity of the receptor needed for intestinal uptake of the vitamin. Nonspecific malabsorption syndromes or gastric
resection can also cause vitamin B12 deficiency. In addition to general signs and symptoms of anemia, vitamin B12
deficiency anemia may cause tingling (pins and needles) in the hands and feet, difficulty walking, dementia, and, in
extreme cases, hallucinations, paranoia, or schizophrenia. [Note: Folic acid administration alone reverses the
hematologic abnormality and, thus, masks the vitamin B12 deficiency, which can then proceed to severe neurologic
dysfunction and disease. The cause of megaloblastic anemia needs to be determined in order to be specific in terms
of treatment. Therefore, megaloblastic anemia should not be treated with folic acid alone but, rather, with a
combination of folic acid and vitamin B12.]
The vitamin may be administered orally (for dietary deficiencies), intramuscularly, or deep subcutaneously (for
pernicious anemia). Intramuscular hydroxocobalamin [hye-drox-oh-koe-BAL-a-min] is preferred since it has a rapid
response, is highly protein bound, and maintains longer plasma levels. In patients with malabsorption, such as in
bariatric surgery (surgical treatment for obesity), vitamin B12 supplementation as cyanocobalamin [sye-an-oh-koe-
BAL-a-min] is required daily in high oral doses or monthly by the parenteral route. This vitamin is nontoxic even in
large doses. In pernicious anemia, therapy must be continued for life.

D.  Erythropoietin and darbepoetin
Peritubular cells in the kidneys respond to hypoxia and synthesize and release erythropoietin [ee-rith-ro-POI-eh-tin;
EPO], a glycoprotein. EPO stimulates stem cells to differentiate into proerythroblasts and promotes the release of
reticulocytes from the marrow and initiation of hemoglobin formation. Thus, EPO regulates red blood cell
proliferation and differentiation in bone marrow. Human erythropoietin (epoetin alfa), produced by recombinant
DNA technology, is effective in the treatment of anemia caused by end-stage renal disease, human
immunodeficiency virus infection, bone marrow disorders, prematurity, and malignancy. A long-acting form of
erythropoietin, darbepoetin [dar-be-POE-e-tin], has a half-life about three times that of epoetin alfa due to the
addition of two carbohydrate chains. These agents are well tolerated and are administered intravenously in renal
dialysis patients or subcutaneously for other indications. Side effects such as blood pressure elevation and arthralgia
may occur in some cases. [Note: The former may be due to increases in peripheral vascular resistance and/or blood
viscosity.] In addition, iron supplementation may be required to ensure an adequate response.
When epoetin alfa is used to target hemoglobin concentrations over 11 g/dL, serious cardiovascular events (such
as thrombosis and severe hypertension), increased risk of death, shortened time to tumor progression, and decreased
survival have been observed. The recommendations for all patients receiving epoetin alfa or darbepoetin include a
minimum effective dose that does not exceed a hemoglobin level of 12 g/dL, and a hemoglobin level that does not
rise by more than 1 g/dL over a 2-week period. Additionally, if the hemoglobin level exceeds 10 g/dL, doses of
epoetin alfa or darbepoetin should be reduced or treatment should be discontinued. Neither agent has any value in
the acute treatment of anemia due to their delayed onset of action.

III.  Agents Used to Treat Neutropenia
Myeloid growth factors or granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF), such as filgrastim [fil-GRAS-tim], tbo-
filgrastim, and pegfilgrastim [peg-fil-GRAS-tim], and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors (GM-
CSF), such as sargramostim [sar-GRA-moe-stim], stimulate granulocyte production in the marrow to increase
neutrophil counts and reduce the duration of severe neutropenia. These agents are typically used prophylactically to
reduce the risk of neutropenia following chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation. Filgrastim and
sargramostim can be dosed either subcutaneously or intravenously, whereas tbo-filgrastim and pegfilgrastim are
dosed subcutaneously only. The main difference between the available agents is in the frequency of dosing.
Filgrastim, tbo-filgrastim, and sargramostim are dosed once a day beginning 24 to 72 hours after chemotherapy,
until the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) reaches 5000 to 10,000/μL. Pegfilgrastim is a pegylated form of G-CSF,
resulting in a longer half-life when compared to the other agents, and is administered 24 hours after chemotherapy,
as a single dose, rather than once daily. Monitoring of ANC is typically not necessary with pegfilgrastim. There is
no evidence to show superiority of one agent over another in terms of efficacy, safety, or tolerability. Bone pain is a
common adverse effect with these agents.

IV.  Agents Used to Treat Sickle Cell Disease
1608
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1609 ---

A.  Hydroxyurea
Hydroxyurea [hye-DROX-ee-yoo-ree-ah] is an oral ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor that can reduce the frequency
of painful sickle cell crises ( Figure 42.4). In sickle cell disease, hydroxyurea increases fetal hemoglobin (HbF)
levels, thus diluting the abnormal hemoglobin S (HbS). Polymerization of HbS is delayed and reduced in treated
patients, so that painful crises are not caused by sickled cells blocking capillaries and causing tissue anoxia. A
clinical response may take three to six months. Important side effects of hydroxyurea include bone marrow
suppression and cutaneous vasculitis. It is important that hydroxyurea is administered under the supervision of a
provider experienced in the treatment of sickle cell disease. Hydroxyurea is also used off-label to treat acute
myelogenous leukemia, psoriasis, and polycythemia vera.

experiencing first painful episode.

42.6Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
Which is an appropriate treatment for a nutritional anemia that presents as a hunger for ice and/or upward
curvature of the fingernails?
A.  Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin)
B.  Folic acid
C.  Vitamin D
D.  Iron
Correct answer = D. Vitamin B12, folic acid, and iron deficiencies all contribute to anemia, but iron deficiency is
associated with pica (hunger for ice or dirt) and koilonychias (upward curvature of toenails/fingernails). Vitamin
D deficiency does exist but does not cause anemia.
Which iron supplement contains the highest percentage of elemental iron?
A.  Ferrous sulfate
B.  Carbonyl iron
C.  Ferrous gluconate
D.  Ferric ammonium citrate
Correct answer = B. Ferrous sulfate contains 20% (or 30% in the anhydrous formulation), ferrous gluconate
contains 12%, and ferric ammonium citrate contains 18% of elemental iron. These are all well below the percent
of elemental iron in carbonyl iron, which contains 100% elemental iron.
A 56-year-old woman is discovered to have megaloblastic anemia. Her past medical history is significant for
alcoholism. Which would be the best treatment option for this patient?
A.  Oral vitamin B12
B.  Parenteral vitamin B12
C.  Oral folic acid
D.  Oral vitamin B12 with oral folic acid
Correct answer = D. The patient has a history of alcoholism, which would suggest folic acid deficiency anemia.
However, folic acid administration alone reverses the hematologic abnormality and masks possible vitamin B12
deficiency, which can then proceed to severe neurologic dysfunction and disease. The cause of megaloblastic
anemia needs to be determined in order to be specific in terms of treatment. Therefore, megaloblastic anemia
should not be treated with folic acid alone but, rather, with a combination of folic acid and vitamin B12.
A 60-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician complaining of dizziness and fatigue.
Following laboratory testing, the patient is diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia, and oral iron
supplementation is needed. Which would be the most appropriate dosing regimen for the patient?
A.  Ferrous fumarate 325 mg once daily
B.  Ferrous gluconate 256 mg once daily
C.  Polysaccharide–iron complex 150 mg two to three times daily
D.  Ferrous sulfate 325 mg two to three times daily
Correct answer = D. The recommended dose of iron supplementation in iron deficiency anemia is typically about
150 mg of elemental iron in two to three divided doses. Extended-release formulations (such as polysaccharide–
iron complex) may be dosed once daily. Ferrous sulfate 325 mg contains approximately 65 mg of elemental iron,
ferrous fumarate 325 mg contains about 107 mg elemental iron, ferrous gluconate 256 mg contains approximately
30 mg elemental iron, and polysaccharide–iron complex 150 mg contains 150 mg elemental iron.
A 63-year-old female patient with anemia secondary to chronic kidney disease and a hemoglobin level of 8.6
g/dL is treated with epoetin alfa. Eight days after the initial dose of epoetin alfa, the patient’s hemoglobin is
10.5 g/dL. Which would be the next step in the management of this patient’s anemia?
A.  Discontinue epoetin alfa
B.  Discontinue epoetin alfa and initiate darbepoetin
C.  Continue epoetin alfa
D.  Increase the dose of epoetin alfa
Correct answer = A. Hemoglobin has increased to more than 10 g/dL and more than 1 g/dL in 2 weeks, so epoetin
alfa should be discontinued or the dose reduced. Switching to darbepoetin, continuing epoetin alfa, or increasing
the dose of epoetin alfa would continue to increase hemoglobin and lead to increased risk of cardiovascular
events.
Which drug would be beneficial to reduce the frequency of painful crises in a patient with sickle cell
disease?1611

--- PAGE 1612 ---

42.7
42.8
42.9
42.10A.  Epoetin alfa
B.  Filgrastim
C.  Hydroxyurea
D.  Sargramostim
Correct answer = C. Clinical evidence supports the use of hydroxyurea for reducing the frequency and severity of
painful sickle cell crises during the course of sickle cell disease. Epoetin alfa helps increase hemoglobin and red
blood cell production in anemias secondary to chronic kidney disease, HIV, bone marrow disorders, and other
disorders. Filgrastim and sargramostim stimulate granulocyte production in the marrow to increase the neutrophil
counts and reduce the duration of severe neutropenia.
After completing his last cycle of chemotherapy, a 68-year-old man received a dose of pegfilgrastim
prophylactically to reduce his risk of neutropenia. Twenty-four hours later, he returned to clinic to receive an
additional dose of pegfilgrastim and was told he did not need another dose. Which would explain the
rationale behind this recommendation?
A.  Absolute neutrophil count is above 1000/μL
B.  Pegfilgrastim is given as single dose
C.  Next dose of pegfilgrastim is due 72 hours after the first dose
D.  Next dose of pegfilgrastim is due 48 hours after the first dose
Correct answer = B. Pegfilgrastim is a pegylated form of G-CSF and has a longer half-life; therefore, it is
administered as a single dose with no additional doses needed. Monitoring of the ANC is not necessary with
pegfilgrastim due to the pharmacokinetics of the drug.
A patient has been taking ferrous sulfate 325 mg twice daily for two weeks and is complaining of a bad taste
after each dose. Which once-daily, oral iron formulations would improve tolerability and provide a similar
total daily dose of elemental iron as twice-daily ferrous sulfate?
A.  Ferric ammonium citrate 25 mg
B.  Ferrous gluconate 100 mg
C.  Ferrous sulfate, anhydrous 142 mg
D.  Polysaccharide–iron complex 150 mg
Correct answer = D. Once-daily polysaccharide–iron complex (150 mg = 150 mg elemental iron) is tasteless and
odorless, with a similar total daily dose of elemental iron as ferrous sulfate 325 mg twice daily (130 mg elemental
iron/day). Once-daily ferric ammonium citrate 25 mg (4.5 mg elemental iron) is less bioavailable than twice-daily
ferrous sulfate. Ferrous sulfate and ferrous gluconate have similar tolerability, but once-daily ferrous gluconate
has less elemental iron (12 mg elemental iron). Ferrous sulfate, anhydrous has better tolerability with the
extended-release formulation, but has less elemental iron (43 mg elemental iron) administered once daily
compared to twice daily ferrous sulfate.
Which patient with iron deficiency anemia would need the parenteral form of iron replacement?
A.  22-year-old woman with heavy menstrual periods
B.  58-year-old man with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis
C.  32-year-old woman in the first trimester of pregnancy
D.  40-year-old man with a diabetic foot infection
Correct answer = B. Clinical evidence supports the use of parenteral iron over oral iron in hemodialysis patients
due to a significantly greater increase in hemoglobin levels and lower incidence of treatment-related adverse
events. Parenteral iron is also preferred in patients who cannot tolerate oral iron or who have iron malabsorption.
Patients with heavy menstrual periods, who are pregnant, or who have chronic disease states, such as diabetes,
and infections, should be administered an initial trial of oral iron.
An 81-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with progressive weakness, fatigue, confusion,
and reports of seeing people in her house who were trying to hurt her but who were not physically present.
Her physical exam was positive for pallor but negative for koilonychias or cracking at the corners of the
mouth. Which deficiency would be the highest priority in this patient’s workup?
A.  Vitamin B12
B.  Iron
C.  Folate
D.  Calcium
Correct answer = A. Based on the presentation of confusion and hallucinations, vitamin B12 deficiency should be
considered the highest priority. Second priority would be to assess folate deficiency, since symptoms are similar
to vitamin B12 deficiency. Iron would be the third priority due to the patient’s age, even without the presence of
koilonychias or cracking of the mouth. Last priority would be to assess age-related deficiencies in calcium, which
could lead to fatigue as well as muscle cramps, poor appetite, and abnormal heart rhythms.1612

Drugs for Dermatologic Disorders

--- PAGE 1615 ---

I.  Overview
The skin is a complex and dynamic organ comprised of cells, tissues, and biomolecules that coordinate to provide
many interdependent functions, including protection from environmental insults from noxious chemicals, infectious
pathogens, and ultraviolet radiation, as well as serving vital functions in wound repair, sensation, thermoregulation,
and vitamin D synthesis. This chapter focuses on drugs that are used for some of the more common skin conditions
including psoriasis, acne, rosacea, infections, pigmentation disorders, and alopecia. Drugs for acne, superficial
bacterial infections, and rosacea are summarized in Figure 43.1. [Note: Agents for fungal infections of the skin are
covered in the chapter on antifungals (see Chapter 33).]

--- PAGE 1617 ---

II.  Topical Preparations
The skin is composed of two main layers, the epidermis and the dermis (Figure 43.2). The epidermis is composed of
several layers of keratinocytes, with the outermost layer, the stratum corneum, serving as the primary barrier to
external insults. The dermis, located between the epidermis and the subcutaneous tissue, is composed of connective
tissue and contains many specialized structures, such as sweat glands, sebaceous glands, hair follicles, and blood
vessels. Defects in skin structure and function induced by genetics and by environmental insults can lead to
numerous dermatological conditions, many of which can be controlled or cured with the use of drug therapy.
Figure 43.2 Cross section of the skin.
Use of topical agents for treatment of dermatologic disorders is not only convenient but also can minimize systemic
adverse effects. Common topical dosage forms include sprays, powders, lotions, creams, pastes, gels, ointments, and
foams. The choice of which dosage form to use for a particular condition involves factors such as occlusiveness,
ease of application, patient acceptance, and drug potency. The choice also includes consideration of stratum
corneum thickness and integrity, as well as the type, location, and extent of the lesions being treated.

--- PAGE 1618 ---

III.  Agents for Acne
Acne vulgaris (common acne) is a common skin disorder that occurs in about 85% of individuals 12 to 24 years of
age, coinciding with an increase in androgen production. [Note: Use of oral contraceptives may help decrease
circulating levels of free androgen and reduce symptoms of acne in females (see Chapter 25).] It begins with
excessive proliferation and adhesion of skin cells that form a keratin plug (microcomedone), which closes the hair
follicle (Figure 43.3). Within the closed hair follicle, skin cells are shed and sebum production continues. This
causes the follicle to dilate to form a comedone.
Figure 43.3 Acne vulgaris. A. Normal sebaceous gland and hair follicle. B. Comedone
formation. C. Pustule formation.
The sebum serves as a nutrient for the proliferation of Propionibacterium acnes , which along with other factors,
triggers an inflammatory response that causes the formation of a pustule or papule—the pimple. If this progresses,
the follicular wall can rupture, leading to the formation of an inflamed nodule. Different medications can be used
alone or in combination to affect one or more of these pathological components to clear the acne lesions.
1618
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1619 ---

A.  Antibiotics
Topical and oral antibiotics are commonly used in acne, with oral antibiotics reserved for moderate-to-severe acne.
The use of antibiotics in acne is based not only on their antibacterial effects but also on anti-inflammatory
properties, which can be significant for some antibiotics, such as the tetracyclines. The most common topical
antibiotics used are clindamycin [klin-da-MYE-sin] (solution or gel) and erythromycin [er-ITH-roe-MYE-sin]
(cream, gel, or lotion). The most common oral antibiotics used for acne are the tetracyclines, doxycycline [DOX-i-
SYE-kleen] and minocycline [mi-no-SYE-kleen], and the macrolides, erythromycin and azithromycin [a-ZITH-roe-
MYE-sin]. Topical forms tend to be well tolerated. For oral tetracyclines, common adverse effects are
gastrointestinal disturbances and photosensitivity, and for the macrolides, gastrointestinal disturbances are common.
The most significant concern in the use of both topical and oral antibiotics is the development of bacterial resistance.
Some measures that can be taken to limit the development of resistance include using antibiotics only in
combination with other acne agents, using oral antibiotics for the shortest time possible, and using low-dose oral
antibiotics (subantimicrobial dosing) when possible. Also, once acne lesions are clear, patients should follow with
topical maintenance therapy with effective nonantibiotic topical agents, such as benzoyl peroxide and the retinoids.
Antibiotics are covered in more detail in the chapters on anti-infective therapy (see Chapter 30).

--- PAGE 1620 ---

B.  Azelaic acid
Azelaic [aze-eh-LAY-ik] acid is a naturally occurring dicarboxylic acid that has antibacterial activity against P.
acnes  through its ability to inhibit protein synthesis. It also exhibits anti-inflammatory activity, inhibits the division
and differentiation of keratinocytes, and shows comedolytic activity. Azelaic acid exhibits a lightening effect on
hyperpigmented skin, which makes it useful in patients who experience dyspigmentation as a consequence of
inflammatory acne. It is available as a cream and a gel, and the major adverse effects are mild and transient pruritus,
burning, stinging and tingling.
1620
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1621 ---

C.  Benzoyl peroxide
Benzoyl peroxide [BEN-zoyl per-OX-ide] is a commonly used topical medication that improves acne primarily
through its bactericidal action, where its oxidizing activity is lethal for P. acnes . It shows no bacterial resistance. The
agent also reduces inflammation and has comedolytic activity. It is available in topical washes, foams, creams, and
gels. The major adverse effects are dry skin, irritation, and bleaching of bedding and clothing. It may also cause
contact dermatitis in some patients.
1621
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1622 ---

D.  Dapsone
Dapsone [DAP-sone] is a sulfone that exhibits both anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activity and is effective at
reducing inflammatory acne lesion counts, with some reduction in noninflammatory lesions as well. The anti-
inflammatory activity derives partly from its ability to interfere with neutrophilic function and to reduce the
production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) by mononuclear cells. Dapsone is available as a topical gel with the
most common adverse effects being transient oiliness, dryness, and erythema, which may be at least in part due to
the nondrug part of the formulation.
1622
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1623 ---

E.  Retinoids
Retinoids are vitamin A derivatives that interact with retinoid receptors to regulate gene expression in a manner that
normalizes keratinocyte differentiation and reduces hyperproliferation (giving them comedolytic activity). They also
reduce sebum production and inflammation. These diverse effects make retinoids useful for acne, as well as a
variety of other conditions, including psoriasis and severe rosacea. For acne vulgaris, the topical retinoids tretinoin
[TRET-i-no-in], adapalene [a-DAP-a-leen], and tazarotene [ta-ZAR-oh-teen] are used for mild and moderate forms,
whereas the oral retinoid isotretinoin [eye-so-TRET-i-no-in] is reserved for severe nodular forms of acne.
Adverse effects of the topical retinoids include erythema, desquamation, burning, and stinging. These effects
often decrease with time. Other potential adverse effects include dry mucous membranes and photosensitivity.
Patients should be cautioned to wear sunscreen. Though their systemic absorption is generally limited, use should be
avoided during pregnancy, particularly topical tazarotene, which is the most teratogenic of the three topical retinoids
for acne. Oral isotretinoin, used in severe acne, has potentially serious adverse effects including psychiatric effects
and birth defects. It is contraindicated in women who are pregnant or intend to become pregnant.

F.  Salicylic acid
Topical salicylic [sal-i-SIL-ik] acid, a β-hydroxy acid, penetrates the pilosebaceous unit and works as an exfoliant to
clear comedones. Its comedolytic effects are not as pronounced as those of the retinoids. The drug has mild anti-
inflammatory activity and is keratolytic at higher concentrations. Salicylic acid is used as a treatment for mild acne
and is available in many over-the-counter facial washes and medicated treatment pads. Mild skin peeling, dryness,
and local irritation are adverse effects.

--- PAGE 1625 ---

G.  Sulfacetamide sodium
Sulfacetamide sodium [SUL-fa-SET-a-mide SOE-dee-um] interferes with bacterial growth and is often combined
with sulfur, a keratolytic agent. The combination is used to treat inflammatory acne lesions when present. It is also
used to treat rosacea (see below). The product is available as cleanser, cream, foam, gel, lotion, pads, suspension,
and a wash. The most common adverse effects include contact dermatitis, erythema, pruritus, Stevens-Johnson
syndrome, and xeroderma.

IV.  Agents for Superficial Bacterial Infections
Several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria can cause various superficial skin infections, such as folliculitis
and impetigo, as well as deeper infections, such as erysipelas and cellulitis. In more severe cases, these infections
can lead to ulceration and systemic infections. This section covers topical antibacterial agents that can be used for
the treatment and prevention of certain superficial skin infections.
1626
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1627 ---

A.  Bacitracin
Bacitracin [bas-i-TRAY-sin] is a peptide antibiotic active against many gram-positive organisms. It is used mainly
in topical formulations; if used systemically, it is toxic. Bacitracin is mostly used for the prevention of skin
infections after burns or minor scrapes. It is frequently found in combination products with neomycin and/or
polymyxin (see below). It is available as an ointment.
1627
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1628 ---

B.  Gentamicin
Gentamicin [GEN-ta-MYE-sin] interferes with bacterial protein synthesis targeting gram-negative organisms. This
agent is often used in combination with other agents to treat skin infections caused by gram-negative organisms. It is
available as a cream and an ointment. Topical use of this agent rarely causes systemic side effects.
1628
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1629 ---

C.  Mupirocin
Mupirocin [mue-PIR-oh-sin] is a protein synthesis inhibitor targeting gram-positive organisms. It is useful in
treating impetigo (a contagious skin infection caused by streptococci or staphylococci; Figure 43.4) and other
serious gram-positive skin infections, including infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus . It
is available as a cream and an ointment. [Note: Intranasal mupirocin may be used to eradicate colonization with
methicillin-resistant S . aureus  and reduce the risk of infection in hospitalized patients.] The most common adverse
effects are pruritus, skin rash, and burning.

--- PAGE 1630 ---

D.  Neomycin
Neomycin [nee-oh-MY-sin] interferes with bacterial protein synthesis and is active primarily against gram-negative
organisms, with some activity against gram-positive organisms. This agent is often formulated with other topical
anti-infectives, such as bacitracin and polymyxin to treat skin infections. The combination is available as an
ointment. Common adverse effects associated with the combination agents include contact dermatitis, erythema,
rash, and urticaria.

E.  Polymyxin
Polymyxin [paw-lee-MIX-in] B is a cyclic hydrophobic peptide that disrupts the bacterial cell membrane of gram-
negative organisms. As noted above, it is commonly combined with bacitracin (“double antibiotic”) and neomycin
with bacitracin (“triple antibiotic”) in topical products used for the prevention of skin infections after minor skin
trauma. These combinations are available as ointments.

V.  Agents Used for Rosacea
Rosacea is a common inflammatory disorder affecting the central portion of facial skin. Common clinical features
include facial erythema (flushing) and inflammatory lesions that are similar to acne lesions. The signs, symptoms,
and severity determine the treatment for this disorder. Azelaic acid is one potential treatment for rosacea. Other
topical and oral products for rosacea are described below.

B.  Doxycycline
Doxycycline [DOX-i-SYE-kleen] is an antibacterial agent used orally at low doses, where it exerts its effects on
rosacea, not by killing bacteria, but rather through its anti-inflammatory effects. It is available as a capsule and
tablet, and its major adverse effects include diarrhea, nausea, dyspepsia, and nasopharyngitis.

C.  Metronidazole
Metronidazole [me-troe-NI-da-zole] is an antibacterial agent used topically for rosacea. It is believed to work in
rosacea through anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive effects, rather than through its antibacterial effects. It is
available as a cream, gel, and lotion, and its major adverse effects are burning, erythema, skin irritation, xeroderma,
and acne vulgaris.

VI.  Agents for Pigmentation Disorders
The color of skin is derived from melanin produced by melanocytes in the basal layer of the epidermis. When the
melanocytes are damaged, the melanin levels are affected, which ultimately leads to pigmentation disorders. If the
body does not make enough melanin, the skin gets lighter (hypopigmentation). If the body makes too much melanin,
the skin gets darker (hyperpigmentation). Pigmentation disorders can be widespread and affect many areas of the
skin or they can be localized. Agents used for pigmentation disorders are discussed below and summarized in Figure
43.5.

A.  Hydroquinone
Hydroquinone [HYE-droe-KWIN-one] is a topical skin-whitening agent that reduces hyperpigmentation associated
with freckles and melasma (brown to gray-brown patches on the skin; Figure 43.6). It is often used in combination
with topical retinoids to treat the signs of photoaging. The mechanism of action of hydroquinone is through
inhibition of the tyrosinase, an enzyme required for melanin synthesis. Hydroquinone lightens the skin temporarily
and is commonly used as a 4% preparation. It should not be used in higher concentrations, or in excessive quantities
for an extended duration, as it is associated with possible carcinogenicity. The most common adverse effect is local
skin irritation.

--- PAGE 1642 ---

B.  Methoxsalen
Methoxsalen [meth-OX-a-len] is a psoralen photoactive agent that stimulates melanocytes and is used as a
repigmentation agent for patients with vitiligo (Figure 43.7). It must be photoactivated by UV radiation to form a
DNA adduct inhibiting DNA replication by a method called PUVA (psoralen plus UVA radiation). Methoxsalen
inhibits cell proliferation and promotes cell differentiation of epithelial cells. Topical methoxsalen may be used for
small patches of vitiligo, and oral therapy is used for more widespread disease. Because of the possibilities for aging
of the skin and carcinogenicity, it is used with caution.
Figure 43.7 The palm is frequently affected by vitiligo.

C.  Tazarotene
Tazarotene is a topical retinoid, which decreases hyperpigmentation, and is sometimes used to treat the signs of
photoaging. It is available as a cream, foam, and gel. The most common adverse effects include itching, burning,
erythema, rash, and dryness.

VII.  Agents for Psoriasis
Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune skin disease that manifests as epidermal hyperplasia and dermal inflammation,
which can range from mild to disabling. It is a condition that has significant genetic associations and it tends to wax
and wane, with flare-ups that can be triggered by a number of environmental factors including stress and skin
trauma. There are several forms of psoriasis, with the most common form being plaque psoriasis. Plaque psoriasis is
characterized by the presence of sharply demarcated, thick, erythematous plaques that are usually covered by dry
silvery-white scales (Figure 43.8). The plaques range in size from 1 square centimeter to several square centimeters.
In mild-to-moderate cases, these plaques cover less than 5% of the body surface area, but in more severe cases, they
can cover more than 20% of the body. Therapies may target inflammation and the abnormal immune response, as
well as epidermal hyperproliferation.

www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1645 ---

A.  Apremilast
Apremilast  [a-PRE-mi-last] is an oral agent approved for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. It works by inhibiting
phosphodiesterase-4, which ultimately leads to reduced production of several inflammatory mediators in psoriasis.
The most common adverse effects are diarrhea, nausea, and headache. Depression may also occur. Strong CYP450
inducers (for example, carbamazepine, phenytoin) may reduce the efficacy of apremilast , and coadministration is
not recommended.

--- PAGE 1646 ---

B.  Biologic agents
Biologics are agents isolated from natural sources, including humans, animals, and microorganisms. They can be
composed of sugars, proteins, or nucleic acids or complex combinations of these substances. The biologics approved
for psoriasis are all injectable, antibody-based proteins produced by recombinant DNA technology. They are used
for moderate-to-severe psoriasis and their mechanism of action results from their interaction with specific cytokines
that induce or mediate T-cell effector function, which is important in autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis. For
example, several biologics target TNF-α, which plays multiple roles in psoriasis pathogenesis, including the
stimulation of keratinocyte proliferation, neutrophils, and the release of proinflammatory cytokines. The TNF-α
blockers include etanercept  [ee-TAN-er-sept], infliximab [in-FLIKS-e-mab], adalimumab [a-da-LIM-yoo-mab],
certolizumab pegol  [ser-toe-LIZ-oo-mab PEG-ol], and golimumab [goe-LIM-ue-mab]. Biologics that target other
cytokines important in psoriasis pathogenesis include the anti-IL-12/IL-23 medication, ustekinumab [YOO-sti-KIN-
ue-mab]; the anti-IL-23 medication, guselkumab [gue-sel-KOO-mab]; and the anti-IL-17A medications,
secukinumab [SEK-ue-KIN-ue-mab], ixekizumab [IX-ee-KIZ-ue-mab], and brodalumab [broe-DAL-ue-mab].
Though each agent has specific potential risks and adverse effects, among the adverse effects that they share include
injection or infusion reactions and increased risk of infections due to their suppression of the immune system. In
addition, because they are foreign proteins, there is a risk for the development of antidrug antibodies, which may
affect efficacy over the course of therapy.
1646

--- PAGE 1647 ---

C.  Keratolytic agents
Keratolytic agents such as coal tar and salicylic acid are effective in localized psoriasis, especially on the scalp.
They improve corticosteroid penetration. Coal tar inhibits excessive skin cell proliferation and may also have anti-
inflammatory effects. Because it is cosmetically unappealing, coal tar may have a low acceptance rate among
patients and, consequently, its use has been largely supplanted by the newer topical agents.
1647
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1648 ---

D.  Methotrexate
Methotrexate [meth-oh-TREX-ate] is the most commonly used systemic therapy for psoriasis. The drug is used in
more severe forms of psoriasis and the primary mechanism of action is due to immunosuppressive activity, resulting
from its ability to reduce DNA synthesis in cells of the immune system, particularly T lymphocytes. Methotrexate is
available in oral and injectable dosage forms. Among the common potential adverse effects are nausea, diarrhea,
mouth ulcers, hair loss, and skin rashes. The primary long-term risk is the potential for liver damage, and therefore,
periodic liver function tests are required for patients using methotrexate.
1648

--- PAGE 1649 ---

E.  Retinoids
Retinoids normalize keratinocyte differentiation and reduce hyperproliferation and inflammation. Tazarotene is a
topical retinoid used for the treatment of plaque psoriasis. Adverse effects are similar to other topical retinoids
described for acne. Acitretin [a-si-TRE-tin] is a second-generation retinoid used orally in the treatment of pustular
forms of psoriasis. Similar to oral isotretinoin used in acne, acitretin is teratogenic and women must avoid
pregnancy for at least 3 years after the use of this drug (due to its long duration of teratogenic potential). Ethanol is
contraindicated with this agent. Cheilitis, pruritus, peeling skin, and hyperlipidemia are common adverse effects.

--- PAGE 1650 ---

F.  Topical corticosteroids
Topical corticosteroids have been a mainstay of psoriasis therapy for over 50 years, and are used in many other skin
conditions as well. The available agents differ in potencies and are formulated in a variety of dosage forms,
including solutions, lotions, creams, ointments, gels, and shampoo (Figure 43.9). Upon binding to intracellular
corticosteroid receptors, these agents produce numerous effects that can be beneficial for psoriasis, including anti-
inflammatory, antiproliferative, immunosuppressive, and vasoconstrictive effects. Potential adverse effects,
especially with the long-term use of potent corticosteroids, include skin atrophy, striae, acneiform eruptions,
dermatitis, local infections, and hypopigmentation. In children, excessive use of potent agents applied to a large
surface area can cause systemic toxicity, including possible depression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis
and growth retardation.

G.  Vitamin D analogues
Calcipotriene [kal-sih-poh-TRY-een] and calcitriol  [kal-si-TRYE-ol] are synthetic vitamin D3 derivatives used
topically to treat plaque psoriasis. They inhibit keratinocyte proliferation, enhance keratinocyte differentiation, and
inhibit inflammation. Calcipotriene is available in cream, ointment, solution, and foam formulations, and calcitriol
is available as an ointment. Potential adverse effects include itching, dryness, burning, irritation, and erythema.

VIII.  Agents for Alopecia
Alopecia (baldness) is the partial or complete loss of hair from areas where hair normally grows. The most common
type of hair loss is androgenic alopecia (also known as male pattern baldness), which can occur in men or women.
Trichogenic agents are used to stimulate hair growth and slow the progression of hair loss.
1652
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1653 ---

A.  Finasteride
Finasteride [fih-NAH-steh-ride] is an oral 5-α reductase inhibitor that blocks conversion of testosterone to the potent
androgen 5-α dihydrotestosterone (DHT). High levels of DHT can cause the hair follicle to miniaturize and atrophy.
Finasteride decreases scalp and serum DHT concentrations, thus inhibiting a key factor in the etiology of
androgenic alopecia. [Note: Finasteride is used in higher doses for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (see
Chapter 41).] Adverse effects include decreased libido, decreased ejaculation, and erectile dysfunction. The drug
should not be used or handled in pregnancy, as it can cause hypospadias in a male fetus. Like minoxidil , use must be
continued to maintain therapeutic benefits.
1653
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1654 ---

B.  Minoxidil
Minoxidil  [min-OX-i-dil], originally used as a systemic antihypertensive, was noted to have the adverse effect of
increased hair growth. This adverse effect was turned into a therapeutic application in the treatment of alopecia. For
hair loss, the drug is available as a nonprescription topical foam or solution, without systemic hypotensive effects.
Minoxidil  is effective at halting hair loss in both men and women and may produce hair growth in some patients.
Although the mechanism of action is not fully known, it is believed to act, at least in part, by shortening the rest
phase of the hair cycle. The drug must be used continuously to maintain effects on hair growth. The main adverse
effects include erythema and pruritus.

I.  Overview
For thousands of years, poisons and the study of them (toxicology) have been woven into the rich fabric of the
human experience. Homer and Aristotle described the poison arrow; Socrates was executed with poison hemlock;
lead poisoning may have helped bring down the Roman Empire; Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, and Michael
Jackson all fatally overdosed on prescription medications. Toxins can be inhaled, insufflated (snorted), orally
ingested, injected, and absorbed dermally (Figure 44.1). An understanding of the varied mechanisms of toxicity
helps to develop an approach to treatment. This chapter provides an overview of the emergent management of the
poisoned patient, as well as a brief review of some of the more common and interesting toxins, their mechanisms,
clinical presentations, and clinical management.
Figure 44.1 Routes of exposure for toxins.
1658
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1659 ---

II.  Emergency Treatment of the Poisoned Patient
The first principle in the management of the poisoned patient is to treat the patient, not the poison. Airway,
breathing, and circulation are assessed and addressed initially, along with any other immediately life-threatening
toxic effect (for example, profound increases or decreases in blood pressure, heart rate, respirations, or body
temperature, or any dangerous dysrhythmias). Acid/base and electrolyte disturbances, acetaminophen and salicylate
blood levels, and results of other appropriate drug screens can be further assessed as laboratory results are obtained.
After administering oxygen, obtaining intravenous access, and placing the patient on a cardiac monitor, the poisoned
patient with altered mental status should be considered for administration of the “coma cocktail.” The coma cocktail
consists of intravenous dextrose to treat hypoglycemia, a possible toxicological cause of altered mental status,
naloxone to treat possible opioid or clonidine toxicity, and thiamine for ethanol-induced Wernicke encephalopathy.
1659

--- PAGE 1660 ---

A.  Decontamination
Once the patient is stabilized, decontamination can occur. This may include flushing the eyes with saline or tepid
water to a neutral pH for ocular exposures, rinsing the skin for dermal exposures, and/or gastrointestinal (GI)
decontamination with gastric lavage, activated charcoal, or whole bowel irrigation (utilizing a polyethylene glycol
electrolyte balanced solution) for ingestions. Therapy should be administered preferably within 1 hour of ingestion.
Several substances do not adsorb to activated charcoal (for example, lead and other heavy metals, iron, lithium,
potassium, and alcohols), limiting the use of activated charcoal unless there are coingested products.
1660
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1661 ---

B.  Elimination enhancement
1.  Hemodialysis
The elimination of some medications/toxins may be enhanced by hemodialysis if certain properties are met, such as
low protein binding, small volume of distribution, small molecular weight, and water solubility of the toxin.
Examples of medications or substances that can be removed with hemodialysis include methanol, ethylene glycol,
salicylates, theophylline, phenobarbital , and lithium.
2.  Urinary alkalinization
Alkalinization of the urine enhances the elimination of salicylates or phenobarbital . Increasing the urine pH with
intravenous sodium bicarbonate transforms the drug into an ionized form that prevents reabsorption, thereby
trapping it in the urine to be excreted by the kidney. The goal urine pH is 7.5 to 8, while ensuring the serum pH does
not exceed 7.55.
3.  Multiple-dose activated charcoal
Multiple-dose activated charcoal enhances the elimination of certain drugs (for example, theophylline,
phenobarbital , digoxin, carbamazepine). Activated charcoal is extremely porous and has a high surface area, which
creates a gradient across the lumen of the gut. Medications traverse from areas of high concentration to low
concentration, promoting absorbed medication to cross back into the gut to be adsorbed by the activated charcoal. In
addition, activated charcoal blocks the reabsorption of medications that undergo enterohepatic recirculation (such as
phenytoin), by adsorbing the substance to the activated charcoal (Figure 44.2). Bowel sounds must be present prior
to each activated charcoal dose to prevent obstruction.

A.  Acetaminophen
Acetaminophen produces toxicity when normal metabolic pathways become saturated, leading to the production of a
hepatotoxic metabolite (N -acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, NAPQI) (Figure 44.3). After therapeutic doses of
acetaminophen, the liver generates glutathione, which detoxifies NAPQI. However, in overdose, glutathione is
depleted, leaving the metabolite to produce toxicity. There are four phases typically describing acetaminophen
toxicity (Figure 44.4). The antidote for acetaminophen toxicity, N-acetylcysteine (NAC ), works as a glutathione
precursor and glutathione substitute, and assists with sulfation. NAC  may also function as an antioxidant to aid in
recovery. NAC  is most effective when initiated within 8 to 10 hours of ingestion. The Rumack-Matthew nomogram
(Figure 44.5), which is based on the time of ingestion and the serum acetaminophen level, is utilized after an acute
ingestion to determine if NAC  therapy is needed. The nomogram is helpful to predict acetaminophen toxicity when
levels can be obtained between 4 and 24 hours postingestion.

B.  Alcohols
1.  Methanol (wood alcohol) and ethylene glycol
Methanol is found in products like windshield washer fluid and model airplane fuel. Ethylene glycol is most
commonly found in radiator antifreeze. These primary alcohols are relatively nontoxic and mainly cause central
nervous system (CNS) depression. However, methanol and ethylene glycol are oxidized to toxic products: formic
acid in the case of methanol, and glycolic, glyoxylic, and oxalic acids in the case of ethylene glycol. Fomepizole
[foe-MEP-i-zole] inhibits this oxidative pathway by blocking alcohol dehydrogenase. [Note: Ethanol is an
alternative if fomepizole is not available.] It prevents the formation of toxic metabolites and allows the parent
alcohols to be excreted by the kidney (Figure 44.6). Hemodialysis is often utilized to remove the toxic acids that are
already produced. In addition, cofactors are administered to encourage metabolism to nontoxic metabolites ( folate
for methanol, thiamine and pyridoxine for ethylene glycol). If untreated, methanol ingestion may produce blindness,
metabolic acidosis, seizures, and coma. Ethylene glycol ingestion may lead to renal failure, hypocalcemia, metabolic
acidosis, and heart failure.

2.  Isopropanol (rubbing alcohol, isopropyl alcohol)
This secondary alcohol is metabolized to acetone via alcohol dehydrogenase. Acetone cannot be further oxidized to
carboxylic acids, and therefore, acidemia does not occur. Because isopropyl alcohol is not metabolized to a toxic
metabolite, no antidote is necessary to treat an isopropyl alcohol ingestion. Isopropanol is a known CNS depressant
(approximately twice as intoxicating as ethanol) and GI irritant. Treatment centers on supportive care.

C.  Carbon monoxide
Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas. It is a natural by-product of the combustion of
carbonaceous materials, and common sources of this gas include automobiles, poorly vented furnaces, fireplaces,
wood-burning stoves, kerosene space heaters, house fires, charcoal grills, and generators. Following inhalation,
carbon monoxide rapidly binds to hemoglobin to produce carboxyhemoglobin. The binding affinity of carbon
monoxide to hemoglobin is 230 to 270 times greater than that of oxygen. Consequently, even low concentrations of
carbon monoxide in the air can produce significant levels of carboxyhemoglobin. In addition, bound carbon
monoxide increases hemoglobin affinity for oxygen at the other oxygen-binding sites. This high-affinity binding of
oxygen prevents the unloading of oxygen at the tissues, further reducing oxygen delivery ( Figure 44.7). The
presence of this highly oxygenated blood may produce “cherry red” skin. Carbon monoxide toxicity can also occur
following inhalation or ingestion of methylene chloride found in paint strippers. Once absorbed, methylene chloride
is metabolized to carbon monoxide through the hepatic cytochrome P450 pathway. The symptoms of carbon
monoxide intoxication are consistent with hypoxia, including headache, dyspnea, lethargy, confusion, and
drowsiness. Higher exposure levels can lead to seizures, coma, and death. The management of a carbon monoxide–
poisoned patient includes prompt removal from the source of carbon monoxide, and institution of 100% oxygen by
nonrebreathing face mask or endotracheal tube. In patients with severe intoxication, oxygenation in a hyperbaric
chamber is recommended.

carbon monoxyhemoglobin.

D.  Cyanide
Cyanide is one of the toxic products of combustion produced during house fires. Its principal toxicity occurs as a
result of the inactivation of the enzyme cytochrome oxidase (cytochrome a3), leading to the inhibition of cellular
respiration. Therefore, even in the presence of oxygen, tissues with a high oxygen demand such as the brain and
heart are adversely affected. Death can occur quickly due to arrest of oxidative phosphorylation and production of
adenosine triphosphate. The antidote, hydroxocobalamin (vitamin B12a), is administered intravenously to bind the
cyanide and produce cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12) without the adverse effects of hypotension or methemoglobin
production seen with older antidotes. The older cyanide antidote kit consists of sodium nitrite to form
cyanomethemoglobin and sodium thiosulfate to accelerate the production of thiocyanate, which is much less toxic
than cyanide and is quickly excreted in urine. To avoid the oxygen carrying capacity becoming too low in patients
with smoke inhalation and cyanide toxicity, the induction of methemoglobin with sodium nitrite should be avoided
unless the carboxyhemoglobin concentration is less than 10%.

E.  Iron
The incidence of pediatric iron toxicity has greatly diminished during the past two decades due to education and
changes in packaging and labeling of iron products. Iron is radiopaque and may show up on an abdominal
radiograph if the product contains a sufficient concentration of elemental iron. Toxic effects can be expected with
ingestions as little as 20 mg/kg of elemental iron, and doses of 60 mg/kg may be lethal. Each iron salt contains a
different concentration of elemental iron (Figure 44.8). A serum iron level should be obtained, since levels between
500 and 1000 μg/dL have been associated with shock and levels higher than 1000 μg/dL with death. Patients with
iron toxicity usually present with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Depending on the amount of elemental iron
ingested, the patient may experience a latent period or may progress quickly to hypovolemia, metabolic acidosis,
hypotension, and coagulopathy. Ultimately, hepatic failure and multisystem failure, coma, and death may occur.
Deferoxamine [de-fer-OKS-a-meen], an iron-specific chelator, binds free iron, creating ferrioxamine, which is
excreted in the urine. Hypotension may occur if rapid intravenous boluses of deferoxamine are administered instead
of a continuous infusion.

F.  Lead
Lead is ubiquitous in the environment, with sources of exposure including old paint, drinking water, industrial
pollution, food, and contaminated dust. Most chronic exposure to lead occurs with inorganic lead salts, such as those
in paint used in housing constructed prior to 1978. Adults absorb about 10% of ingested lead, whereas children
absorb about 40%. Inorganic forms of lead are initially distributed to the soft tissues and more slowly redistribute to
bone, teeth, and hair. Lead impairs bone formation and causes increased calcium deposition in long bones visible on
x-ray. Ingested lead is radiopaque and may appear on an abdominal radiograph if present in the GI tract. Lead has an
apparent blood half-life of about 1 to 2 months, whereas its half-life in the bone is 20 to 30 years. Chronic exposure
to lead can have serious effects on several tissues (Figure 44.9). Early symptoms of lead toxicity can include
discomfort and constipation (and, occasionally, diarrhea), whereas higher exposures can produce painful intestinal
spasms. CNS effects from lead include headaches, confusion, clumsiness, insomnia, fatigue, and impaired
concentration. As the disease progresses, clonic convulsions and coma can occur. Death is rare, given the ability to
treat lead intoxication with chelation therapy. Blood levels of 5 to 20 μg/dL in children have been shown to lower IQ
in the absence of other symptoms. Finally, lead can cause hypochromic, microcytic anemia as a result of a shortened
erythrocyte life span and disruption of heme synthesis.
Figure 44.9 Comparison of effects of lead on children and adults. From the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. http://wonder.cdc.gov/.
Multiple chelators can be utilized in the treatment of lead toxicity. When levels are greater than 45 μg/dL, but less
than 70 μg/dL in children, succimer (dimercaptosuccinic acid [DMSA]), an oral chelator, is the treatment of choice.
With lead levels greater than 70 μg/dL or if encephalopathy is present, dual parenteral therapy is required with
dimercaprol  given intramuscularly and calcium disodium edetate given intravenously. Dimercaprol  is suspended in
peanut oil and should not be given to those with a peanut allergy.

G.  Organophosphate and carbamate insecticides
These insecticides exert their toxicity through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, with subsequent accumulation of
excess acetylcholine producing nicotinic (mydriasis, fasciculations, muscle weakness, tachycardia, hypertension)
and muscarinic (diarrhea, urination, miosis, bradycardia, bronchorrhea, emesis, lacrimation, salivation) effects.
Carbamates reversibly bind to acetylcholinesterase, whereas organophosphates undergo an aging process to
ultimately irreversibly inactivate the enzyme. Organophosphate nerve agents, such as sarin, soman, and tabun, have
the same mechanism of action, but the aging process is much more rapid compared to insecticides. Atropine, a
muscarinic receptor antagonist, and pralidoxime, an oxime to reactivate cholinesterase, should be administered
intravenously or intramuscularly to treat the muscarinic and nicotinic effects, respectively (see Chapter 4).

44.4Study Questions
Choose the ONE best answer.
A 3-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother, who reports that he has been crying
continuously and “does not want to play or eat” for the past few days. She also states that he has not had
regular bowel movements, with mostly constipation and occasional diarrhea, and frequently complains of
abdominal pain. The child now has an altered level of consciousness, is difficult to arouse, and begins to
seize. The clinician rules out infection and other medical causes. Upon questioning, the mother states that the
house is in an older neighborhood, that her house has not been remodeled or repainted since the 1940s, and
that the paint is chipping around the windows and doors. The child is otherwise breathing on his own and
urinating normally. Which toxin would you expect to be producing such severe effects in this child?
A.  Iron
B.  Lead
C.  Carbon monoxide
D.  Cyanide
Correct answer = B. Lead poisoning is common among children in older homes painted before lead was removed
from paint. Paint chips with lead are easily ingested by toddlers, and excessively high lead levels can lead to the
signs and symptoms described plus clumsiness, confusion, headaches, coma, constipation, intestinal spasms, and
anemia. Death is rare when chelation therapy is instituted. Iron can produce abdominal pain, but more often
would cause diarrhea, vomiting, and volume loss. Carbon monoxide would affect the entire household, depending
on the source. Clinical effects from carbon monoxide would include headache, nausea, and CNS depression. If he
had cyanide poisoning, death would have occurred quickly following respiratory arrest of oxidative
phosphorylation and production of adenosine triphosphate, but this child has been exhibiting symptoms over
several days.
A 41-year-old male jeweler presents to the emergency department after he was found unconscious on the
floor of the shop by a coworker. The coworker states that the patient complained of being cold this morning
around 8 AM (the central heat was broken, and the outdoor temperature was 34°F) and that since noon, he had
been complaining of headache, drowsiness, confusion, and nausea. The clinician notices that he has cherry
red skin. What is the most likely toxin causing his signs and symptoms?
A.  Ethylene glycol
B.  Cyanide
C.  Acetaminophen
D.  Carbon monoxide
Correct answer = D. Although watch makers and other professionals who use electroplating may be at higher risk
for cyanide exposure because many plating baths use cyanide-containing ingredients (for example, potassium
cyanide), this patient shows signs of carbon monoxide poisoning, such as cherry red skin, headache, confusion,
nausea, and drowsiness leading to unconsciousness. The history also leads us to believe that this person may have
been using a space heater to stay warm, which would be consistent with the description. A carboxyhemoglobin
level should be obtained to confirm the exposure. Cyanide in low doses from such an occupational exposure can
present with loss of consciousness, flushing, headache, and confusion. Chronically, workers may develop a rash
after handling cyanide solutions. Also, an odor of bitter almonds may be present. An arterial blood gas and a
venous blood gas could be obtained and compared to determine if cyanide is present (a lack of oxygen extraction
would be present on the venous side). Ethylene glycol toxicity may cause alterations in mental status, but the
history did not include anything suggesting a toxic alcohol ingestion. Acetaminophen toxicity is not consistent
with this presentation.
A 50-year-old migrant field worker comes to the emergency department and complains of diarrhea, tearing,
nausea and vomiting, and sweating. The clinician notices that he looks generally anxious and has fine
fasciculations in the muscles of the upper chest as well as pinpoint pupils. Which antidote should he receive
first?
A.  N -acetylcysteine
B.  Sodium nitrite
C.  Deferoxamine
D.  Atropine
Correct answer = D. Atropine is appropriate for this patient, who has symptoms consistent with organophosphate
(insecticide) poisoning. The mnemonic DUMBBELS (diarrhea, urination, miosis, bronchorrhea/bradycardia,
emesis, lacrimation, salivation) can be used to remember the signs and symptoms of cholinergic toxicity. An
anticholinergic antidote, atropine, controls these muscarinic symptoms, whereas the antidote pralidoxime treats
the nicotinic symptoms like fasciculations (involuntary muscle quivering or twitching). N-acetylcysteine is the
antidote for acetaminophen overdose and acts as a sulfhydryl donor. Sodium nitrite is one of the antidotes
included in the old cyanide antidote kit (sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate). Deferoxamine is the chelating
agent for iron.
A 45-year-old man presented to the emergency department 18 hours after ingesting an unknown product. On
presentation, he is tachycardic, hypertensive, tachypneic, and complaining of flank pain. A metabolic panel1680

44.8is obtained, and the patient has a large anion gap acidosis, an increased creatinine, and hypocalcemia. Which
substance was most likely ingested?
A.  Methanol
B.  Acetaminophen
C.  Ethylene glycol
D.  Iron
Correct answer = C. Ethylene glycol produces a metabolic acidosis from the toxic metabolites. The formation of
calcium oxalate crystals, which can be found on urinalysis, leads to hypocalcemia and renal failure. The treatment
regimen for this patient would include intravenous fomepizole, if some of the parent compound was still present,
and hemodialysis. Methanol may produce a metabolic acidosis as well, but its target organ of toxicity is the eyes
instead of the kidneys as with ethylene glycol. Acetaminophen toxicity may produce upper quadrant pain within
the first 24 hours, but vital sign abnormalities are not usually found during this time frame. Iron toxicity may also
produce a metabolic acidosis and tachycardia. However, hypocalcemia does not occur.
A 27-year-old woman presents to the emergency department 6 hours after reportedly ingesting 20 tablets of
acetaminophen 500 mg. An acetaminophen level is drawn, but it has to be sent out to another lab and will not
return for another 6 hours. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient?
A.  Administer a dose of activated charcoal.
B.  Start empirical N -acetylcysteine therapy.
C.  Wait for the level to return and then decide what to do.
D.  Draw a NAPQI level.
Correct answer = B. N-acetylcysteine should be started empirically on the basis of the history, and then, once the
level returns and is plotted on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram, a final decision on whether to continue therapy
can be made. Activated charcoal would not be of any benefit 6 hours post-acetaminophen ingestion. The optimal
time frame to give N-acetylcysteine is within 8 to 10 hours postingestion. So, waiting on the level to return would
put the patient more than 12 hours postingestion. Therefore, initiation of N-acetylcysteine therapy should happen,
if possible during the optimal time frame. Clinicians are unable to draw a NAPQI level and therefore cannot
utilize this to guide therapy.
A 15-year-old girl presents to the emergency department with CNS depression. She is slightly bradycardic
and slightly hypotensive. Upon further questioning, the mother admits that the patient was found with an
open bottle of clonidine. Which antidote might be beneficial for this patient?
A.  Flumazenil
B.  Atropine
C.  Deferoxamine
D.  Naloxone
Correct answer = D. Naloxone has a reversal rate of the CNS effects of approximately 50% in clonidine
ingestions. Flumazenil reverses benzodiazepines and has no effect on clonidine. Atropine is an anticholinergic
agent and would not improve the CNS depression. Deferoxamine is the chelator for iron.
A 45-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a complaint of persistent vomiting. The
patient appears intoxicated, but an ethanol level returns as negative and her basic metabolic panel is
unremarkable. Which substance did she probably ingest?
A.  Isopropyl alcohol
B.  Methanol
C.  Ethylene glycol
D.  Ethanol
Correct answer = A. Isopropyl alcohol produces twice as much CNS depression as ethanol and is known to cause
GI distress. Isopropyl alcohol is metabolized to acetone, so a metabolic acidosis does not result (which is in
contrast to the acidosis generated by methanol and ethylene glycol). The ethanol level was negative, eliminating
ethanol as an ingestion.
A 5-year-old boy is brought in to the healthcare facility for being irritable and failure to thrive. He is drowsy,
and his vital signs are normal. The doctor diagnoses him with lead toxicity when the blood lead level returns
as 75 μg/dL. Which chelator regimen should be started?
A.  Dimercaprol
B.  Calcium disodium edetate
C.  Both dimercaprol and calcium disodium edetate
D.  Succimer
Correct answer = C. Dual parenteral therapy with dimercaprol and calcium disodium edetate is indicated if
encephalopathy is present, or if the lead level is greater than 70 μg/dL in a child. Dimercaprol intramuscular
therapy is initiated 4 hours prior to the intravenous administration of calcium disodium edetate when both
medications are required. Succimer (dimercaptosuccinic acid, DMSA) is utilized when the lead level is greater
than 45 μg/dL but less than 70 μg/dL, without encephalopathy.1681

44.10A healthy 2-year-old boy ingested one of his mother’s 2 mg clonazepam tablets 1 hour ago. The child
presented to the emergency department with CNS depression but a normal heart rate and blood pressure. His
bedside glucose check is also normal. Which antidote might be helpful?
A.  Flumazenil
B.  Naloxone
C.  Physostigmine
D.  Fomepizole
Correct answer = A. Flumazenil is a competitive benzodiazepine antagonist that reverses the CNS depression
from benzodiazepines such as clonazepam. After flumazenil administration, resedation usually occurs, since the
duration of the benzodiazepine is longer than that of the flumazenil. Naloxone reverses the effects from opioids
and clonidine, not benzodiazepines. Physostigmine is the antidote for anticholinergic toxicity. Fomepizole is the
antidote for methanol or ethylene glycol toxicity.
A 47-year-old man with a history of a seizure disorder, maintained on phenytoin, presented to the emergency
department with salicylate toxicity. The salicylate level was 50 mg/dL (15 to 35 mg/dL therapeutic range)
and the phenytoin level was 15 mg/L (10 to 20 mg/L therapeutic range). What therapy can be considered to
enhance the elimination of salicylate without impacting the phenytoin?
A.  Multiple doses of activated charcoal
B.  Urinary alkalinization
C.  Whole bowel irrigation
D.  Urinary acidification
Correct answer = B. Urinary alkalinization enhances the elimination of the salicylate but does not affect the
therapeutic phenytoin level. Multiple doses of activated charcoal would lower the concentration of both
medications, rendering the phenytoin subtherapeutic. Whole bowel irrigation is another GI decontamination
modality involving administration of large quantities (up to 2 L/h in adults) of a polyethylene glycol–balanced
electrolyte solution via a nasogastric tube until the patient generates clear rectal effluent.

Drugs of Abuse

I.  Overview
A boy inhales paint fumes to momentarily escape his surroundings of poverty; a new gang member smokes crack
with his friends to feel like he belongs; a curious girl swallows a “Molly” to see what it is like; a prescription drug
abuser injects fentanyl -laced heroin to substitute for the pain pills that are more difficult to obtain; and a lonely
widower drinks another shot of bourbon to help remember the past and forget the present. In each of these cases,
chemicals are being used for nontherapeutic effects on the body or mind. Excessive use or misuse of drugs or
ethanol  (commonly known as alcohol) for intoxicating or mind-altering effects is considered substance misuse, and
those who misuse substances are considered to have a substance use disorder. Figure 45.1 provides a list of
commonly abused substances.
Figure 45.1 Summary of commonly abused substances.
Substance use disorders occur in many forms and their effects have been witnessed throughout the history of the
world. The lure of addictive substances continues to impact people today. In 2015, approximately 10.1% of the
population in the United States were current users of some form of illicit substance (Figure 45.2), while 6.2% were
considered to have an alcohol use disorder, and 4.7% misused prescription medications. Abused substances have
become progressively more potent, and their routes of administration have become increasingly effective, resulting
in greater risks of addiction (Figure 45.3) and toxicity. Some examples of the methods, mechanisms, and clinical
manifestations of toxicity of commonly abused substances are discussed in this chapter.

II.  Sympathomimetics
Sympathomimetics are stimulants that mimic the sympathetic nervous system, producing “fight-or-flight” responses.
Sympathomimetics usually produce a relative increase of adrenergic neurotransmitters at the site of action (Figure
45.4), thereby causing effects such as tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, and tachypnea. These agents come
from natural sources, such as plants, or are synthesized in legitimate or clandestine laboratories. Aside from the
stimulant effect, many of these agents have a remarkable ability to produce pleasure. Consequently, their addictive
potential and monetary value on the illicit market offer a huge profit motive.
Figure 45.4 Mechanism of action of cocaine.
1763
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1764 ---

A.  Cocaine
Cocaine is derived from the coca shrub (Erythroxylum coca ) that grows in the foothills of the Andes Mountains in
South America. It causes central nervous system (CNS) stimulation by inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine into
the adrenergic neuron, thus increasing the availability of catecholamines at the synapse. The profound ability of
cocaine to stimulate the pleasure center of the human brain is thought to result from inhibition of reuptake of
dopamine and serotonin. Cocaine has minimal bioavailability when taken by the oral route. Instead, the cocaine
hydrochloride powder is snorted, or solubilized and injected. The cocaine powder cannot be effectively smoked, as
it is destroyed upon heating. However, crack cocaine, an alkaloidal form, can be smoked. Smoking is an extremely
effective route of administration, as the lungs are richly perfused with blood and carry the drug within seconds to its
site of action, the brain. This causes an intense euphoria or “rush” that is followed rapidly by an intense dysphoria or
“crash.” It is this immediate positive reinforcement, followed rapidly by the negative reinforcement that makes the
drug, particularly in this form, so addictive. Like most drugs of abuse, street cocaine powder and crack are usually
adulterated to increase the bulk, mimic the action, and thereby increase the profitability.
The clinical manifestations of cocaine toxicity are a function of its stimulant effects. Common reasons for
cocaine users to present to the emergency department include psychiatric complaints (depression precipitated by
cocaine dysphoria, agitation/paranoia), convulsions, hyperthermia, and chest pain. Hyperthermia is caused by
cocaine-induced CNS stimulation that increases heat production and vasoconstrictive effects of cocaine that
minimize the ability to dissipate heat. Cocaine-related chest pain can be chest muscle pain or cardiac in nature, as
cocaine causes vasoconstriction of coronary arteries and accelerates the atherosclerotic process. Commonly, cocaine
is consumed with ethanol , which creates a secondary metabolite cocaethylene. The metabolite is cardiotoxic and
further contributes to cardiac issues related to cocaine consumption. Cocaine chest pain can also be related to
pulmonary damage caused by inhalation of this heated impure substance. Cocaine convulsions are a natural
extension of the CNS stimulant effect (Figure 45.5). Cocaine toxicity is treated by calming and cooling the patient.
Benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam, help to calm the agitated patient and can both treat and prevent convulsions. In
addition, the calming effect helps cool the patient and manage hyperthermia. This is an important therapeutic effect,
as hyperthermia is one of the major causes of cocaine fatalities. The remainder of cocaine toxicity is treated with
short-acting antihypertensives, anticonvulsants, and symptomatic supportive care.

B.  Amphetamines
Amphetamines such as methamphetamine are sympathomimetics with clinical effects very similar to those of
cocaine. Amphetamines act by enhancing the release of biogenic amines from the storage sites in the nerve
terminals. In many cases, these effects may last longer and are associated with more stimulation and less euphoria
when compared to cocaine. Treatment of amphetamine toxicity is similar to that of cocaine toxicity. Therapeutic
uses of amphetamines are presented in Chapter 15.
1767

--- PAGE 1768 ---

C.  Methylenedioxymethamphetamine
Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA ), commonly known as ecstasy or molly, is a hallucinogenic
amphetamine with profound serotonin-releasing effects (Figure 45.6). However, like most illicit substances, MDMA
is often substituted or adulterated with other drugs such as methylone. The chemical structure of methylone differs
from MDMA  by one carbonyl group (Figure 45.7), but the drug is more profitable to dealers and does not produce
the same euphoric effect. Because of its unique serotonin properties, MDMA  is sometimes referred to as an
“empathogen,” and tactile stimulation is particularly pleasurable to users. Many users describe a sense of well-being
and social interactivity, and sexual offenders have also taken advantage of this property of the drug. Like many
amphetamines, MDMA  can cause bruxism (teeth grinding) and trismus (jaw clenching), which explain the baby
pacifiers and lollipops that have been popularized among “ravers.” Among the most disturbing properties of MDMA
abuse is its propensity to cause profound hyperthermia, altered mental status, and serotonin syndrome.
Benzodiazepines help to calm and cool the patient, and life-threatening hyperthermia has been treated with
neuromuscular blockers and endotracheal intubation to control excessive movement and heat generation.
Cyproheptadine is a serotonin antagonist that has been used to treat serotonin syndrome; however, one of its
practical limitations is that it is only available in an oral formulation.

D.  Synthetic cathinones
Cathinone is the psychoactive component in the evergreen shrub Khat (Catha edulis ) native to East Africa and the
Arabian Peninsula. Synthetic cathinones, also known as “bath salts,” have become increasingly popular. These
products are packaged and labeled as “bath salts” or “pond water cleaner” to circumvent detection, prosecution, and
enforcement. Many of these packages read “not for human consumption,” although they are sold with an unstated
understanding by the seller and buyer that they produce intoxication. Synthetic cathinones are not easily detected in
urine toxicology screens.
Methcathinone, butylone, methylenedioxypyrovalerone, and naphyrone are just a few examples of synthetic
cathinones. These drugs increase the release and inhibit the reuptake of catecholamines (norepinephrine,
epinephrine, and dopamine) in a manner very similar to cocaine and amphetamines. A rapid onset of amphetamine-
like stimulation with psychotomimetic effects of variable duration is common with synthetic cathinones. Bath salts
are generally snorted or ingested, but they may also be injected. Treatment is similar to the emergent treatment of
amphetamines and cocaine.

III.  Hallucinogens
Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), marijuana, and synthetic cannabinoids are substances that fall into this category.
1772
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1773 ---

A.  Lysergic acid diethylamide
LSD, lysergic acid diethylamide, is perhaps the most commonly recognized drug in the hallucinogen class. LSD was
first created from ergot in 1938 by Dr. Albert Hoffman. LSD produces its psychedelic effects through serving as a
potent partial agonist at 5-HT2A receptors. Aside from the very colorful hallucinations, the drug is also responsible
for mood alterations, sleep disturbances, and anxiety. Repeated use rapidly produces tolerance through down-
regulation of serotonin receptors.
Although physical adverse effects are typically minimal, LSD may cause mydriasis, tachycardia, increased blood
pressure and body temperature, dizziness, decreased appetite, and sweating. Perhaps, the most troubling side effects
are the loss of judgment and impaired reasoning associated with use of LSD. This can sometimes be an exaggerated
effect with extreme panic, which is known by individuals as a “bad trip,” and may lead to trauma. Recently, a group
of synthetic serotonin agonists collectively known as “N-Bomb” have been substituted for LSD. Like LSD, these
agents are used in liquid form or with blotter paper and have resulted in hypertension, convulsions, and accidental
traumatic injury and death.

B.  Marijuana
Cannabis is a plant that has been used by humans for over 10,000 years. Centuries-old Chinese documents describe
the use of cannabis for clothing production, food, and as an agent to communicate with spirits. Today, marijuana is
the most frequently used illicit drug, and the illicit drug that new users are most likely to try ( Figure 45.8). Those
numbers are expected to grow as liberalization of marijuana laws continue throughout the United States. Certain
cannabis plants can be used for making rope or clothing; however, the species Cannabis sativa is the plant most
often used for its psychoactive properties. The main psychoactive alkaloid contained in marijuana is Δ9-
tetrahydrocannabinol  [tet-ra-HY-dro-can-NAB-i-nol] (THC ). Growing techniques have evolved over the past 50
years, and THC  concentrations found in the plant have increased as much as 20-fold during that time period.
Figure 45.8 First specific drug associated with initiation of illicit drug use among past-
year illicit drug initiates aged 12 or older.
Specific receptors in the brain, cannabinoid or CB1 receptors, were discovered in the late 1980s and found to be
reactive to THC . When CB1 receptors are activated by marijuana, effects include physical relaxation, hyperphagia
(increased appetite), increased heart rate, decreased muscle coordination, conjunctivitis, and minor pain control
(Figure 45.9). Depending on the social situation, THC  can produce euphoria, followed by drowsiness and relaxation.
Although hallucinations are typically not as robust as those observed with use of LSD, marijuana is often used for
the mild hallucinogenic effects that it produces. Marijuana stimulates the amygdala, causing the user to have a sense
of novelty to anything the user encounters through an enhancement of sensory activity. For this same reason, heavy
users have a down-regulation in their CB1 receptors, leaving them with a feeling of boredom when not taking the
drug. The effects of marijuana on γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the hippocampus diminish the capacity for short-
term memory in users, and this effect seems to be more pronounced in adolescents. In addition to adversely affecting
1774
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1775 ---

short-term memory and mental activity, THC  decreases muscle strength and impairs highly skilled motor activity,
such as that required to drive a car. The effects of THC  appear immediately after smoking marijuana, but maximum
effects take about 20 minutes. By 3 hours, the effects largely disappear.

Figure 45.9 Effects of tetrahydrocannabinol.
In chronic marijuana users, tolerance develops rapidly, 9% of all users and 17% of adolescent users will develop
dependence, and withdrawal has been observed. Marijuana may be found in the body up to 3 months after last usage
in heavy chronic users. For this reason, withdrawal occurs much later in individuals who previously used marijuana
heavily. Withdrawal may include cravings, insomnia, depression, pain, and irritability.
Although not well studied for medicinal use, marijuana has been used as an adjuvant in the treatment of
chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), cachexia secondary to cancer and AIDS, epilepsy, chronic
pain, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, and anxiety. Synthetic THC  medications are available as prescription products
and include dronabinol  [droe-NAB-i-nol] and nabilone [NA-bi-lone]. These medications are used for the prevention
of CINV. Nabiximols, a medication created from the extract of the Cannabis sativa plant, is an oromucosal spray
available in several countries throughout the world for the treatment of spasticity in multiple sclerosis.

--- PAGE 1778 ---

C.  Synthetic cannabinoids
Synthetic cannabinoids are sprayed onto plant material in a process known as dusting. These first-generation
products such as “Spice” and “K2” are then smoked to produce intoxication. Since the molecular structure of
synthetic cannabinoids is much different from the cannabinoids found in marijuana plants, users do not test positive
for THC  with traditional drug tests. Sympathomimetic effects may also be seen in users, including tachycardia and
hypertension. The greatest danger with use of these agents includes extreme hallucinations and psychotic reactions.
More recent formulations of synthetic cannabinoids and their contaminants have caused convulsions, acute kidney
injury, and deaths.

IV.  Ethanol
Ethanol  (or alcohol) is a clear colorless hydroxylated hydrocarbon that is the product of fermentation of fruits,
grains, or vegetables. Ethanol  consumption is a major cause of deadly automobile accidents, drownings, and fatal
falls, and is a related factor in many hospital admissions. Ethanol  is the most commonly abused substance in modern
society, with the prevalence of alcohol use disorder as high as 12.6% of the population in some regions of the world.
Alcoholism decreases life expectancy by 10 to 15 years and impacts one in three families. It is thought that ethanol
exerts its desired and toxic effects through several mechanisms, including enhanced effects of the inhibitory
neurotransmitter GABA, increased release of endogenous opioids, and altered levels of serotonin and dopamine.
Ethanol  is a selective CNS depressant at low doses, resulting in decreased inhibitions and the characteristic
loquaciousness or drunken behavior. At high doses, it is a general CNS depressant, which can result in coma and
respiratory depression.
Drinking ethanol  traditionally has been the most common route of administration, although recently the
inhalation of aerosolized ethanol  has gained popularity. Ethanol  is absorbed from the stomach and duodenum, and
food slows and decreases absorption. Peak ethanol  levels are generally achieved in 20 minutes to 1 hour of
ingestion. There is a greater subjective feeling of intoxication while levels are ascending (absorption), as compared
to when levels are descending. Ethanol  is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to acetaldehyde and then by
aldehyde dehydrogenase to acetate in the liver (Figure 45.10). It is metabolized by zero-order elimination at
approximately 15 to 40 mg/dL/h. Because there is a constant blood-to-breath ratio of 2100:1, a breath sample can be
used to determine blood alcohol levels. Medical management of acute ethanol  toxicity includes symptomatic
supportive care and thiamine and folate administration. Patients with extremely high alcohol levels can be dialyzed,
although that is rarely necessary, and could precipitate withdrawal in an alcoholic.
Figure 45.10 The pathway of ethanol metabolism. ADH = alcohol dehydrogenase;
ALDH = acetaldehyde dehydrogenase.
Chronic ethanol  abuse can cause profound hepatic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, endocrine, metabolic,
and CNS damage (Figure 45.11). Sudden cessation of ethanol  ingestion in a heavy drinker can precipitate
withdrawal manifested by tachycardia, sweating, tremor, anxiety, agitation, hallucinations, and convulsions. Alcohol
withdrawal is a life-threatening situation that should be medically managed with symptomatic/supportive care,
1779

benzodiazepines, and long-term addiction treatment. The following are drugs used in the treatment of alcohol
dependence:
Figure 45.11 The effects of chronic alcohol abuse.
1780
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1781 ---

A.  Disulfiram
Disulfiram [dye-SUL-fi-ram] blocks the oxidation of acetaldehyde to acetic acid by inhibiting aldehyde
dehydrogenase (Figure 45.12). This results in the accumulation of acetaldehyde in the blood, causing flushing,
tachycardia, hyperventilation, and nausea. Disulfiram has found some use in patients seriously desiring to stop
alcohol ingestion. A conditioned avoidance response is induced so that the patient abstains from alcohol to prevent
the unpleasant effects of disulfiram-induced acetaldehyde accumulation.
Figure 45.12 The effect of disulfiram on the metabolism of ethanol.

--- PAGE 1782 ---

B.  Naltrexone
Naltrexone [nal-TREX-own] is a competitive and relatively long-acting opioid antagonist that helps decrease
cravings for alcohol. It should be used in conjunction with supportive psychotherapy. Naltrexone is better tolerated
than disulfiram and does not produce the aversive reaction that disulfiram does.

--- PAGE 1783 ---

C.  Acamprosate
Acamprosate [a-kam-PROE-sate] is an agent used in alcohol dependence treatment programs and is thought to
decrease cravings through its regulatory effects on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-mediated glutamatergic
excitation. This agent should also be used in conjunction with supportive psychotherapy.

V.  Prescription Drug Abuse
This chapter has discussed many of the illicit substances that are abused by individuals. It is important to also
mention that parts of the world, including the United States and portions of Europe, are currently experiencing an
epidemic of prescription drug abuse. Some commonly abused prescription drugs include opioids and
benzodiazepines. In the United States, between 1997 and 2007, there was a 600% increase in the prescribing of
opioids, and by 2010, enough opioid prescription pain relievers were sold in the United States to medicate every
American adult with 5 mg of hydrocodone every 4 hours for 1 month. An increased emphasis on treating pain as the
“fifth vital sign,” coupled with an exaggerated belief in the beneficial capacity of these medications and a
minimization of their inherent toxicity among the lay public and health professionals, was among the many possible
explanations for the epidemic. Recent efforts have been made to decrease the misuse of prescription opioids, which
has resulted in an increased use of heroin, often adulterated with fentanyl  and extremely potent fentanyl  derivatives
such as carfentanil . Reversal of fentanyl  and its derivatives is much more difficult than reversal of opioids such as
morphine. This has contributed to a dramatic increase in death rates, with over 33,000 overdose deaths in the United
States alone in 2015 (Figure 45.13). Medications for the treatment of opioid toxicity and dependence are reviewed in
Chapter 14.

involved with using the drug for the first time. Which is a correct response to her question?
A.  Exaggerated hallucinations
B.  Cardiomyopathy
C.  Hyperphagia
D.  Bronchitis
Correct answer = A. Exaggerated hallucinations, sometimes known as “bad trips,” may occur, even in first-time
users. These hallucinations can lead to extreme panic, which has caused individuals to react in a manner very
uncharacteristic of their typical behavior.
A 58-year-old man is brought into the emergency department following an automobile accident. His blood
alcohol level on admission is 280 mg/dL. He has been treated in the past for seizures related to alcohol
abuse, and he confirms that he has been drinking heavily over the past month since losing his job. What
treatment should be given to this patient if he begins to go into withdrawal while hospitalized?
A.  Acamprosate
B.  Lorazepam
C.  Naltrexone
D.  Disulfiram
Correct answer = B. Should this patient go into alcohol withdrawal, he will likely also have seizures associated
with it, given his past history. Benzodiazepines are used to treat seizures associated with alcohol withdrawal.
Acamprosate, naltrexone, and disulfiram may be considered at a later time to treat the dependence, but would not
be useful in the acute withdrawal setting.
A 35-year-old man has been abusing cocaine and is agitated, tachycardic, hypertensive, and hyperthermic.
Which statement is correct regarding treatment in this situation?
A.  This patient should undergo gastric lavage; that is, he should have his stomach pumped immediately.
B.  Atropine should be administered to reverse the CNS depression that can occur with cocaine toxicity.
C.  Benzodiazepines should be administered to calm the patient and decrease heart rate, blood pressure, and body
temperature.
D.  Phenobarbital should be the first choice as an anticonvulsant.
Correct answer = C. Benzodiazepines such as lorazepam have anxiolytic properties and can calm a cocaine-toxic
patient, thereby decreasing heart rate and blood pressure. As the patient becomes less agitated, he/she decreases
movement and the body temperature drops. In addition, the use of benzodiazepines decreases the chance of the
patient experiencing a convulsion and would be the first choice to treat cocaine-induced convulsions.
A 22-year-old man with a history of substance abuse arrives in the emergency department hypertensive,
hyperthermic, and tachycardic. He also presents with an altered mental status and hyperreflexia. Which
substance is most likely causing these symptoms?
A.  LSD
B.  Bath salts
C.  Heroin
D.  Marijuana
Correct answer = B: “Bath salts” often contain synthetic cathinones and are labeled, marketed, and sold as
something “not for human consumption” to avoid law enforcement and prosecution. In addition, they are usually
not detected on urine toxicology screening so often evaluation of symptoms are used to distinguish the substance
taken. These products can cause an amphetamine-like sympathomimetic toxidrome, as well as serotonin
syndrome, which would be treated with symptomatic/supportive care and possibly a serotonin antagonist such as
cyproheptadine. LSD and marijuana would produce mostly psychological symptoms such as hallucinations and
paranoia, and opioids would produce depressive symptoms such as respiratory depression, hyperthermia, and
stupor.1785

45.10THC is a psychoactive alkaloid found in:
A.  N-bomb
B.  K2
C.  LSD
D.  Marijuana
Correct answer = D. THC is the main psychoactive alkaloid contained in marijuana. N-bomb is a synthetic
hallucinogen derived from mescaline. K2, also known as Spice or synthetic cannabis, is dried plant material,
which has been sprayed with synthetic chemicals that cause psychoactive effects. K2 does not contain THC. LSD
is also a psychoactive drug but contains lysergic acid diethylamine.
Which drug has clinical effects similar to those of cocaine?
A.  LSD
B.  Marijuana
C.  Methamphetamine
D.  Ethanol
Correct answer = C. Cocaine and methamphetamine have similar stimulant effects such as alertness, anxiety,
tachycardia, hypertension, and hyperthermia. This can lead to arrhythmias, stroke, or myocardial infarction. LSD
and marijuana cause primarily psychoactive effects such as hallucinations and paranoia, but have negligible to
minimal stimulant effects. Ethanol is a depressant, which often will produce the opposite effects of stimulants
including relaxation, drowsiness, and in high doses hypothermia.
Which drug leads to the formation of a cardiotoxic metabolite when administered with cocaine?
A.  Lorazepam
B.  Marijuana
C.  Ethanol
D.  Khat
Correct answer = C. Cocaine combined with ethanol forms cocaethylene, which may lead to aggressive and
impulsive behaviors as well as the potential for sudden myocardial infarction.
Which agent is often found as an adulterant in heroin and has led to an increase in overdose deaths?
A.  Spice
B.  Fentanyl
C.  Marijuana
D.  Cathinones
Correct answer = B. Fentanyl and its multitude of derivatives are often found in samples of heroin. Fentanyl
derivatives are often many times more potent than heroin or fentanyl, which has led to an alarming number of
overdoses in recent years.
Death secondary to MDMA use has occurred secondary to which adverse effect?
A.  Respiratory depression
B.  Acute kidney injury
C.  CNS depression
D.  Hyperthermia
Correct answer = D. MDMA, or Ecstasy, is a stimulant with similar properties to cocaine. The stimulant effects
may include hyperthermia, hypertension, and tachycardia.1786

I.  Overview
Protozoan parasites that cause human diseases are prevalent in underdeveloped tropical and subtropical countries,
where sanitary conditions, hygienic practices, and control of the vectors of transmission are inadequate. However,
with increased world travel, protozoal diseases are no longer confined to specific geographic locales. Because they
are unicellular eukaryotes, the protozoal cells have metabolic processes closer to those of the human host than to
prokaryotic bacterial pathogens. Therefore, protozoal diseases are less easily treated than bacterial infections, and
many of the antiprotozoal drugs cause serious toxic effects in the host, particularly on cells showing high metabolic
activity. Most antiprotozoal agents have not proven to be safe for pregnant patients. Drugs used to treat protozoal
infections are listed in Figure 46.1. [Note: Some of the drugs discussed below are not available in the United States;
however, most can be obtained by contacting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.]

II.  Chemotherapy for Amebiasis
Amebiasis (amebic dysentery) is an infection of the intestinal tract caused by Entamoeba histolytica . E. histolytica  is
endemic in developing countries and is mainly transmitted via the fecal–oral route or through ingestion of
contaminated food or water. Most infected individuals are asymptomatic but can exhibit varying degrees of illness
depending on host factors and formation of trophozoites. The diagnosis is established by isolating E. histolytica
from feces. Due to the risk of developing invasive disease and acting as a potential source of infection for others,
therapy is indicated for acutely ill patients and asymptomatic carriers of E. histolytica.  A summary of the life cycle
of E. histolytica  is presented in Figure 46.2. Therapeutic agents for amebiasis are classified as luminal, systemic, or
mixed amebicides according to the site of action (Figure 46.2). For example, luminal amebicides act on the parasite
in the lumen of the bowel, whereas systemic amebicides are effective against amebas in the intestinal wall and liver.
Mixed amebicides are effective against both the luminal and systemic forms of the disease, although luminal
concentrations are too low for single-drug treatment.
Figure 46.2 Life cycle of E. histolytica , showing the sites of action of amebicidal drugs.
1791
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1792 ---

A.  Mixed amebicides
1.  Metronidazole
Metronidazole [me-troe-NYE-da-zole], a nitroimidazole, is the mixed amebicide of choice for treating amebic
infections. [Note: Metronidazole is also used in the treatment of infections caused by Giardia lamblia , Trichomonas
vaginalis , anaerobic cocci, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (for example, Bacteroides  species), and anaerobic, gram-
positive bacilli (for example, Clostridium difficile) .]
a.  Mechanism of action
Amebas possess ferredoxin-like, low-redox-potential, electron transport proteins that participate in metabolic
electron removal reactions. The nitro group of metronidazole is able to serve as an electron acceptor, forming
reduced cytotoxic compounds that bind to proteins and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), resulting in death of the E .
histolytica  trophozoites.
b.  Pharmacokinetics
Metronidazole is completely and rapidly absorbed after oral administration. [Note: For the treatment of amebiasis, it
is usually administered with a luminal amebicide, such as iodoquinol  or paromomycin. This combination provides
cure rates of greater than 90%.] Metronidazole distributes well throughout body tissues and fluids. Therapeutic
levels can be found in vaginal and seminal fluids, saliva, breast milk, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Metabolism of
the drug depends on hepatic oxidation of the metronidazole side chain by mixed-function oxidase, followed by
glucuronidation. Therefore, concomitant treatment with inducers of the cytochrome P450, such as phenobarbital ,
enhances the rate of metabolism, and inhibitors, such as cimetidine, prolong the plasma half-life of metronidazole.
The drug accumulates in patients with severe hepatic disease. The parent drug and its metabolites are excreted in the
urine.
c.  Adverse effects
The most common adverse effects are nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress, and abdominal cramps ( Figure 46.3). An
unpleasant, metallic taste is commonly experienced. Other effects include oral moniliasis (yeast infection of the
mouth) and, rarely, neurotoxicity (dizziness, vertigo, and numbness or paresthesia), which may necessitate
discontinuation of the drug. If taken with alcohol, a disulfiram-like reaction may occur (see Chapter 45).

--- PAGE 1793 ---

Figure 46.3 Adverse effects of metronidazole. GI = gastrointestinal.
2.  Tinidazole
Tinidazole [tye-NI-da-zole] is a second-generation nitroimidazole that is similar to metronidazole in spectrum of
activity, absorption, adverse effects, and drug interactions. It is used for treatment of amebiasis, amebic liver
abscess, giardiasis, and trichomoniasis. Tinidazole is as effective as metronidazole, but it is more expensive. Alcohol
consumption should be avoided during therapy.
1793
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1794 ---

B.  Luminal amebicides
After treatment of invasive intestinal or extraintestinal amebic disease is complete, a luminal agent, such as
iodoquinol , diloxanide furoate, or paromomycin, should be administered for treatment of the asymptomatic
colonization state.
1.  Iodoquinol
Iodoquinol  [eye-oh-doe-QUIN-ole], a halogenated 8-hydroxyquinolone, is amebicidal against E . histolytica  and is
effective against the luminal trophozoite and cyst forms. Adverse effects of iodoquinol  include rash, diarrhea, and
dose-related peripheral neuropathy, including a rare optic neuritis. Long-term use of this drug should be avoided.
2.  Paromomycin
Paromomycin [par-oh-moe-MYE-sin], an aminoglycoside antibiotic, is only effective against the luminal forms of
E. histolytica , because it is not significantly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Paromomycin is directly
amebicidal and also exerts its antiamebic actions by reducing the population of intestinal flora. Gastrointestinal
distress and diarrhea are the principal adverse effects.
1794
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1795 ---

C.  Systemic amebicides
These drugs are useful for treating extraintestinal amebiasis, such as liver abscesses, and intestinal wall infections
caused by amebas.
1.  Chloroquine
Chloroquine [KLOR-oh-kwin] is used in combination with metronidazole (or as a substitute for one of the
nitroimidazoles in the case of intolerance) to treat amebic liver abscesses. It eliminates trophozoites in liver
abscesses, but it is not useful in treating luminal amebiasis. Therapy should be followed with a luminal amebicide.
Chloroquine is also effective in the treatment of malaria.
2.  Dehydroemetine
Dehydroemetine [de-hye-dro-EM-e-teen] is an alternative agent for the treatment of amebiasis. The drug inhibits
protein synthesis by blocking chain elongation. Intramuscular (IM) injection is the preferred route, since it is an
irritant when taken orally. The use of this ipecac alkaloid is limited by its toxicity, and it has largely been replaced
by metronidazole. Adverse effects include pain at the site of injection, nausea, cardiotoxicity (arrhythmias and
congestive heart failure), neuromuscular weakness, dizziness, and rash. A summary of the treatment of amebiasis is
shown in Figure 46.4.

III.  Chemotherapy for Malaria
Malaria is an acute infectious disease caused by five species of the protozoal genus Plasmodium . It is transmitted to
humans through the bite of a female Anopheles  mosquito. The classic presentation of malaria begins with headache
and fatigue, followed by fever, chills, and sweats. Plasmodium falciparum  is the most dangerous species and the
primary cause of severe malaria, causing an acute, rapidly fulminating disease characterized by persistent high fever,
hyperparasitemia, and organ system dysfunction. Plasmodium falciparum  infection can lead to capillary obstruction,
cerebral malaria, and death within days without prompt treatment. Plasmodium vivax , malariae,  and ovale  cause a
milder form of the disease; however, the P . vivax  and P . ovale  species can also remain dormant in the liver
(hypnozoite stage), which can cause relapses months or years later. Plasmodium knowlesi  is an uncommon form of
malaria, previously thought to infect only nonhuman primates, which causes human infections, sometimes severe, in
Southeast Asia. Resistance acquired by Plasmodium to antiprotozoal drugs has led to new therapeutic challenges,
particularly in the treatment of P . falciparum . A summary of the life cycle of the parasite and the sites of action of
the antimalarial drugs are presented in Figure 46.5.
Figure 46.5 Life cycle of the malarial parasite, showing the sites of action of antimalarial
drugs.
1796
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1797 ---

A.  Primaquine
Primaquine [PRIM-a-kwin], an 8-aminoquinoline, is an oral antimalarial drug that eradicates primary
exoerythrocytic (liver) forms of plasmodia and the hypnozoites of recurring malarias (P . vivax  and P . ovale ). [Note:
Primaquine is the only agent that prevents relapses of the P . vivax  and P . ovale  malarias, which may remain in the
liver in the hypnozoite form after the erythrocytic form of the disease is eliminated.] The sexual (gametocytic) forms
of all plasmodia are destroyed in the plasma or are prevented from maturing later in the mosquito, thereby
interrupting transmission of the disease. [Note: Primaquine is not effective against the erythrocytic stage of malaria
and, therefore, it cannot be used as monotherapy for treatment.]
1.  Mechanism of action
While not completely understood, metabolites of primaquine are believed to act as oxidants that severely disrupt the
metabolic processes of plasmodial mitochondria. The metabolites are responsible for the schizonticidal action, as
well as for the hemolysis and methemoglobinemia encountered as toxicities.
2.  Pharmacokinetics
Primaquine is well absorbed after oral administration and is not concentrated in tissues. It is rapidly oxidized to
many compounds, primarily the deaminated drug. Which compound possesses the schizonticidal activity has not
been established. The drug is minimally excreted in the urine.
3.  Adverse effects
Primaquine is associated with drug-induced hemolytic anemia in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
deficiency (Figure 46.6). Large doses of the drug may cause abdominal discomfort (especially when administered in
combination with chloroquine) and occasional methemoglobinemia. Primaquine should not be used during
pregnancy. All Plasmodium species may develop resistance to primaquine.

--- PAGE 1799 ---

B.  Chloroquine
Chloroquine is a synthetic 4-aminoquinoline that had been the mainstay of antimalarial therapy for many years;
however, the use is now limited due to P . falciparum  resistance, which is seen in almost all malaria-endemic areas,
except some parts of Central America. Chloroquine is less effective against P . vivax  malaria. Chloroquine is used in
the prophylaxis of malaria for travel to areas with known chloroquine-sensitive malaria. It is also effective in the
treatment of extraintestinal amebiasis.
1.  Mechanism of action
Although the mechanism of action is not fully understood, the processes essential for the antimalarial action of
chloroquine are outlined in Figure 46.7. After traversing the erythrocytic and plasmodial membranes, chloroquine (a
diprotic weak base) is concentrated in the acidic food vacuole of the malarial parasite, primarily by ion trapping. In
the food vacuole, the parasite digests the host cell’s hemoglobin to obtain essential amino acids. However, this
process also releases large amounts of soluble heme, which is toxic to the parasite. To protect itself, the parasite
polymerizes the heme to hemozoin (a pigment), which is sequestered in the food vacuole. Chloroquine specifically
binds to heme, preventing its polymerization to hemozoin. The increased pH and the accumulation of heme result in
oxidative damage to the phospholipid membranes, leading to lysis of both the parasite and the red blood cell.
Figure 46.7 Action of chloroquine on the formation of hemozoin by Plasmodium
species.
2.  Pharmacokinetics
Chloroquine is rapidly and completely absorbed following oral administration. The drug has a very large volume of
distribution and concentrates in erythrocytes, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, melanin-containing tissues, and leukocytes.
It persists in erythrocytes. The drug also penetrates the central nervous system (CNS) and traverses the placenta.
Chloroquine is dealkylated by the hepatic mixed-function oxidase system, and some metabolic products retain
antimalarial activity. Both parent drug and metabolites are excreted predominantly in urine.
3.  Adverse effects
Adverse effects are minimal at low prophylactic doses. At higher doses, gastrointestinal upset, pruritus, headaches,
and blurred vision may occur ( Figure 46.8). An ophthalmologic examination should be routinely performed during
extended use due to potential retinal toxicity. Discoloration of the nail beds and mucous membranes may be seen on
chronic administration. Chloroquine should be used cautiously in patients with hepatic dysfunction, severe
gastrointestinal problems, or neurologic disorders. Patients with psoriasis or porphyria should not be treated with
chloroquine, because an acute attack may be provoked. Chloroquine can prolong the QT interval, and use of other
drugs that also cause QT prolongation should be avoided if possible.

C.  Atovaquone–proguanil
The combination of atovaquone–proguanil  [a-TOE-va-kwone pro-GWA-nil] is effective for chloroquine-resistant
strains of P . falciparum , and it is used in the prevention and treatment of malaria for travelers from outside malaria-
endemic areas. Atovaquone–proguanil  is not routinely used in endemic areas due to propensity for emergence of
high-level resistance. Atovaquone is a hydroxynaphthoquinone which inhibits mitochondrial processes including
electron transport, as well as ATP and pyrimidine biosynthesis. Cycloguanil, the active triazine metabolite of
proguanil , inhibits plasmodial dihydrofolate reductase, thereby preventing DNA synthesis. Atovaquone also may be
used to treat Babesia  sp. and Pneumocystis jirovecii . Proguanil  is metabolized via CYP2C19, an isoenzyme that is
known to exhibit a genetic polymorphism resulting in poor metabolism of the drug in some patients. The
combination should be taken with food or milk to enhance absorption. Common adverse effects include nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, diarrhea, anorexia, and dizziness.
1801
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1802 ---

D.  Mefloquine
Mefloquine [MEF-lo-kwin] is a 4-methanolquinoline, structurally related to quinine, which is an effective agent for
prophylaxis from all plasmodia, and for treatment when used in combination with an artemisinin derivative for
infections caused by multidrug-resistant forms of P . falciparum . Its exact mechanism of action remains
undetermined. Resistant strains have been identified, particularly in Southeast Asia. Mefloquine is well absorbed
after oral administration and is widely distributed to tissues. It has a long half-life (20 days) because of enterohepatic
recirculation and its concentration in various tissues. The drug undergoes extensive metabolism and is primarily
excreted via the bile into the feces. Adverse reactions at high doses range from nausea, vomiting, and dizziness to
disorientation, hallucinations, and depression. Because of the potential for neuropsychiatric reactions, mefloquine is
usually reserved for treatment of malaria when other agents cannot be used. Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities
and cardiac arrest are possible if mefloquine is taken concurrently with quinine or quinidine.
1802
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1803 ---

E.  Quinine
Quinine [KWYE-nine], an alkaloid originally isolated from the bark of the cinchona tree, interferes with heme
polymerization, resulting in death of the erythrocytic form of the plasmodial parasite. It is reserved for severe
infections and for chloroquine-resistant malarial strains. Quinine is usually administered in combination with
doxycycline, tetracycline, or clindamycin. Taken orally, quinine is well distributed throughout the body. The major
adverse effect of quinine is cinchonism, a syndrome causing nausea, vomiting, tinnitus, and vertigo. These effects
are reversible and are not reasons for suspending therapy. However, quinine treatment should be suspended if
hemolytic anemia occurs.
1803

--- PAGE 1804 ---

F.  Artemisinin
Artemisinin [ar-te-MIS-in-in] is derived from the sweet wormwood plant, which has been used in traditional Chinese
medicine for many centuries. Artemisinin and its derivatives are recommended first-line agents for the treatment of
multidrug-resistant P . falciparum  malaria. Addition of another antimalarial agent, or artemisinin-based combination
therapy (ACT), is recommended to prevent the development of resistance. One orally available ACT includes a
tablet with artemether coformulated with lumefantrine [AR-te-meth-er/loo-me-FAN-treen] and is used for the
treatment of uncomplicated malaria. [Note: Lumefantrine is an antimalarial drug similar in action to quinine or
mefloquine.] Artesunate [ar-TEZ-oo-nate] may be combined with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine, mefloquine,
clindamycin, or others. The antimalarial action of artemisinin derivatives involves the production of free radicals
resulting from cleavage of the drug’s endoperoxide bridge by heme iron in the parasite food vacuole. Oral, rectal,
IM and intravenous (IV) preparations are available, but the short half-lives preclude the use of these drugs for
prophylaxis. Adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. High doses may cause prolongation of the QT
interval. Hypersensitivity reactions and rash have occurred.
1804
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1805 ---

G.  Pyrimethamine
Pyrimethamine [peer-i-METH-a-meen] inhibits plasmodial dihydrofolate reductase required for the synthesis of
tetrahydrofolate (a cofactor needed for synthesis of nucleic acids). It acts as a blood schizonticide and a strong
sporonticide when the mosquito ingests it with the blood of the human host. Pyrimethamine is not used alone for
malaria; it is available as a fixed-dose combination with sulfadoxine, a sulfonamide antimicrobial. Resistance to this
combination has developed, so it is usually administered with other agents, such as artemisinin derivatives.
Pyrimethamine in combination with sulfadiazine is also used against Toxoplasma gondii. If megaloblastic anemia
occurs with pyrimethamine treatment, it may be reversed with leucovorin. Figure 46.9 shows some therapeutic
options in the treatment of malaria.

malaria-endemic areas or added to combination regimen for alternative treatment
regimens.†Artemisinin-based combination therapy is preferred according to World Health
Organization.

IV.  Chemotherapy for Trypanosomiasis
African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) and American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease) are two chronic and,
eventually, fatal diseases caused by species of Trypanosoma  (Figure 46.10). In African sleeping sickness, T . brucei
gambiense  and T . brucei rhodesiense  initially live and grow in the blood. The parasite later invades the CNS,
causing inflammation of the brain and spinal cord that produces the characteristic lethargy and, eventually,
continuous sleep. Chagas disease is caused by T. cruzi  and is endemic in Central and South America.
Antitrypanosomal drugs are outlined below.

--- PAGE 1810 ---

A.  Pentamidine
Pentamidine [pen-TAM-i-deen] is active against a variety of protozoal infections, including African trypanosomiasis
due to T . brucei gambiense , for which it is used to treat the early stages of disease (hemolymphatic stage without
CNS involvement). Pentamidine is also an alternative for prophylaxis or treatment of infections caused by
Pneumocystis jirovecii . [Note: P. jirovecii  is an atypical fungus that causes pneumonia in immunocompromised
patients, such as those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is
preferred in the treatment of P . jirovecii  infections; however, pentamidine is an alternative in individuals who are
allergic to sulfonamides.] Pentamidine is also an alternative drug for the treatment of leishmaniasis.
1.  Mechanism of action
T. brucei  concentrates pentamidine by an energy-dependent, high-affinity uptake system. [Note: Resistance is
associated with inability to concentrate the drug.] Although its mechanism of action has not been defined, evidence
exists that the drug interferes with parasite synthesis of ribonucleic acid (RNA), DNA, phospholipids, and proteins.
2.  Pharmacokinetics
Pentamidine is administered intramuscularly or intravenously for the treatment of trypanosomiasis and pneumonia
caused by P . jirovecii . [Note: For prophylaxis of P . jirovecii  pneumonia, pentamidine is administered via nebulizer.]
The drug distributes widely and is concentrated in the liver, kidney, adrenals, spleen, and lungs. Because it does not
enter the CSF, it is ineffective against the late stages (CNS involvement) of trypanosomiasis. The drug is not
metabolized, and it is excreted very slowly in the urine.
3.  Adverse effects
Serious renal dysfunction may occur, which is reversible on discontinuation. Other adverse reactions include
hyperkalemia, hypotension, pancreatitis, ventricular arrhythmias, and hyperglycemia. Plasma glucose should be
monitored, as life threatening hypoglycemia can occur.

--- PAGE 1811 ---

B.  Suramin
Suramin [SOO-ra-min] is used primarily in the early stage (without CNS involvement) of African trypanosomiasis
due to T . brucei rhodesiense . It is very reactive and inhibits many enzymes, especially those involved in energy
metabolism, which appears to be the mechanism correlated with trypanocidal activity. Suramin must be injected
intravenously. It binds to plasma proteins and does not penetrate the blood–brain barrier well. It has a long
elimination half-life (greater than 40 days) and is mainly excreted unchanged in the urine. Although infrequent,
adverse reactions include nausea and vomiting, shock and loss of consciousness, acute urticaria, blepharitis, and
neurologic problems, such as paresthesia, photophobia, and hyperesthesia of the hands and feet. Renal insufficiency
may occur but tends to resolve with discontinuation of treatment. Acute hypersensitivity reactions may occur, and a
test dose should be given prior to drug administration.

--- PAGE 1812 ---

C.  Melarsoprol
Melarsoprol  [mel-AR-so-prol], a trivalent arsenical compound, is the only medication available for treatment of late
stages of African trypanosome infections (CNS involvement) due to T . brucei rhodesiense . The drug reacts with
sulfhydryl groups of various substances, including enzymes in both the organism and host. Some resistance has been
noted, and it may be due to decreased transporter uptake of the drug. Melarsoprol  is administered by slow IV
injection and can be very irritating to the surrounding tissue. Adequate trypanocidal concentrations appear in the
CSF, making melarsoprol  the agent of choice in the treatment of T. brucei rhodesiense, which rapidly invades the
CNS. The host readily oxidizes melarsoprol  to a relatively nontoxic, pentavalent arsenic compound. The drug has a
very short half-life and is rapidly excreted in urine. The use of melarsoprol  is limited by CNS toxicity, including
reactive encephalopathy, which can be fatal in 10% of cases. Other adverse effects include peripheral neuropathy,
hypertension, hepatotoxicity, and albuminuria. Hypersensitivity reactions may also occur, and febrile reactions may
follow injection. Hemolytic anemia has been seen in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.

D.  Eflornithine
Eflornithine [ee-FLOOR-nih-theen] is an irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase. Inhibition of this enzyme
halts the production of polyamines in the parasite, thereby leading to cessation of cell division. The IV formulation
of eflornithine is a first-line treatment for late-stage African trypanosomiasis caused by T. brucei gambiense . [Note:
Topical eflornithine is used as a treatment for unwanted facial hair in women.] The short half-life of eflornithine
necessitates frequent IV administration, making the treatment regimen difficult to follow. Eflornithine is less toxic
than melarsoprol , although the drug is associated with anemia, seizures, and temporary hearing loss.

E.  Nifurtimox
Nifurtimox [nye-FER-tim-oks] is used in the treatment of T . cruzi  infections (Chagas disease), although treatment of
the chronic stage of such infections has led to variable results. It may also be useful for the treatment of late-stage T .
brucei gambiense  in combination with eflornithine. Being a nitroaromatic compound, nifurtimox undergoes
reduction and eventually generates intracellular oxygen radicals, such as superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide
(Figure 46.11). These highly reactive radicals are toxic to T . cruzi . Nifurtimox is administered orally. It is
extensively metabolized, and the metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine. Adverse effects are common
following chronic administration, particularly among the elderly. Major toxicities include hypersensitivity reactions
(anaphylaxis, dermatitis) and gastrointestinal problems that may be severe enough to cause weight loss. Peripheral
neuropathy is relatively common, and headache and dizziness may also occur.

F.  Benznidazole
Benznidazole [benz-NI-da-zole] is a nitroimidazole derivative with a mechanism of action similar to nifurtimox. It
tends to be better tolerated than nifurtimox for the treatment of Chagas disease. Adverse effects include dermatitis,
peripheral neuropathy, insomnia, and anorexia.

V.  Chemotherapy for Leishmaniasis
Leishmaniasis is a protozoal infection caused by various species of the genus Leishmania . There are three
manifestations of leishmaniasis: cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and visceral. [Note: In the visceral type (liver and
spleen), the parasite is in the bloodstream and if untreated is fatal.] Leishmaniasis is transmitted by the bite of
infected sandflies. For visceral leishmaniasis, parenteral treatments may include amphotericin B  (see Chapter 33)
and pentavalent antimonials, such as sodium stibogluconate or meglumine antimoniate with pentamidine and
paromomycin as alternative agents. Miltefosine is an orally active agent for visceral leishmaniasis. The choice of
agent depends on the species of Leishmania, host factors, and resistance patterns noted in area of the world where
the infection is acquired.
1818

--- PAGE 1819 ---

A.  Sodium stibogluconate
The pentavalent antimonial sodium stibogluconate [stib-o-GLOO-koe-nate] is a prodrug which is reduced to the
active trivalent antimonial compound. The exact mechanism of action has not been determined. Because it is not
absorbed after oral administration, sodium stibogluconate must be administered parenterally, and it is distributed in
the extravascular compartment. Metabolism is minimal, and the drug is excreted in urine. Adverse effects include
injection site pain, pancreatitis, elevated liver enzymes, arthralgias, myalgias, gastrointestinal upset, and cardiac
arrhythmias. Resistance to the pentavalent antimonials has developed.
1819
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1820 ---

B.  Miltefosine
Miltefosine [mil-te-FOE-zeen] is the first orally active drug for visceral leishmaniasis and can also treat cutaneous
and mucocutaneous forms of the disease. The precise mechanism of action is not known, but miltefosine appears to
interfere with phospholipids and sterols in the parasitic cell membrane to induce apoptosis. Nausea and vomiting are
common adverse reactions. The drug is teratogenic and should be avoided in pregnancy.

--- PAGE 1821 ---

VI.  Chemotherapy for Toxoplasmosis
One of the most common infections in humans is caused by the protozoan T . gondii , which is transmitted to humans
when they consume raw, inadequately cooked infected meat, or accidentally ingest oocysts from cat feces. An
infected pregnant woman can transmit T . gondii  to her fetus. The treatment of choice for this condition is a
combination of sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine. Leucovorin is commonly administered to protect against folate
deficiency. [Note: At the first appearance of a rash, pyrimethamine should be discontinued, because hypersensitivity
to this drug can be severe.] Pyrimethamine with clindamycin or the combination of trimethoprim and
sulfamethoxazole are alternative treatments. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is used for prophylaxis against
toxoplasmosis (as well as P . jirovecii ) in immunocompromised patients.

--- PAGE 1822 ---

VII.  Chemotherapy for Giardiasis
Giardia lamblia  is the most commonly diagnosed intestinal parasite in the United States. It has two life cycle stages:
the binucleate trophozoite with four flagella, and the drug-resistant, four-nucleate cyst (Figure 46.12). Ingestion
usually occurs from fecally contaminated drinking water or food, leading to infection. The trophozoites exist in the
small intestine and divide by binary fission. Occasionally, cysts are formed that pass out in stools. Although some
infections are asymptomatic, severe diarrhea can occur, which can be very serious in immunocompromised patients.
The treatment of choice is oral metronidazole for 5 days. An alternative is a single dose of tinidazole, which is as
effective as metronidazole in the treatment of giardiasis. Nitazoxanide [nye-ta-ZOX-a-nide], a nitrothiazole
derivative, is also approved for the treatment of giardiasis. [Note: Nitazoxanide may also be used for
cryptosporidiosis (a diarrheal illness most commonly seen in immunocompromised patients) caused by the parasite
Cryptosporidium parvum.] For giardiasis, nitazoxanide is administered as a 3-day course of oral therapy. The
anthelmintic drug albendazole may also be efficacious for giardiasis, and paromomycin is sometimes used for
treatment of giardiasis in pregnant patients.

histolytica ?
A.  Chloroquine
B.  Iodoquinol
C.  Metronidazole
D.  Primaquine
Correct answer = B. Iodoquinol, diloxanide furoate, and paromomycin are luminal amebicides that are usually
administered with mixed or systemic amebicides to treat the asymptomatic colonization state. Chloroquine is a
systemic amebicide and an antimalarial. Metronidazole is a mixed amebicide. Primaquine is an antimalarial.
A group of college students are traveling to a chloroquine-resistant malaria area for a mission trip. Which
medication can be used to both prevent and treat malaria in these students?
A.  Pyrimethamine
B.  Artemisinin
C.  Atovaquone–proguanil
D.  Hydroxychloroquine
Correct answer = C. The combination of atovaquone–proguanil has been used for both prevention and treatment
of malaria in chloroquine-resistant areas. Pyrimethamine is not recommended for prophylaxis of malaria.
Artemisinin and its derivatives are not used for prophylaxis, only treatment of malaria. Hydroxychloroquine is
only an alternative treatment or prophylaxis option in chloroquine-sensitive regions.
Which agent is available as an oral therapy for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis?
A.  Artemether/lumefantrine
B.  Miltefosine
C.  Nitazoxanide
D.  Tinidazole
Correct answer = B. Miltefosine is the only oral agent available for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis. All the
other drugs are orally administered, but artemether/lumefantrine is used for the treatment of malaria, nitazoxanide
is used for the treatment of giardiasis or cryptosporidiosis, and tinidazole is effective for amebiasis or giardiasis.
A 27-year-old woman is diagnosed with African trypanosomal infection due to T. brucei rhodesiense. Which
medication would be the best for this patient?
A.  Eflornithine
B.  Suramin
C.  Sodium stibogluconate
D.  Metronidazole
Correct answer = B. Eflornithine is indicated for the treatment of African trypanosomiasis caused by T. bruceigambiense . Suramin is used for the treatment of first-stage African trypanosomiasis due to T. brucei rhodesiense .
Sodium stibogluconate is used for the treatment of leishmaniasis. Metronidazole is used for the treatment of
amebiasis and giardiasis.

--- PAGE 1825 ---

46.7
46.8
46.9
46.10Correct answer = D. Metronidazole is used for the treatment of amebiasis and giardiasis. Chloroquine is used for
the treatment of malaria and extra intestinal amebiasis. Nifurtimox is indicated for the treatment of American
trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease) caused by T. cruzi. Paromomycin is used for the treatment of luminal forms of
E. histolytica .
Which statement regarding paromomycin is correct?
A.  Paromomycin is only effective against the luminal forms of E. histolytica .
B.  The principle adverse effects are optic neuritis and peripheral neuropathy.
C.  Paromomycin is considered a nitroimidazole.
D.  If taken with alcohol, a disulfiram-like reaction may occur.
Correct answer = A. Paromomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic, known as a luminal amebicide. It is only
active effective against the luminal forms of E. histolytica because it is not significantly absorbed from the
gastrointestinal tract. The principle adverse effects are gastrointestinal distress and diarrhea. The nitroimidazoles
should be avoided with alcohol consumption due to the risk of a disulfiram-like reaction.
Which treatment option is most appropriate for a patient diagnosed with uncomplicated malaria due to P.
ovale ?
A.  Artesunate plus mefloquine
B.  Doxycycline
C.  Chloroquine
D.  Chloroquine plus primaquine
Correct answer = D. Chloroquine plus primaquine is the most appropriate treatment option due to the species of
malaria, P. ovale , which causes relapses from the dormant hypnozoite form unless primaquine is added.
Chloroquine by itself would treat the acute infection; however, it would not prevent relapse of the disease.
Doxycycline is only used for prophylaxis or as a combination with other antimalarial medications for treatment.
Artesunate plus mefloquine would be more appropriate to treat severe malaria; however, neither agent would
prevent the relapsing form of the disease caused by P. ovale .
Which antiprotozoal agent is active against Toxoplasma gondii ?
A.  Metronidazole
B.  Pyrimethamine
C.  Leucovorin
D.  Miltefosine
Correct answer= B. Pyrimethamine is active against T. gondii and in combination with sulfadiazine is the
treatment of choice for toxoplasmosis. Metronidazole is active against amebiasis and giardiasis. Leucovorin can
be used during the treatment of toxoplasmosis; however, its actions are to protect against folate deficiency caused
by the treatment, and the drug itself does not have antiprotozoal activity. Miltefosine is used for leishmaniasis.
A 32-year-old pregnant woman is traveling abroad to a malaria-endemic country with known chloroquine
resistance. Which prophylactic regimen is most  appropriate?
A.  Doxycycline
B.  Mefloquine
C.  Primaquine
D.  Artemether–lumefantrine
Correct answer = B. Mefloquine is one of the preferred regimens for malaria prophylaxis in a pregnant woman.
Doxycycline and primaquine are not recommended for use in pregnancy. Artemether–lumefantrine is only
recommended for the treatment, not prophylaxis, of malaria.

--- PAGE 1827 ---

I.  Overview
Nematodes, trematodes, and cestodes are three major groups of helminths (worms) that infect humans. Anthelmintic
drugs (Figure 47.1) are aimed at metabolic targets that are present in the parasite but either are absent from or have
different characteristics than those of the host. Figure 47.2 illustrates the high incidence of helmintic infections
worldwide. Most anthelmintics target eliminating the organisms from the host, as well as controlling spread of
infections.

II.  Drugs for the Treatment of Nematodes
Nematodes are elongated roundworms that possess a complete digestive system. They cause infections of the
intestine as well as the blood and tissues.
1829
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1830 ---

A.  Mebendazole
Mebendazole [me-BEN-da-zole], a synthetic benzimidazole compound, is a first-line agent for the treatment of
infections caused by whipworms (Trichuris trichiura ), pinworms (Enterobius vermicularis ), hookworms (Necator
americanus  and Ancylostoma duodenale ), and roundworms (Ascaris lumbricoides ). Mebendazole, and
benzimidazoles as a class, act by binding to parasite β-tubulin and inhibiting microtubule polymerization in the
parasite. Affected parasites are expelled in the feces. Adverse effects include abdominal pain and diarrhea.
Mebendazole should not be used in pregnant women. [Note: Many anthelmintics should be avoided in pregnancy
(Figure 47.3); however, in mass prevention or treatment programs, certain agents (for example, mebendazole or
albendazole) may be used in the second or third trimester.]
Figure 47.3 Albendazole, ivermectin, mebendazole, and thiabendazole should be avoided
in pregnancy.

--- PAGE 1831 ---

B.  Pyrantel pamoate
Pyrantel pamoate [pi-RAN-tel PAM-oh-ate] is also effective in the treatment of infections caused by roundworms,
pinworms, and hookworms (Figure 47.4). Pyrantel pamoate is poorly absorbed after oral administration and is only
effective against intestinal infections. It acts as a depolarizing, neuromuscular-blocking agent, causing release of
acetylcholine and inhibition of cholinesterase, leading to paralysis of the worm and subsequent expulsion. Adverse
effects are mild and include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Figure 47.4 Characteristics of and therapy for commonly encountered nematode
infections.
1831
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1832 ---

C.  Thiabendazole
Thiabendazole [thye-a-BEN-da-zole], a synthetic benzimidazole, is a potent broad-spectrum anthelmintic agent.
Current use of thiabendazole is limited to the topical treatment of cutaneous larva migrans (creeping eruption).
Because of its toxic effects and removal from the market in many countries, it has been largely replaced by other
agents.
1832
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1833 ---

D.  Ivermectin
Ivermectin [eye-ver-MEK-tin] is the drug of choice for the treatment of cutaneous larva migrans, strongyloidiasis,
and onchocerciasis (river blindness, although not curative due to lack of activity in adult worms). [Note: Ivermectin
is also useful in the treatment of pediculosis (lice) and scabies.] Ivermectin targets the glutamate-gated chloride
channel receptors. Chloride influx is enhanced, and hyperpolarization occurs, resulting in paralysis and death of the
worm. The drug is given orally and does not readily cross the blood–brain barrier. Ivermectin should not be used in
pregnancy (see Figure 47.3). The killing of the microfilaria in onchocerciasis can result in a dangerous Mazzotti
reaction (fever, headache, dizziness, somnolence, and hypotension). The severity of this reaction is related to
parasite load. Antihistamines or steroids may be given to ameliorate the symptoms.
1833
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1834 ---

E.  Diethylcarbamazine
Diethylcarbamazine [dye-eth-il-kar-BAM-a-zeen] is the drug of choice for filariasis caused by infection with
Wuchereria bancrofti , Brugia malayi,  or Brugia timori . It kills the microfilariae and has activity against adult worms.
[Note: In countries where filariasis is endemic, a combination of antifilarial drugs (either diethylcarbamazine and
albendazole or ivermectin and albendazole) may be used annually as preventive chemotherapy.]
Diethylcarbamazine is rapidly absorbed following oral administration with meals and is excreted mainly in the
urine. Adverse effects may include fever, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, and headache. [Note: Patients suspected of
having onchocerciasis should be given ivermectin and albendazole because diethylcarbamazine can accelerate
blindness and cause severe Mazzotti reactions.]

III.  Drugs for the Treatment of Trematodes
The trematodes (flukes) are leaf-shaped flatworms that are generally characterized by the tissues they infect (for
example, liver, lung, intestinal, or blood; Figure 47.5).
Figure 47.5 Characteristics of and therapy for commonly encountered trematode
infections. GI = gastrointestinal.
1835
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1836 ---

A.  Praziquantel
Praziquantel  [pray-zi-KWON-tel] is an agent of choice for the treatment of all forms of schistosomiasis, other
trematode infections, and cestode infections such as taeniasis. Praziquantel  causes contracture and paralysis of
parasites by increasing the permeability of the cell membrane to calcium. It is rapidly absorbed after oral
administration and should be taken with food. The drug is extensively metabolized, and the inactive metabolites are
excreted primarily in the urine. Common adverse effects include dizziness, malaise, and headache as well as
gastrointestinal upset. Dexamethasone, phenytoin, rifampin, and carbamazepine may increase the metabolism of
praziquantel . Cimetidine causes increased praziquantel  levels. Praziquantel  is contraindicated for the treatment of
ocular cysticercosis, because destruction of the organism in the eye may cause irreversible damage.
1836
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1837 ---

IV.  Drugs for the Treatment of Cestodes
The cestodes, or “true tapeworms,” typically have a flat, segmented body and attach to the host’s intestine ( Figure
47.6). Like the trematodes, the tapeworms lack a mouth and a digestive tract throughout their life cycle.

--- PAGE 1838 ---

A.  Niclosamide
Niclosamide [ni-KLOE-sa-mide] (no longer available in the United States) is an alternative to praziquantel  for the
treatment of taeniasis, diphyllobothriasis, and other cestode infections. It inhibits the mitochondrial phosphorylation
of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) in the parasite, making it lethal for the cestode’s scolex and segments but not for
the ova. A laxative is administered prior to oral administration to purge the bowel of all dead segments and to
enhance digestion and liberation of the ova. Alcohol should be avoided within 1 day of niclosamide use.
1838
www.webofpharma.com

--- PAGE 1839 ---

B.  Albendazole
Albendazole [al-BEN-da-zole], another benzimidazole, inhibits microtubule synthesis and glucose uptake in
nematodes and is effective against most nematodes known. Its primary therapeutic application, however, is in the
treatment of cestodal infestations, such as cysticercosis and hydatid disease (caused by larval stage of Echinococcusgranulosus ). [Note: Albendazole is also very effective in treating microsporidiosis, a fungal infection.] Albendazole
is erratically absorbed after oral administration, but absorption is enhanced by a high-fat meal. It undergoes
extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver, including formation of an active sulfoxide, and its metabolites are
primarily excreted in the bile. When used in short-course therapy (1 to 3 days) for nematodal infestations, adverse
effects are mild and transient and include headache and nausea. Treatment of hydatid disease (3 months) has a risk
of hepatotoxicity and, rarely, agranulocytosis or pancytopenia. Medical treatment of neurocysticercosis is associated
with inflammatory responses to dying parasites in the central nervous system (CNS), including headache, vomiting,
fever, and seizures.
